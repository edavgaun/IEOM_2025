Abstract 
 
Private companies in India still facing low employee engagement problem. As per Gallup worldwide employee 
engagement is at unexpectedly low 13%. An organization needs to be come up with innovative policies to address 
this issue. In the modern competitive world, it's crucial for organizations to focus on their manpower and 
understand what are the factors which drive employee engagement. This study attempts to understand the major 
job and organizational related factors which affects employee engagement in the private sector of India. 
Independent variables included in this study are Job characteristics, organizational support, work-life balance, 
role benefits and innovation at the workplace. Dependent variable for this study is employee engagement. Initially, 
it was assumed that there is a positive relationship between all independent variables and dependent variable. 
Survey data collected from private companies and the number of respondents was 141 with a 68% response rate. 
The result of   the study has shown all independent variables excluding job characteristics are significant for 
employee engagement. The study also suggests that organization need to come up with innovative practices and 
policies to minimize disengaged employees and need to convert moderately engaged employees to improve the 
productivity of the organization, decrease incurred costs and increase profits. 
 
Keywords 
Job characteristics, Organizational support, Work-life balance, Innovative workplace behavior and Employee 
engagement. 
 
1. Introduction 
Engaged employees as those who are involved in enthusiastic about and committed to their work and workplace. 
To create an environment or people flourish employer needs to understand what is meant to be engaged with an 
employee and how to manage people in their workforce. Employee engagement is about individual and 
organizational performance. Employees who are engaged based on key workplace elements predict important 
organizational performance. 
 
When your employees are engaged, they don’t just become just happier they become better performers. 
Organizations falter in creating a culture of engagement when they solely approach engagement as an exercise in 
making their employees feel happy. Simply measuring satisfaction and catering to their wants often to fail to 
achieve the underlying goal of the employee engagement – improved outcomes. Although the concept of 
employee engagement and job satisfaction are interrelated, they are not synonymous. Satisfaction means an 
employee is happy with their job or organization. Satisfaction is an attitude like organizational loyalty or pride. 
Engagement is about employees are actively invested in their work and value they add to the organization. 
 
When employees are engaged, they become emotionally attached to their work and workplace. As a result, their 
individual performance soars, and they propel their team and organization to improved outcomes such as higher 
levels of productivity, safety, and quality. Engaged employees do more work highly engaged organizations realize

Abstract 
The contemporaneous competitive global economy, it’s a formidable requisite to meet the dynamic customer needs 
and demands which are often region specific. It is all about the ability to adapt rapidly to handle changing customer 
demands. Agile manufacturing helps in swiftly adjusting the existing manufacturing process to the dynamic customer 
needs both in terms of new features built into the product and technological change with a special focus on cost. 
Current study involves integrating two assembly lines that were manufacturing air compressors of different capacities 
into one single assembly line. The newly integrated line ought to be capable of handling product variants. Each variant 
has its own product features with possibilities for human error. Industry 4.0 – an enabler to develop an integrated 
quality embedded process will ensure the prevention of human error. In the aforementioned line integration process, 
lean tools such as Value stream mapping (VSM) an effective lean tool that helps to identify the value added and non-
value-added activities; Eliminate – Combine - Rearrange - Simplify (ECRS) an approach that helps to optimize the 
process and Line balancing a production strategy to meet the optimal production rate were inculcated to eliminate the 
shortcomings. The study evaluated the current state and future state of the processes through VSM, thereby obtaining 
an insight about the ever-evolving market demand, TAKT time, cycle time and nine wastes involved in the processes 
that determined the scope for improvement. Introduction of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) 
application helped in manufacturing the multi-variants in a single line, acted as an advanced poke yoke system to 
reduce human error that also enlisted data to improve the processes. Kaizen implements were generated with a 
brainstorming session with members from Cross Functional Teams (CFT). After line integration and implementing 
kaizens and incorporating line balancing, it was observed that the line capacity enhanced by 9.25 %, with a cycle time 
reduction by 29.94%, besides improvement in the line- agility from 68 % to 100% and optimizing the need by two 
manpower.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing organizations are trying to become the choice of all their customers by providing the products on time 
with better than the best quality and with optimum cost to ensure the long-term relationship with the customers. This 
project deals with capacity enhancement by integrating two different assembly lines to meet the fluctuating customer 
demands with flexibility in line design. Manufacturers are actively working to meet the needs of customers; they 
operate actively to represent their customers with better than the best quality and cost of their products (Fritzsche 
2018). The lean tools would support to achieve this (Kumar et al, 2020). Lean tools aid manufacturers by allowing 
them to reduce waste (Laksono et al. 2019). Therefore, it is useful for a manufacturer to reach the optimum productivity 
of production. Industries adopt numerous aids like VSM, 5S, Poka -yoke, SMED etc. to enhance their company’s 
performance and value (Boysen, 2008). Value stream mapping is a good tool to highlight an organization’s current

7. Conclusion
The study was initiated with the prime objective of increasing the capacity, improving line agility and flexibility by 
integrating two assembly lines in to a single assembly line. By using the VSM tool, the current state and future state 
of the assembly line were adjudged. The current state mapping envisions potential to improve the capacity and 
flexibility of the line through kaizen bursts. These kaizens along with beneficial inputs from the implementation of 
SCADA application and ECRS approach, enthralls opportunities for cycle time reduction, capacity improvement and 
productivity improvement. Elicited from these improvements, the future state mapping was revamped by blending the 
strategy of Line Balancing, resulting in two additional stations.By the virtue of these additional stations in tandem 
with the required manpower, it is observed that there is an increase in the line capacity from 45 to 54 units (per shift) 
along with assembly time reduction by 29.94% including two manpower optimization and 160Sq.mts of space saving. 
Way forward, by extending the horizon of the captivation of SCADA in the multi-model assembly line, there is an 
immense prospect to evolve not only the flexibility of the line, but also paving way for accommodating futuristic 
proto-models with utmost ease of assembly with bare minimum human interventions. Thus, by implementing multi 
product assembly line through the medium of industry 4.0 and lean tools establishes itself to be a stronger predecessor 
for Industry 5.0 which would become inevitable in near future.

Abstract 
Commercial apiculture plays an important role because of its contributions to reducing poverty and conserving 
biodiversity. In this paper, honey production by migratory bee colonies are considered. A group of beekeepers move 
from one region to another region for harvesting honey. The problem involves finding routing plan for the migratory 
beekeepers to optimize the total profit of beekeepers, comprehensively considering several constraints. A variable 
neighbourhood search (VNS) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. A numerical experiment is performed to test 
to test the effectiveness of the proposed VNS. The results indicate the feasibility and efficiency of the VNS to achieve 
good near-optimal solutions while reducing computation time sharply compared to exact algorithms. The outcome of 
this paper can help related organizations to change traditional production and operation methods, enhancing production 
efficiency and profit and reducing costs and resource waste.

Abstract 
The background of this paper is to find out the predominant types of defects that occurs during the fabrication of 
pump fed rocket engines. Pump fed rocket engine which works on gas generator cycle is used in operational 
launch vehicles. The number of non-conformances are to be reduced to improve the reliability of the engine. 
The non-conformances reported during fabrication of twenty numbers of the engine realised over a period of 
four years are classified under different heads. Pareto analysis was carried out and found that the non-
conformances due to weld shrinkage (process limitation), operator mistakes (human error) and free condition 
ovality (raw material) are the pre-dominant ones. The suggestions for process improvement leading to reduction 
in non-conformances per engine are also highlighted in this paper. 
Keywords 
Rocket engines, Fabrication, Pareto analysis, Non-conformances and Weld shrinkage. 
1. Introduction
Pump fed rocket engine which works on gas generator cycle is used in operational launch vehicles. The major 
sub-assemblies of the engine are Engine On & off valves, Gas generator, Turbo pump, Main injector, 
Combustion chamber & Nozzle assembly, Thrust regulators, Mixture ratio regulators and POGO correctors.  
Each engine consists of 355 types of fabricated components. The fabrication process involves machining, 
forming, welding, heat treatment, surface treatment, match machining, wear resistant coating, etc. On an average 
forty two non-conformances are reported per engine. As part of continuous improvement as well as to increase 
the reliability, there is an urgent need to reduce the number of non-conformances (N.Cs). Hence, finding out and 
resolving the predominant factors contributing for the N.Cs are of utmost importance to improve the reliability 
of the engine.  In the present study N.Cs noticed during the fabrication of twenty numbers of engines realised 
over a period of four years are classified under different heads. Pareto principle is applied to find out the 
predominant N.Cs which needs immediate action to reduce the number of N.Cs as part of continuous quality 
enhancement and to reduce the lead time for NC processing and assessment. This paper also suggests the 
improvements that can be incorporated to avoid the predominant non-conformances so that the no. of N.Cs per 
engine can be reduced to a target value of less than ten numbers. 
Rejection of a component leads to loss of machine and man hours, loss of expensive aerospace quality raw 
materials and increase in lead time of fabrication. Increase in the number of NCs leads to loss of man-hours and 
money for analysing the NCs, a risk of taking a wrong decision on NC which may be catastrophic during the 
mission and fatigue to inspectors leading to possible non-reporting of an NC. 
1.1 Objectives  
The main objective is to find out the predominant type of N.Cs during the fabrication of pump fed rocket engine. 
2. Literature Review
Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto in the 19th century noticed that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned 
by 20% of the population. He then carried out surveys on other countries and found to his surprise that a similar 
23","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

The acceptance criteria of castings (prior to machining) are to be studied and further tightened to avoid these 
types of non-conformances observed post machining. The possibility of making these components by forge 
route instead of castings, 3D printing or following a refined casting method like investment casting also can be 
explored. Improved fixturing during heat treatment is to be employed to prevent undue distortion. 
 
6.5 Other factors 
The NCs due to deviation from fabrication process, visual non-conformances during fabrication and surface 
treatment related non-conformances are 6% each of the total non-conformances. Non-conformances like 
deviation in drill depth, bell mouth of drilled holes, etc. can be avoided by strictly adhering to the approved 
process for fabrication. Handling and transportation proceduresare to be reviewed, updated and implemented to 
avoid visual non-conformances. All assemblies for match machining, pre assembly and proof pressure testing 
are to be done in a clean room only. Scratch marks and peel off are mostly seen in aluminium components 
anodized by chromic acid process which can be replaced with thin layer sulphuric acid process having higher 
anodisation thickness and hardness. Most of the visual NCs are coming on the gasket seating area which 
occurred during the removal of gasket from the groove after proof pressure test or pre assembly. The possibility 
of making a special fixture for removing the gasket can be explored. Black patches are noticed after anodisation 
in some of the aluminium components. This effect is to be studied in detail and preventive measures are to be 
evolved. Weld related NCs like lack of fusion and pores are noticed particularly in aluminium alloy components 
like the propellant injector and POGO correctors. Fully machinedversion of POGO corrector and propellant 
injector can be used to avoid these non-conformances. Maintenance of cleanliness in the weld shop and cleaning 
of hardware just before welding is of utmost importance in reducing the pores in the final weld.  
 
7. Conclusion 
An average of forty two hardware non-conformances is reported during the fabrication of earth storable rocket 
engine. As a requirement of continuous improvement the number of non-conformances are to be reduced to 
improve the reliability of the engine. The non-conformances reported from industrial consortium during 
fabrication of 20 rocket engines are classified under 11 heads and Pareto analysis was carried out. Around 74% 
of the total non-conformances are due to 36% causes (4 nos.). 
 
After in-depth study of the existing processes and non-conformances observed, a total of twenty one numbers of 
improvements are suggested in sections 6.1 through 6.5 towards control of raw material, fixtures, welding, 
inspection, etc aimed at reducing the non-conformances, thereby improving the hardware quality. With these 
measures, number of NCs per engine can be brought down to less than 10 numbers.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on understanding the importance of implementing Industry 4.0 technology in the supply chain as 
many companies are still using traditional supply chains and are suffering from high costs, whereas there are 
companies that are either afraid to move towards Industry 4.0 or have no idea of how to proceed. The framework of 
this paper was created by reviewing the latest published articles. Furthermore, the paper explores the capability of 
industry 4.0 in attaining sustainability and highlights the need to have more research on the practical implementation 
of industry 4.0 in the supply chain for empirical understanding. By reviewing the latest published articles, it is true to 
say that industry 4.0 technology has a positive impact on the growth of the organisation. With the proper 
implementation of Industry 4.0 in the supply chain, attainment of such benefits is possible. After doing the systematic 
Analysis of the papers, individual benefits of industry 4.0 technologies can be identified, and it can be seen many of 
the organizations did try to implement Industry 4.0 technologies in order to attain more responsive outcome but didn’t 
succeed because of lack of efficient approach and understanding of the same. Organisations need to be proactively 
engaged in business and implement industry 4.0 technologies to attain economic, environmental, and social objectives. 
For implementing industry 4.0 in the supply chain, it is very important for organisations to have a proper roadmap 
defining the existing technologies, the number of suppliers for each product and its components, and future goals. As 
this will enable the managers to decide which technology, they need to have in their organisation to attain the desired 
goals. Also researchers need to focus on the practical implementation of various technologies in the supply chain in 
order to provide the strategic direction to the businesses, they need to dig deep to carry forward the researchers and 
provide empirical understanding on the application of industry 4.0 in supply chain.

Abstract 
This research compares the Combined Compromise Solution MCDM Method with some other known Multi-Criteria 
Decision-Making methods. We also propose an improved form with a new integration function based on a nonlinear

relative closeness coefficient for alternatives in the decision-making process. The possibilistic model proposed by Ye

Abstract 
Competition for companies that sell goods or services via e-commerce requires all companies to improve services to 
outrival in the competition. One aspect that has the potential to be a factor that makes a company superior is the 
payment method. Several choices of payment methods offered by e-commerce companies still provide opportunities 
for the discovery of new innovative payment methods that will facilitate e-commerce sales transactions. Companies 
that do not have good knowledge about the trend of e-payment methods and the development of e-payments in the 
future will lose in the competition. The aim of the research is to help e-commerce companies create a new, better 
payment method using Big Data. The research method uses a qualitative approach through observation and literature 
review to identify problems and investigations to find alternative solutions.

Abstract 
When it comes to improving logistic operations, the placement of a warehouse is generally one of the most important 
and strategic considerations. A single warehouse site will not be able to match the requirements of rapid delivery for 
customers distributed across a large area. As a result, the multi-COG model (multiple warehouse locations) is 
necessary. A warehouse's location is a long-term choice based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors. To 
account for a variety of considerations in warehouse selection, a two-stage strategy is provided. The first part of this 
work involves doing macro analysis for various warehouse locations using clustering methods, with the number of 
warehouses determined based on the Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS). In the second stage for phase-by-phase 
dissertation planning of warehouse are selected based on two Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, 
Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP), has been 
compared on five criteria: Warehouse cost per m2, Infrastructure access, Number of customers, Delivery time, 
Quantity of Sales. With over 650 delivery sites, four warehouses were chosen and a two-phase warehouse 
implementation strategy outlined.

1. Introduction
For the financial liquidity and the organization’s expenses may not want to have a lot of inventory on hand. However, 
there would be some gap in terms of logistic management, transportation range and management of travel. 
Transportation will take longer time and cost more if the distance is greater. To save more, significant inventories are 
required and a warehouse is required to store inventory. The location of a warehouse is an important consideration 
when developing a supply chain network for a business. The warehouse placement problem is significant in logistics 
since it pertains to determining the best location for logistical facilities. To service a large number of dealers, 
distributors, and customers, a warehouse is required to meet all of their demands. The fundamental purpose of 
warehouse placement is to be as close to the consumers as feasible, given the customers' needs for quick delivery and 
the increased competition to attract customers for Same Day delivery. A single warehouse will not be able to provide 
the major demand for express delivery in a very vast geographical region, hence many warehouses will be necessary 
to service clients at various places. When a single client is supplied by two warehouses located at very large distance, 
transportation costs rise because one warehouse is closer to the consumer and the other is farther away. As a result, a 
suitable network should be built to determine which customers will be supplied from which warehouse, lowering 
transportation costs and allowing for faster delivery. 
Zak and Weglinski (2014) proposed a two-stage technique for determining the most attractive warehouse site. The 
first step is to conduct a macro-analysis of the geographic regions in order to determine their overall potential and 
appropriateness for warehouse location. In the second step after macro analysis, micro-analysis is performed for 
individual warehouse locations in the specified areas. The selection and installation of a warehouse was a lengthy 
procedure that also need significant amount of capital expenditure. As a result, several criteria should be examined for 
phase-by-phase deployment of selected warehouses, ensuring that all criteria are taken into consideration.

that consumers could observe. This is because the Multi COG model helps to speed up delivery, which could lead to 
customer growth and increased market competition. 
6. Conclusion
In this study, we suggested a two-stage macro and micro analysis technique that incorporates both data-driven 
judgments and many criteria to evaluate; the core goal of quick delivery may also be reached using this methodology. 
K Means clustering and WCSS methods aid in mapping which customers should be serviced from which warehouse, 
resulting in faster delivery and lower transportation costs. In this process, not only sales locations are selected for 
analysis, but the weights of the quantity of product to be delivered are also attached, allowing warehouse locations to 
be set closer to the higher density of quantity sold and a shorter distance to be travelled.  
The applicability of the MCDM methodology was also demonstrated in the second stage of microanalysis, AHP and 
WASPAS methods were used for phase-wise implementation of warehouse site selection based on the warehouses 
identified in stage 1 of macro analysis. This stage has aided decision-makers to take an account for customer 
preferences in order to accomplish express delivery as soon as feasible when implementing the chosen warehouses. 
The further scope of research is possible in selecting the number of warehouses in terms of cost as well i.e., as supply 
chain consist of Primary transportation cost which is the cost needed to transport goods to warehouses, warehousing 
cost which is the, cost needed to run warehouse, a storing cost and capital expenditure needed to start warehouses and 
secondary transportation cost which is the cost to deliver to the customer.

Abstract 
Transportation plays an important role in supply chain management. To meet customer demands and reduce 
transportation costs, vehicle needs to be allocated to the optimal route. Vehicle allotment and route optimization are 
the critical factors for transportation service providers while providing best possible services. In this proposed model, 
optimization algorithm is developed to address the pain points of transport service providers, which will aid in making 
critical decisions. The algorithm uses the transactional data of the organization to calculate the loads to be transferred 
between two hubs/locations. Maximum load to be transferred, available vehicle type and its capacity are used as 
factors to determine the vehicle allotment. Simultaneously the algorithm allocates the vehicle to a route in such a way 
that the assigned vehicle is completely utilized. The algorithm is designed to consider cases with load availability less 
than the full capacity of allocated vehicle between two hubs by assigning touch points on the route in order to maximize 
the capacity utilization of the vehicle. By using this hub-to-hub optimization model, load factor of vehicle has 
improved. Operation efficiency has improved through this optimum model. The results of model calculation show that 
after using this model cost saving of 8% is calculated. Thus, this hub-to-hub model gives the best vehicle placement 
for available load at each hub in vehicle allotment and route optimization for transportation services.

1.Introduction
In today’s fast-moving world where cost has become one of the major factors to be controlled for a profitable business, 
Indian logistic business has witness exponential growth in these last years. Road transportation contributes more than 
50% of freight movement in India and has becoming an important sector in recent years. Rapid industrial development 
& increased trade has created pressure on the logistics industry to deliver at faster speeds.  
At the same time to reduce the transportation cost and meet customer satisfaction is big challenge for the companies 
as transportation costs accounts for approximately 36% of total logistics costs. Customer satisfaction can be defined 
by speed and convenience. Consumers want products to be delivered to their doorsteps in the short time. Thus time is 
a key factor which was highlighted even in a PwC’s consumer survey where 41% of consumers were ready to pay 
extra rates for fast deliveries. 
In this paper we address a real-life hub to hub movement problem faced by road transportation industries. Normally 
all the transportation companies have their own operation network where all their branches are set. All these industries 
generally work on three type of operation network that is hub and spoke operation network, hybrid hub and spoke 
operation network, direct transportation operation network. It is very difficult to make decision about which operation 
network to be selected. As in direct transportation operation network, all branches are connected with each other 
directly. This type of operation network is advantageous in short transport area where fast speed delivery is required. 
But when less than truck load transportation is there then there is high operation cost faced by the industries which 
can lead to loss in the business. To overcome these types of challenges, hub and spoke operation network are used. In 
this type of operation network, all the spokes are connected to the nearest hub and hub are connected to each other. 
Here, the loads are moved from spoke to nearest hub then from this hub to the nearest hub of the destination and then

Figure 3. As is and to be Load Factor comparison for return routes 
From the analysis of the load comparison in as is case and the to be case for transportation is shown in the figure 3. 
On time Delivery: While as-is analysis it was found that the load used to get stuck at a hub. The reason behind this 
is that the hub would not know that at what time the connecting load to other hub would be reaching at their hub and 
at some point, the vehicle used to be sent before the connecting load reach at the hub. this case has been solved in 
above tool as it considers the overall load that is booked load at that hub and incoming load while placing the load, 
due to which overall service level has increased. 
5. Conclusion
A real-life hub to hub problem related to the transportation of load from one location to another is done. The 
optimization hub to hub model is developed for assigning optimal vehicle to the routes. The results of data processing 
by using hub to hub optimization model we found that the total cost was minimized, and total time required to complete 
the delivery was close enough to its standard sets. This model help in reducing the total time of assigning the vehicle 
at each hub by centralizing the overall process. This model has tested and successfully implemented in the 
transportation company. By using this hub-to-hub optimization model, load factor of vehicle has improved. Operation 
efficiency has improved through this optimum model. The results of model calculation show that after using this 
model cost saving of 8% is calculated. Thus, this hub-to-hub model gives the best vehicle placement for available load 
at each hub in vehicle allotment and route optimization for transportation services.

Abstract 
Scheduling is one of the most important aspects for the efficient operation of any manufacturing industry. Scheduling 
deals with both time allocation as well as resource allocation to produce required quantity. Scheduling task in the 
polyvinyl chloride film manufacturing industry was not established any standardized process. This task was person 
dependent and produced required quantity without using optimum resources. The proposed model aims at automation 
of scheduling of slitting machines in polyvinyl chloride film manufacturing industry to minimize total processing time 
by using Integer Linear Programming Technique. Slitting is the process of cutting of bigger length and width of jumbo 
rolls to the smaller length and width of baby spools. Slitting machines handle a variety of materials, although each 
machine has its own constraints and capabilities. The proposed model is developed by using MS Excel VBA and 
Solver for optimum utilization of resources. This helps decision makers in planning and decision-making process of 
machine allocation.

1.Introduction
In this paper we address a real-life scheduling problem related to the production of Polyvinyl Chloride film 
manufacturing industry. PVC is a thermoplastic polymer which has been one of the most widely produced plastics. 
The production process of PVC film includes the main machine calender and some peripheral equipment such as super 
mixer, planetary extruder, mixing mill, cooling unit, b-ray thickness detector, and auto winder. It also includes PVDC 
coating machine and slitting machines. There are three calenders, one PVDC coating machine, 6 slitting machines and 
one rewinding machine in the considered PVC film manufacturing plant. In the production process, the materials 
supplying system provides PVC resin with a proper formula and color and produces different specifications of PVC 
film products through the calenders in the form of jumbo rolls. Then that jumbo roll is slitted into baby spools. The 
capacity of the PVC film production system is determined by the slitting machines which become the bottleneck in 
such a system. Slitting machine is a series of rollers used to slit a variety of materials, although one machine will not 
usually have the capabilities to slit all types of materials. All 6 machines have different capabilities and constraints. 
To fully utilize these machines, the objective of this research consists of effective scheduling as a useful tool to increase 
the Production Efficiency. 
The PVC film manufacturing plant receives purchase orders from different customers. Each purchase order contains 
a request to produce several PVC film products with five attributes: Formulation code, Color code, Outer diameter of 
spool, Film thickness, Width of spool. The document contains this all information about spool is called as Slitting 
Plan. 
Scheduling is a highly complicated process in any manufacturing industry. Doing it manually is time consuming and 
ineffective. Scheduling Optimization is allocating right resources to right places at right times. Factors influencing 
scheduling process are available resources, amount of work to be done, operating constraints. In this paper we focused 
mainly on the scheduling optimization of slitting machines in PVC film manufacturing industry. All slitting machines 
have different constraints and capabilities, scheduling was person dependent and decision makers were not following 
any standard process for machine allocation. So, optimum machine utilization was not there. To solve this issue basic 
55","After implementation of this scheduling optimization model, supervisor has the machine allocation at the starting of 
the shift. So, jumbo rolls and cores are available at the right time as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9. Due to this jumbo 
roll searching and core unavailability downtime reduced. Hence this model also reduces the downtime due to planning. 
This results in availability of all resources required for slitting at right time and at right place.  
5. Conclusion
A real-life scheduling problem related to the production of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) film manufacturing industry is 
considered. PVC is a thermoplastic polymer which has been one of the most widely produced plastics. The 
optimization scheduling model is developed for scheduling of six slitting machines. The results of data processing by 
using scheduling optimization model calculations indicates that the use of this model minimized the total time required 
to complete the production. It reduced the planning time from hours to minutes. This model has tested and successfully 
implemented in the industry. By using this scheduling optimization model, scheduling process became lean. 
Production Efficiency has improved through optimum utilization of six slitting machines. The results of model 
calculation show that after using this model production efficiency increased by approximately 10%. Thus, this 
scheduling model gives the better solution for available load in the considered PVC film manufacturing industry.

Abstract 
The pandemic has an impact on all aspects of human life and activities, including learning activities. Student learning 
activities that should be carried out at school are forced to be done online because of regulations that limit activities 
outside the home which require students and teachers to carry out online learning activities. On the other hand, today's 
students are Generation Z who have unique characteristics that require different learning patterns from the previous 
generation so that online learning methods are needed that suit their needs. Adaptive learning is a teaching and learning 
process that is made according to the needs of students through appropriate learning resources and quick feedback and 
direction between teachers and students. The purpose of this research is to build an adaptive learning model to support 
the learning process of students and teachers during a pandemic. The research method uses a qualitative approach 
through literature study and observation to find out the unique character of Generation Z and relate it to their learning 
needs. Literature review is also used to identify alternative solutions so that the learning process for Generation Z in 
the pandemic era can run effectively.

Abstract 
The relationship between higher education as a provider of labour services from graduates has a strong relationship 
with industry as an institution that uses labour services from graduates of higher education. Track records of student 
academic achievements are stored either in higher education or when students or prospective employees/employees 
have certificates of expertise/professionalism, work experience letters are only stored in the company and there is no 
integrated system that stores these track records while the industry is a user of labour services. Employers really need 
valid information about prospective employees who will work in their company. Therefore, a system that integrates 
universities, students/prospective employees, employees, and industry is needed. On the other hand, blockchain is a 
technology that offers a high level of security and several other advantages that can be used to build an integrated 
system. This research aims to build an employee tracking system model that integrates higher education, prospective 
workers/students, workers, and industry in a single system based on block chain technology. The research method 
uses a qualitative approach through literature studies and observations to find problems and alternative solutions..

Abstract 
Ergonomics is the science and technology of fitting the activities and environment to the abilities, dimensions, and 
needs of people to improve performance while enhancing comfort, health and safety. Anthropometry is the branch of 
ergonomics that deals with body shape and size. Workstations in small scale industries are designed in an arbitrary 
manner, and no consideration is given to the anthropometric measurements of the operator. The present study is 
designed to focus on mismatch between operator measurements and physical characteristics and work station design 
to find out any mismatch between them. Some case studies of workstations in typical small-scale industries like food 
products, grinding mills, garment industry and bolt manufacturing units are taken for study. The workstations are 
studied to find out ergonomic deficiencies and mismatch between the user and workstation design. Rapid Upper Limb 
Analysis (RULA) is done on the awkward posture adapted by operators while doing work. The ergonomic deficiencies 
are highlighted and the improved workstations are designed and built in CATIA software. RULA analysis is carried 
out on the improved workstation using human manikin built in CATIA. The results show the RULA risk levels are 
considerably reduced (from high-risk category to medium or low risk category). It can be concluded from the present 
studies that small scale industries lack awareness and application of ergonomics and anthropometry principles in the 
design of work stations, thus compelling the operators to work in difficult postures, poorly designed workplaces and 
work environment.

Abstract 
The application of AI has switched the dimension of the construction industry. In upgrading the several aspects of the 
construction, AI has made it easier and possible by automatic data collection and analysis. In this paper, two sensors 
are used (i.e motion sensor and RFID). The motion sensor will automatically detect the human and animal within its 
range of danger zone. It contains a pyroelectric sensor that will notice the movements human and animals within its 
range. This sensor works by noticing the heat energy in the form of an infra-red signal. Further, this paper deals with 
the application of AI in construction sites. Similarly, the paper gives some focus on RFID use in the safety of 
construction. RFID deals with personal warning systems, real-time tracking, and location. Finally, the outcome of the 
developed platform figure-out that it is feasible to be applied in construction sites for better safety management.

1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) can be explained as the capability of any machine to impersonate the human behavior of 
learning, growing and gaining knowledge/experience. AI can also be represented as an expert system that can know 
and construct intelligent entities and make a methodology that is quick, simple and efficient in decision making. The 
automation of cognitive computing is something that AI is concerned with which acts and thinks like humans. It is 
widespread and deeply rooted into our daily lives. It supports interactions of multiple disciplines like cybernetics, 
computing, neurophysiology, scientific theory and psychology. AI is engaged with designing, research and application 
of our time-efficient projects. It cooperates with machines designed to perform functions specialized to work 
intelligently when performed by humans. The AI concept may be already entangled in our day to day lives but its 
main aim is to explore different ways to mimic and execute various intelligent functions of a human brain in such a 
way that people emerge with technical products and create relevant theories.  Almost every industry is influenced by 
technology today and hence the design and construction fields have also begun to cope up with advancements. Today, 
it won't be any surprise for anyone to fly a drone, to have an eye on a project before completion over a construction 
site with a computer game or to decide simplest of settings from supported predictions given by AI. Belief networks 
or Bayesian networks are a type of AI that deals with uncertainty using applied mathematics and conditional 
dependencies. For the creation of development operations, an automated approach that involves a blend of assumption 
networks and simulation is explained by AI and for the development operations to perform analysis, these assumption 
networks provide diagnostic functionality in this application.  To create these development operations and validate 
them, computer simulations and assumption network recommendations are employed.

After power switch is on, about 20-60 seconds is required for sensor in order to function properly (Figure 6). The 
relay will activate the lamp/alarm when object is detected within sensor range. After the adjusted delay time is over, 
the lamp/alarm will turn-off. 
 
6. Result and Discussion 
The prototype developed above is ready to serve in the construction sites. Each year fatality in construction sites is 
growing. Many workers lose their lives in the sites due to improper safety systems. In such a scenario, when the 
concept of this developed prototype is used, it will be beneficial to the construction project as well as people working 
on the sites. A good mange system of safety encourages the worker to work freely in the sites that will ultimately 
benefit the project completion. Furthermore, an RFID tag with each worker will make them safe from hazardous 
locations and help the site supervisor to locate the reallocation of the worker. The buzz or alarming system will restrict 
the worker from going from those hazardous locations. Thus, we can say the site will be safer to work on once the 
developed prototype and application of artificial intelligence are taken into account before carrying out the project. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The growth of the construction industry now depends upon the use of new technologies. With the use of new 
technologies, the construction sector will achieve proper and continuous growth along with other sectors in this 
modern-changing world. AI has shown its potency to perform better than conventional methods. The use of smart 
sensors will easily overcome the safety risk and issues. Construction sites have challenging environments to manage 
with many critical issues in asset management, tools tracking, production safety, as well as worker safety AI-based 
sensors, which have proved to be a boon for this industry.  
Physical assets and workers are easily monitored on the sites and can be managed well with consideration of RFID 
active tags. Keeping in mind with those risk and hazardous area in the construction sites, Motion sensors and RFID 
active tags will keep all the safety of the workers to prevent them from going to those restricted areas producing 
alarm or turning on the red lights. 
 
With keeping in mind to provide better safety on the sites, this project or dissertation work aims at developing a 
sensor-based platform. This platform will help the construction workers and other staff members to be safe on the 
site so that construction projects go on smoothly. This will provide workers’ information and location in real-time 
which help to maintain traceability and monitoring of workers on the site.  Further, in this research or dissertation 
work, a prototype of the motion sensor has been developed. We can say without a doubt that AI has the capacity to 
vary the entire discipline, by providing it with new possibilities and ways to explore.

Abstract  
 
The fundamental goal of this article, which investigates the working circumstances of technical personnel at a power 
distribution company, is to determine the level of danger they face when working in various conditions. The multi-
grade fuzzy technique was used in this investigation. The assessment will assist the distribution company in 
determining the level of risk that their technical personnel face, identifying strong and weak traits, and making 
appropriate improvement recommendations. The final risk index is calculated as 7.01, which indicates that the risk 
level of the case electric power distribution company is “High Risk”. The study was further extended to identify the 
weaker attributes using Importance Performance Analysis (IPA). Medical support provided by the organization and 
financial aid to the employees in case of an accident are considered weaker attributes of the case power distribution 
company. The results of the study would help the managers of the company to analyze the current risk level of the 
company and to focus on their weaker attributes to make necessary improvements in the working pattern and 
implement new innovative methods that help to reduce the risk level of workers and provide them with a safer 
environment.

1. Introduction  
Power distribution can be defined as the final stage of delivery of power from the transmission system to individual 
customers. Due to various aspects relating to the operations of a power distribution company, the risks that may cause 
injuries to the technical staff are also high. The study tries to identify various attributes that might cause risk to the 
technical staff while they are engaged in certain activities to ensure proper power supply to the consumers. The level 
of risk is higher in the distribution of electrical energy when compared with the distribution of other types of power. 
 
Even though there are many studies that have been done on the topic of workplace safety in power distribution, the 
number of studies on electrical workplace risk is comparatively lower. This was the primary motivation for conducting 
the study and determining the areas where workers' electrical safety is jeopardized. The uniqueness of this study is the 
use of a multi-grade fuzzy approach in the calculation of the risk index of the distribution company and to provide 
them with recommendations for improving the workplace safety of technical staff. The framework also addresses the 
following questions: 
 
RQ1: How can the risk level of a DISCOM's technical team be assessed? 
RQ2: What are the enablers, criteria and attributes that influence the risk level of technical staff? 
RQ3: How are the weaker attributes addressed to reduce the risk level of technical staff of case DISCOM unit? 
 
The purpose of the study was to provide answers to the above-mentioned questions as well as to assist the case firm 
in identifying areas where they have limits and improving worker safety procedures in order to reduce the incidence 
86","Figure 1. The percentage of number of factors in each quadrant. 
 
If the case company focuses on the above weaker attribute so that they can reduce the risk level of their operations. 
Figure 1 represents the percentage of number of factors in each quadrant. The attributes in this quadrant II needed 
more attention to be given by the case division of power distribution company managers to reduce the risk level of 
their operations. 
 
6. Practical Implication 
The study has identified about 32 attributes and they have been classified under 5 different enablers. This type of 
classification has made it easier to analyze various factors which are contributing to increased risk levels in the 
working atmosphere of staff in the case distribution company. Workplace safety is an important factor that affects the 
efficient working of an organization. So, it is the responsibility of the top-level management to ensure that the workers 
are provided with all the facilities to work safely and that they are in a mental condition to work properly. With the 
help of IPA, the study has identified several weak attributes. It is identified that “reporting of incidents by the 
authorities, providing proper safety equipment to employees on time, and quality of equipment provided to 
employees” are the weaker attributes that contribute to the “high level” of risk existing now in the case distribution 
company. The management can analyze the various aspects to improve workplace safety and can concentrate more on 
these weaker attributes so that the risk level of the employees will reach a point where the risk is negligible. A 
continuous assessment needed to be done to maintain the level of safety and to improve.  
 
7. Conclusion  
Power distribution is an integral part of modern society and its use and application will be increasing in the near future. 
This is also a field that has workplace risks that lead to many accidents that cause casualties and injuries. The proposed 
study would help the top-level management of the distribution company to analyze their position in providing safety 
to workers and identify those fields in which they are lacking proper attention and need improvement. The study uses 
an approach named the multi-grade fuzzy approach and the case study was conducted at ABC Distribution Company. 
It has been found that the risk level of the firm comes under the category of “High Risk”. The study also included an 
IPA which helps to identify the weaker attributes of the firm.

Abstract 
Emerging Markets Developing Economies (EMDE) rely on sovereign external debt to meet their financial needs and 
to enhance the economic growth. However, a high level of external indebtedness and its mismanagement can harm 
the economic performance, which outlines the importance of the objective of any operation of fund raising. These 
countries tend to accumulate significant levels of debts. This paper investigates the factors contributing in debt 
accumulation in case of Morocco, which is an emerging economy, using annual data over the last two decades. A 
certain determinants of external debt buildup identified by the literature are examined using ARDL approach to co-
integration. The findings affirm the relationship between the level of external debt and the explanatory variables 
both in long and short run. Nevertheless, the nexuses are statistically insignificant. The Granger causality test that 
was conducted on the model variables reveals a bidirectional cause between external debt and exchange rate. 
Furthermore, the regulatory quality is the only variable among institutional variables which is caused by foreign 
borrowing.

1. Introduction
Public Financial Management (PFM) refers to a set of rules, policies and procedures governing public sector’s 
resources and expenditures, covering the central government and sub-sovereign governments besides state-owned 
enterprises and Public-Private Partnerships (PPP). PFM is the determinant of public service quality since it affects 
the utilization of all national resources. Parry (2010) suggests four objectives (dimensions) of PFM, considering it as 
an information system providing both ex-ante and ex-post data. The first dimension is aggregate fiscal management 
aiming the fiscal sustainability, maximizing resource mobilization and its allocation in accordance with policy 
priorities. The second dimension is operational management. This dimension entails effective performance 
management, delivering value for money besides managing within the budget. The third objective is the fiduciary 
risk management, considering the contribution of PFM in managing the risk through an effective financial control, 
conformity with legal and regulatory requirements and auditing the reports. Governance is the fourth dimension. 
According to the author, this objective is based on two fundamentals namely, financial information’s transparency 
and accountability. ACCA (2010) outlines that good public financial governance enhances economic growth, 
improves the effectiveness and the efficiency of national resources management decisions and rises the general 
public’s trust in public sector.  
Enhancing the country’s development and quality of public service is a common challenge of all governments 
worldwide as every public decision must be simultaneously efficient, effective and frame perfectly with the 
economic and social trend. Thus, governments tend to adjust their public financial management frequently following 
the innovations in the international and national environment. In Morocco, the Public Financial management is 
governed by an organic law (loi organique relative à loi de finances). This law has gone through several reforms 
under the influence exerted by the mutations and changes in the political, economic and social context. In 2001,

6. Conclusion
This paper investigates the factors contributing in public external debt buildup in case of Morocco from 2000 to 
2020. The study utilized the ARDL bounds test approach to co-integration. The results reveal that public external 
debt accumulation in Morocco is determined in long run by domestic savings, exchange rate, public expenses, debt 
service, current account balances, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and voice and 
accountability. The empirical results show that debt service, exchange rate, expenses, governance effectiveness and 
regulatory quality have an insignificant and positive impact on external debt buildup in long run. The insignificant 
and negative effect is depicted in the relationships of debt surge with savings, current account balances, voice and 
accountability and rule of law in the long term. These findings suggest that the sovereign external debt is maintained 
at low levels and government’s policies do not rely mainly on external debt, which can prevent the economy from 
the vulnerabilities associated to international fund raising. This study is limited to the interaction between 
government policies and external debt accumulation, without assessing the impact of financing the public sector 
through overseas borrowing and its costs on the Moroccan economic performance which can be investigated in 
another study.

Abstract 
An employee engagement assessment is implemented in many software development projects to access cognitive 
engagement and overall employee satisfaction. This paper develops the assessment framework for employee 
engagement levels in Software Development Projects (SDP) using the multi-grade fuzzy approach. The case study 
has been conducted and the results found that the employee engagement index of case SDP organization is 7.11, which 
indicates that the ‘moderately engaged’. An Importance Performance Analysis is used to identify the weaker attributes. 
This framework will help SDP organization’s managers to measure the employee engagement and give more 
importance to the weaker attributes to boost their engagement level.

1. Introduction
A software development project is a multi-person effort where the codes are generated and improved to add significant 
value to the current or new business process while staying within the constraints of time, budget, and personnel 
resources. These initiatives must meet certain criteria, including the ability to offer considerable business value and 
the fact that they are not minor enterprises. High visibility, moderate to high complexity, and urgency in requirements 
will be the factors of these development projects that add significant value to the businesses. Software engineers 
typically employ engineering concepts to design software and systems in order to solve problems. They usually aim 
to solve an issue or bring in a solution for everyone, rather than for a specific person, customer, or situation. To bring 
in these changes and answers, they use modeling languages and tools. The solutions they propose are for real-world 
problems that can be solved in real-time, such as an elevator or a bridge. 
The amount of enthusiasm and engagement an employee shows towards the work is described as employee 
engagement, which is a concept under human resources. The more the employees are engaged, the more they care 
about their work and how to improve the performance of the organization and will understand that their efforts count. 
Some smaller organizations are unaware of the concepts of employee engagement assessment. Productivity and 
efficiency improve upon the effective implementation of employee engagement assessment practices. In 
organizations, the effectiveness of the employee engagement assessment depends on specific employee engagement 
attributes that are identified and evaluated. This paper focuses on developing a framework for calculating employee 
engagement levels in the organization and provides suggestions to improve weaker attributes.  
The study aims to answer the below Research Question (RQ)s: 
RQ1: How can employee engagement be measured in software development projects?   
RQ2: What are the enablers, criteria, and attributes that influence engagement of employees in software development 
projects?  
RQ3: How can weaker attributes be addressed to enhance employee engagement in software development projects? 
2. Literature Review
In management performance and practice, employee engagement is a critical factor. And there is no definite standard 
for evaluating employee engagement. Sun and Bunchapattanasakda (2019) examines and derives from prior employee 
engagement research findings. Here, employee engagement is defined as a combination of both multi-faceted

their present jobs' functional experience and, through continuous training and education in their specific sector, assist 
people in upgrading their skills and knowledge.  
 
7. Conclusion  
This study mainly focuses on employee engagement in the case organization. The level of enthusiasm and involvement 
the employee has towards his/her work is called employee engagement. The employee engagement assessment is 
constructed by using a multi-grade fuzzy approach, and IPA is used to identify the weak attributes. In order to improve 
weaker attributes and to gain a competitive advantage, suggestions are provided as well. This study categorizes the 
case-SDP organization as “moderately engaged” but there are chances to achieve the “extremely engaged” category 
level. The assessment framework can be further explored by incorporating additional employee engagement attributes 
specific to the project's location and work environment.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to develop assessment framework for customer loyalty in quick-service restaurants. 
Building customer loyalty is a key factor in influencing repeat purchases in the designated restaurant. This framework 
used multi-grade fuzzy for assessment and importance performance analysis is used to identify the weaker attributes 
that need to be improved. The case study has been conducted in a quick-service restaurant. Based on the case-analysis 
promised and on-time service, attentive staff, and a range of foods are weaker attributes. This framework enables 
restaurant managers to identify and improve customer satisfaction, which will have a direct influence on customer 
loyalty. 
Keywords 
Customer loyalty, Quick service restaurant, Perceived value, Responsiveness, Importance Performance Analysis 
1. Introduction
Due to the change in consumers’ lifestyles and technological advancements, customers are likely to prefer quick-
service restaurants in day-to-day life. In quick-service restaurants, making customers loyal to our restaurant will be an 
ultimate goal (Uddin, 2019) to get a regular business. We could see that customer satisfaction will be a direct result 
of the service they provide (Vasumathi and Subashini, 2015). We can say that, in other ways, customer satisfaction 
will lead to customer loyalty. Nowadays fast-food restaurants are looking for ways to improve the loyalty of their 
customers. Based on the responses from a similar company, we have rated the weightage of each attribute that we 
have mentioned. Consumers will also look for a different value in the service that the quick-service restaurant will 
provide. Even though there might be a lot of research papers in assessing customer satisfaction, we have identified a 
gap that there is a limited number of papers published in quick-service restaurants or fast-food restaurants and not 
many of them opted to use the multi-grade fuzzy approach for analyzing customer loyalty. This gap helps to create 
this model to analyze the case. The following research questions will be assessed in this paper: 
RQ1: How can we measure customer loyalty in a quick-service restaurant? 
RQ2: What are all the enablers, criteria, and attributes that influence customer loyalty in a quick-service restaurant? 
RQ3: How are weaker attributes addressed to enhance the service quality level that leads to customer loyalty for quick-
service restaurants? 
2. Literature Review
Customer loyalty in quick-service restaurants has been described as the customer’s perception of the purchase and the 
behavior intention that influences the greater level of satisfaction (Uddin, 2019). In the restaurant industry, several 
factors need to be considered. These include customer satisfaction, the quality of food they are provided, the ambiance 
of the restaurant, the reliability of the service they are providing, and many more factors. According to Uddin (2019), 
there is no single definition for customer satisfaction; it includes many factors combined to produce an end as a 
satisfied customer. Dimensions such as servqual (Parasuraman et al., 1988) are used to test the level in the service 
industry. In restaurants, increasing the perceived value of customers will provide a pleasant experience for them, which 
results in customer satisfaction. This increased satisfaction will increase customer loyalty (Uddin, 2019) towards the 
particular industry. In our case, it is fast-food restaurants.  
Customer loyalty is directly dependent upon the behavior of the customer and their attitude towards the product 
(Kandampully and Suhartanto, 2000). Behavior in terms relate to the frequency of dining in a particular restaurant and

Figure 1 shows the graphical representation of IPA. 11% of the factors in quadrant I need concentration and the 
management should take appropriate actions to improve it. 
 
6. Practical Implication 
This study has provided some practical implications for quick-service restaurants in terms of increasing customer 
loyalty and satisfaction. There might be a few variations in the attributes, but some of the important dimensions must 
be the same for all quick service restaurants. Some of the dimensions can vary depending on the geographic location, 
culture, and values. From the management's point of view, they need to concentrate more on the weaker attributes to 
improve customer loyalty. 
 
7. Conclusion  
The given research has assessed customer loyalty in quick-service restaurants. Our desired objective of this paper is 
to assess the criteria by evaluating the opinions of the experts. The above research would help many quick-service 
restaurant managers and management to implement it across their restaurants. And the IPA analysis will help the 
restaurants concentrate more on the attributes that are weaker and need more concentration. Even though this study 
analyzed customer loyalty, there will be some limitations to this, such as it may vary based on the geographic location 
and cultural aspects. We cannot be able to generalize across all customers who are all living in different countries.

Abstract 
This study analyzed consumers’ choice of hospitals or Level of Care (LoC) as it is called by the National Sample 
Survey Office (NSSO). The Government of India has been conducting Health surveys and the 75th survey is the recent 
data on the usage of healthcare across India. The data comprises of all the states and Union Territories. The 
hospitalization data of the survey contains the consumer inputs on why they do not choose Government or Public 
Hospitals (GH). It also contains the prior and first subsequent hospitalization inputs. Using this, a Pareto analysis was 
conducted to know the reasons consumers state for not using GH. Also, the previous experience of the consumers and 
the subsequent choice have been arrived using a Decision Tree. This study has consolidated the reasons for the choice 
of LoC and this has subsequently helped to arrive at a tentative model that can be analyzed in further research. The 
objective of this study is to understand the challenges and consumer perceptions to assist in evolving healthcare in 
India. This is conducted at a time when India is transforming its healthcare mission amid a very intense combat of the 
COVID-19. The Prime Minister of India has also announced in the 74th Independence Day speech on the 15th of 
August 2020 about the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) making it very apt to look at the past, present and 
future of Indian Healthcare.

1. Introduction
Nearly 63 million people of India are in debt due to health care expenses and a third of the population is driven below 
poverty line due to the same (Source: https://www.governancenow.com/news/regular-story/63-million-indians-are-
in-debt-due-healthcare-expenditure-report). It is a very ambitious goal to think of finding a solution to this issue in 
one research paper. However, this paper serves to give a good introduction to the literature review, existing landscape, 
the stakeholders, and the status. There is a wide and deep research that has happened in various geographies across 
various segments of insurance. Section 1 reviews the literature from the prior research and narrows down the scheme 
and impacting factor that will be focused on. Section 2 explains the healthcare and health insurance in India. Section 
3 elaborates on the NSSO data and focuses on an analysis on the reasons consumers do not choose Government or 
Public hospitals.  Section 3 plunges into a Decision Tree with the voluminous data to suggest how the choice of the 
LoC is calculated. Section 4 proposes a model how these come together, and a final section suggests the possibilities 
for further research. 
1.1 Objectives 
Good health leads to happiness for individuals (Angner et al, 2010) and economic growth for a nation  (Smith, 2012). 
Many times, good health is not available or affordable to everyone. While nations strive to make universal healthcare 
possible, there are still wide gaps to make it accessible for everyone. This situation is very similar in developed 
economies as well of developing economies. While there are pockets of success in certain South Asian nations, India 
is still way behind in its journey (Sen and Lamont, 2015). India ranks almost in the last quartile among sovereign 
countries in terms of quality and accessibility of healthcare (145th among 195 countries). Affordability is the key to 
accessibility. Affordability is not simple to implement; it requires creative, out-of-the-box thinking. To deliver 
affordability, we require innovation—innovation in discovering drugs, developing therapeutics and delivering 
healthcare (Mazumdar-Shaw, 2018). To make healthcare available for everyone, it is very important to get the public, 
private and Charitable / Trust / NGO led hospitals (CT) to be on par with the healthcare delivery. Many people in 
123","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

While analyzing the choice of hospital, we looked into the various choices available for people based on their prior 
hospitalization experience (Figure 3). The choices they made in the past could be as follows: 
a. 
First time Hospitalization / No Prior Hospitalization (NH) 
b. Govt/Public Hospital (GH) 
c. 
Charitable/Trust/NGO (CT) 
d. Private Hospital (PH) 
e. 
Private Doctor /Clinic (PC) 
f. 
Informal HealthCare Provider (IHC)  
 
The probabilities of the choice as calculated in Table 3 is used. The next step is the current choice of the hospital. As 
the current choice is analyzed for GH, CT and PH, the decision tree is created for these combinations from the first 
choice of the hospital.  
 
For Example: In No Prior Hospitalization (NH), the choices of GH, CT and PH score 0.54, 0.02, 0.44 respectively.  
These calculations from Table 3 were used to build the decision tree. 
 
Now, for understanding the probability of someone choosing the GH, the various combinations of someone choosing 
the GH are summed up. 
In this case, the prior hospitalization choices could have been any of the six choices, namely, NH, GH, CT, PH, PC, 
HC and the current choice is GH. The probabilitis of these six combinations are summed up as follows: 
 
A decision tree was created to evaluate the probability of someone choosing a GH. It is calculated as 
(0.34 X 0.54) + (0.31 X 0.85) + (0.01 X 0.19) + (0.21 X 0.10) + (0.12 X 0.34) + (0.01 X 0.61) 
= 0.1836 + 0.2635 + 0.0019 + 0.021 + 0.0408 + 0.0061 
= 0.5169 0r 51.69% 
 
5.1 Proposed Improvements 
This model could also be further elaborated and analyzed for the following hypotheses. 
• 
Earlier Experience (Hospital1) impacts the current choice of Hospital (Hospital2). 
• 
Earlier Experience (Hospital1) and the Reason explain the choice of Hospital2. 
• 
DoS1 moderates the relationship between Hospital1 and Hospital2. 
• 
Hospital2 impacts the choice of Hospital3. 
• 
DoS1 moderates the relationship between Hospital1 and Hospital2. 
 
5.2 Validation 
Addressing these top four reasons will help consumers choose more Government and Public hospitals. As the research 
evolves, there would be a greater clarity to identify more variables, mediators and modifiers and arrive at an equation 
that can best describe the proposed system. That would constitute the basic research. The aim of this research is to be 
applied research and more work in needed in establishing the networks, identifying the important stakeholders, decision 
makers and socializing the research idea and getting the appropriate support. In successful research, this would pave 
the way either through shared contracts or not for the appropriate mechanism that would increase the availability and 
accessibility of GSHIS. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper is not an end-to-end paper for achieving health insurance for everyone. However, it has identified a major 
source of data and the analysis has yielded a direction for further research in arriving at the service design for healthcare 
in India. This analysis is very helpful to assess the Level of Care (LoC) and the decisions people make regarding their 
healthcare choices. This study is envisaged to help address the areas of improvement to elevate the quality of service 
in healthcare in India.

Abstract 
The most life-threatening infectious disease the world has been fighting is SARS–CoV–2. The outbreak of this virus 
has affected so many day–to–day activities of people and businesses. Almost all businesses in India have been 
impacted by the lockdown and restrictions on connectivity to cities and towns. Moreover, many operations of the 
business have faced adverse consequences, which have led to the closure of a few businesses. One of the industries 
that was affected during the COVID outbreak was the blood bank. This study aims to assess the level of risk in the 
blood bank operations during COVID–19. The enablers, criteria, and attributes that facilitate the risk in blood bank 
operations were identified and evaluated using the multi-grade fizzy technique. The results stated that low risk was 
observed in the blood bank operation during COVID-19 and also that stayed the same during the emergence of any 
other infectious diseases. The final risk index average is 4.49, which confirms that it is low risk. An important 
performance analysis was performed to identify the attributes that contribute to higher risk in blood bank operations.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak has drastically affected many countries and also many industries. The day-to-day activities 
of many industries have also been affected because of the changes in the supply chain. One of the industries that has 
been affected and is crucial to handling any health emergency is the blood bank services. Blood bank services are one 
of the essential services in health emergencies. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak and restrictions on transportation 
during the outbreak, blood bank services have been affected (Arcot et al., 2020). This infectious disease has imposed 
a higher risk on blood bank operations. Risk can be anything related to operational, clinical, or safety aspects of the 
services and also the people involved in delivering those services. This research aims to find out the factors that 
affected the risk level in blood bank services during the COVID-19 outbreak and also to find out which factors may 
have the same effect in the future in any such explosion of infectious diseases. 
Risk assessment in the blood bank is so crucial because blood is an important component when it comes to saving 
lives. Handling blood carefully is essential. The SARS CoV–2 virus is one of the diseases that can be identified 
through blood testing. Hence, we discuss the potential challenges faced by blood banks that increase the risk level in 
blood bank operations, such as inventory balancing, smooth service operations, and blood bank safety. 
The objective of this research is to answer the following three research questions: 
•
How can the risk level be assessed in blood bank operations during emerging infectious diseases like
COVID-19?
•
What are the enablers, criteria, and attributes that influence the level of risk in blood bank operations?
•
What are the weaker and stronger attributes that contribute to the risk level in blood bank operations and
how can they be addressed?

Figure 1 represents the percentage of number of factors in each quadrant. Case-blood bank managers must pay close 
attention to the attributes in the quadrant II to reduce the risk level of their operations. 
6. Practical implication 
The risk level in the blood banks has been assessed with 17 attributes, 6 criteria, and 3 enablers using the multi-grade 
fizzy approach. The weaker and stronger attributes have been identified using importance performance analysis. The 
IPA will help us identify which attributes are contributing to more risk and which attributes are at an appropriate level 
to maintain the risk level in the organizations. This risk level analysis of the attributes will help the organizations to 
assess their current risk level and identify which attributes are contributing to the risk so that they can take measures 
to control them and bring them to the baseline. This analysis can be applied to any infectious outbreak and not only 
to the COVID–19 era. With the help of these 17 attributes, most of the risk levels in the blood banks can be measured 
and controlled. 
7. Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to identify the factors influencing the risk level of blood bank operations during 
emerging infectious diseases such as COVID–19. The 17 attributes, 6 criteria, and 3 enablers were identified, and 
they are ranked on a scale of 1–10. The data was collected through personal interviews, and the data was analyzed 
using multi-grade fuzzy. Furthermore, an IPA was carried out to find out the riskier  and less risky attributes. Through 
IPA, the riskier attributes were found to be testing for infectious diseases, blood donation after vaccination, following 
safety protocols, exposure to infected patients, and educating and training on how to handle infected patients. The 
possible suggestions have been provided to reduce risk rate. These results will help all the hospitals, blood banks, and 
any other institutions involved in blood transfusion services to be prepared for outbreak of infectious diseases like 
Covid-19 and will help to handle such situations wisely with available information.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to identify patient satisfaction attributes that will impact patient ratings in hospitals. 
This study demonstrates how to identify and assess the most essential and weakest attributes to increase total 
customer satisfaction with treatment methods, staff behavior, and the general ambiance of the healthcare center. 
Using extensive literature reviews and expert opinions, four enablers, nine criteria, and thirty-four attributes were 
identified to be analyzed and addressed. The calculated overall satisfaction index was 7.04, within a range of 7-
8, representing ‘highly satisfied’. This result implies that the case hospitals have placed sufficient emphasis on 
customer satisfaction attributes. The results also helped identify the strongest and weakest attributes through 
importance-performance analysis and provided suggestions for improvement on the weaker attributes. This 
research will assist healthcare managers in identifying areas of focus and factors of improvement that would 
considerably increase the efficacy and efficiency of the flow of processes in hospitals. Maintaining the quality of 
services at medical institutions around the world is a major concern in the healthcare business. Hence, this paper 
will cover all possible patient service expectations and aid healthcare organizations in effectively adopting quality 
control measures.

1. Introduction
Healthcare is one of the largest sectors in India in terms of revenue and employment. The industry has also been 
growing at a compound annual growth rate of 22% since 2016. For such a large industry, patients are the 
cornerstones of the success or failure of healthcare improvements and innovations. Their satisfaction with 
facilities and service is what drives improvement in efficiency and innovations in the industry. Understanding 
patient needs and preferences, identifying their requirements and problems, and addressing them is the main 
source of resource usage in a healthcare institution. For this to be effective, it is imperative that the patient journey 
map of each patient be framed and closely monitored. Through this, all further strategies for the improvement of 
services can be tracked, and the effects of the changes made can be identified and rated for effectiveness. Ensuring 
that these facilities are updated with the latest and most sophisticated technology is what will drive the healthcare 
sector to provide better and more effective treatment for its patients. Ensuring patient satisfaction has become the 
main focus of all healthcare centers in the past few years. Using patient feedback as a guide, it is imperative that 
healthcare institutions incorporate the changes in their services and functions to ensure maximum patient 
satisfaction and overall positive ratings, as well as identify areas of lacunae and address them as effectively as 
possible. 
2. Literature Review
Al-Abri and Al-Balushi (2014) performed a study on how patient satisfaction is addressed in healthcare 
organizations and what measures are taken to help improve the quality of all relevant dependent and independent 
influential attributes that contribute to overall patient satisfaction. Demographic factors like gender, age, and 
education did not influence satisfaction as adversely as previously assumed. Their health status played a much 
larger role in their satisfaction with healthcare services. The results of this paper were that the behavior of medical 
staff, such as nurses, in terms of courtesy, respect, and patience was an important factor in the overall satisfaction

Figure 1 represents the percentage of number of factors in each quadrant. The attributes in the quadrant I need to 
be paid attention to by the case-hospital managers to increase the patient satisfaction level of their operations. 
6. Practical Implication
The practical implications of the study majorly depend on how patient feedback is collected, considered, and 
analyzed. Using the analyzed information in the form of quality improvements in terms of performance and 
quality of service is the ideal situation. Several research papers cover the necessity for patient satisfaction 
feedback and how it can benefit the improvement of the quality of healthcare across the world. But there are very 
few recorded instances of the feedback being implemented in the form of quality control measures. This is mainly 
due to the fact that patient satisfaction is a very difficult aspect of the medical care service industry to gauge as 
it is highly subjective and all patients have their own standards. This study can help by identifying commonalities 
and relations among all the attributes generally involved in discerning satisfaction levels. Medical management 
teams can use this information to help identify areas of focus and factors of improvement that would greatly 
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the flow of processes in healthcare centers. 
7. Conclusion
A major issue in the healthcare sector is maintaining the quality of services in medical institutions all over the 
world. This paper will be one of many such studies which document all possible expectations from patients in 
terms of service and help healthcare institutions implement quality control measures effectively. This research 
framework will assist healthcare managers to find patient satisfaction level in their hospital and identifying on 
weaker attributes of the flow of processes in their hospital.

Abstract 
Nowadays parking of a car has become a great issue in these metropolitan cities. Smart parking systems, when 
implemented correctly, can significantly alleviate many of the difficulties associated with traffic congestion in urban 
areas. Many modern parking systems will have a fundamental section of Empty Parking Slot Detection. This paper 
mainly concentrates on smart parking system based on image processing which is developed for open parking plots 
and many more. It is proposed as an acquisition to new evolving technology by using python programming and 
OpenCV tools library such as HAAR Classifier. Using edge detention and coordinate constrained pixel portions, it is 
possible to detect unoccupied parking spaces using photos of the parking lot. Edge detection helps in many ways in 
processing the image by noise reduction, locating the intensity gradient in the image, non-maximum suppression and 
hysteresis threshold. In the other section, a digital image consists of columns and rows of pixels. A pixel in a particular 
image can be identified by determining which column and row it belongs to. The graphic system would then transform 
the image coordinates into pixel coordinates.

1.Introduction
Anggi Sahfutri et al. (2018) developed Smart Parking Using Wireless Sensor Network System With the successful 
application of modern parking using wireless sensor networking parking spots are spotted and imparted to a database. 
The sole non-theoretical aspect of the smart parking tenancy tracking and perception system for smart cities is that it 
allows cars to determine open parking places rather than their actual location. As it can’t be possible to find the exact 
location in replacement of this technique, Image processing technique is followed to know the image of the parking 
area to find out empty space. Paul Melnyk et al. (2019) presented Towards a smart parking management system for 
smart cities which makes parking easier, faster and it also reduces drivers search time for empty parking. This 
technique used only in large car parks by rapidly decreasing battery life with the increasing precision requirements. 
This smart parking system platform is supported by mobile app. Wiedjaja Atmadja et al. (2014) developed Parking 
Guidance System Based on Real Time Operating System,which measures sensor measurement range determine the 
safe distance and also update time. The cost of setting up a sound, operational parking management program is usually 
considerable due to the high cost of structure or installation.  Bibi et al. (2017) proposed Automatic parking space 
detection.  By simple video the empty parking space is identified by Automatic parking space detection system and 
drivers could go to that particular area. If they are any small objects which blocks the view though it is not fully 
blocked it shows that space is full. Here as replacement optical character recognition technique is used so that if only 
the number assigned is totally blocked then it shows that the parking lot is filled.Ibisch et al. (2013) developed Towards 
autonomous driving in a parking garage: Vehicle localization and tracking using environment-embedded LIDAR 
sensors where Vehicle locating and monitoring using environment-embedded lidar sensors minimizes drivers search 
time for empty parking. It reduces the drivers stress while driving. The usage of sensors is not cost effective and using 
it everywhere is not possible. In replacement of sensors Open Cv library is used.  Das (2019) proposed a novel parking 
system which is outlined for smart cities can provide real-time data for motor vehicle owners with mitigation and 
attainability. Lots of data need to be collected to run this application. As there is involvement of cloud computing

The following figure 6 shows the image of parking lot after processing we can see that there are red boxes and green

5. Conclusion 
The parking spot identification is the primary section of the smart parking system. This can be accomplished by placing 
sensors throughout the parking lot. However, this is an extremely expensive system with numerous flaws. The 
technology is simple and inexpensive thanks to image processing-based vacant parking lot recognition. For empty slot 
recognition, all that can be done now is use the photographs from the parking lot CCTV camera. An OpenCV-based 
solution will power future smart parking systems. The accuracy of detection can be increased by using appropriate 
image processing methods.

Abstract 
The paper primarily aims to understand the employees job satisfaction levels in news channels using the multi-grade 
fuzzy approach. Job satisfaction level will enable news channels to evaluate their current level of employees and their 
expectations, identify strong and weak attributes, and thereby make necessary improvements to them. The employees’ 
job satisfaction index of case-news channel is an average of 7.23, which indicates that the current job satisfaction level 
in the news channel is ‘highly satisfied.’ The study was further extended to find the weaker attributes using Importance 
Performance Analysis. The case-news channel’s weaker attributes were found to be “remuneration”, “promotion”, 
“position”, “sick leave”, and “social support”. This framework will help news channel’s managers to measure the job 
satisfaction of employees and give more importance to the weaker attributes to boost their job satisfaction level.

Job satisfaction, News channel, Working environment, Multi-grade fuzzy, and  Importance Performance Analysis 
1. Introduction
Employment satisfaction can be described as a measure of a worker's comfort with what they do in their job, even if 
they like their work or any particular attribute or aspect of the work, like the nature of the work or administration. 
Journalism is considered a profession that requires high truthfulness with oneself and towards its audience too and 
expects a high quality of commitment from its practitioners. For many, job satisfaction is based on both spiritual and 
material benefits. The study tries to identify various attributes that affect job satisfaction in news channels.  
News channels are very important to the public as they act as a resource that provides information about the world to 
the public in simple language. So taking care of the people who provide this information is a must, as the public trusts 
them. This study tries to understand the attributes that affect employee contentment of people working in news 
channels in various designations. The unique contribution of this study is the usage of a multi-grade fuzzy framework 
to evaluate job satisfaction in news channels, which helps them to enhance their understanding of job satisfaction.  
This study also provides an understanding of weaker attributes that are possible and can affect employee satisfaction 
in news channels by using Importance Performance Analysis (IPA). Acknowledging these weaker attributes will 
enable the HR manager to recover their employee’s dissatisfaction with their job and make their work-life better.  
There are numerous news channels and, hence, there is a need for the organization to satisfy their employees as much 
as possible to increase their business.  
The research questions (RQ) that have been answered through this study are  
RQ1: How can job satisfaction be measured in the news channels?   
RQ2: What are the enablers, criteria, and attributes that influence the job satisfaction of workers in the news channels? 
RQ3: How can weaker attributes be addressed to enhance job satisfaction in news channels? 
2. Literature Review
Smucker et al.(2003) studied female sports journalists’ job satisfaction and indicated that they have fewer promotional 
opportunities compared to their male colleagues. Badawy and Magdy, (2017)  study revealed that workload and 
perceived quality of news were associated with job satisfaction significantly. Also, competitors played a role in job 
satisfaction. Dziuba et al., (2020) talk about the importance of job satisfaction and how it can affect the safety and

6. Practical Implication 
This study has twenty-four attributes that can be considered as factors that can affect employee satisfaction in news 
channels. These attributes were categorized into five main categories. This study can be considered the first study to 
have used multi-grade fuzzy to assess employee satisfaction of employees in news channels. This study enables one 
to understand the factors affecting employee satisfaction and also point out the weaker attributes using Importance 
Performance Analysis (IPA) in news channels. The results of this study can provide knowledge on how news channel 
organizations can work to achieve employee satisfaction among their employees, which will result in their long-term 
growth. This study offers a list of attributes that can benefit both individuals and organizations. HR managers are the 
spinal cord between the employee and the organization. This study can help HR managers of news channels understand 
their employees more and focus more on their problems. Through IPA, the study provides the managers with the 
opportunity to know the weaker attributes and work on them to make employee satisfaction in news channels 
extremely satisfied. Employees in any organization are considered the biggest investment and, hence, their welfare 
and job satisfaction are something the top management should give the most priority. The same applies to news 
channels too. Half of the employees on the news channel represent the face of their respective organizations and 
provide information to the public. To provide quality news, each individual should have a feeling of belonging to their 
organization to work to the fullest. This study can help HR managers of a news channel effectively improve the 
efficiency of employees in their organization and achieve the long-term growth of the news channel. The continuous 
assessment of this study will help to analyze the difference the attributes can make in the news channel and also 
improve the higher performance of weaker attributes. 
 
7. Conclusion  
The research provides an understanding of what attributes affect the contribution of work the employees of the news 
channel can have. The objective of this study was accomplished by assessing news channels and understanding the 
weaker attributes that affect employee satisfaction in news channels. Using the multi-grade fuzzy model and case 
study, it was found that the employee satisfaction in case-news channels is “highly satisfied”. Further, the study also 
provides an understanding of what the weaker attributes are that can affect employee satisfaction in news channels 
using IPA, which can be improved when focused on in order to achieve “extremely satisfied” employees in news 
channels. The continuous assessment of this research further makes it understand how the attributes are changing in

Abstract 
Process Capability indices (PCIs) such as 
p
C and 
pk
C
 are commonly used measures to evaluate a manufacturing 
processes performance. The validity of these measures is based on that quality characteristics data under evaluation 
is normality distributed and the manufacturing process in under statistical control. The 
p
C  measure considers the 
process data is centering the specification band. However, it lacks to evaluate a process off-centering the given 
specification band. The 
pk
C
 measure which is 2nd generation considers the off-centering issue of any process being 
evaluated for its performance. Addressing the indeterminate and incomplete information about the different 
specification limits (SLs), the process capability indices 
p
C and 
pk
C
 is designed under the neutrosophic fuzzy 
environment. The neutrosophic fuzzy SLs contains three different aspects of membership degrees such as truth, 
indeterminacy, and falsity degrees which is more flexible to the fuzzy based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed 
neutrosophic PCIs 
p
C and 
pk
C
 is implemented on the rubber parts manufacturing company. The results show the 
more reliable values of PCIs while dealing with the indeterminacy degree present in the SLs. The wide range of 
getting different SLs is also benchmark findings of the proposed neutrosophic PCIs study. The conclusions and 
future work scope is also furnished in an efficient manner. 
Keywords 
Neutrosophic fuzzy set, Indeterminacy membership function, Neutrosophic numbers, Process Monitoring, 
Neutrosophic Process Capability Indices.
1. Introduction
Process capability indices (PCIs) played vital role to improve the operational efficiency of manufacturing products 
and processes thus resulting in significant reduction of process losses that occur due to non-compliance to customer 
specifications. Although process capability indices such as 
p
C and 
pk
C
are being extensively applied in industry to 
assess process performances but there is a lack of understanding among quality practitioners that these capability 
measures are essentially based on statistical theory of normality. If the basic assumptions of statistical theory are 
violated the capability assessments can mislead to wrong conclusions.

4.1. Results and Discussion 
The results are obtained based on the nature of neutrosophic numbers used such as TI-SVNN and TII-SVNN. It can 
be observed that with help of fuzzy approach the maximum membership degree attained is 1, whereas the truth, 
indeterminacy and falsity membership degrees of neutrosophic 
N
p
C
 are determined 0.95, 0.05 and 0.075, 
respectively. Looking at the results, one can conclude that the obtained results contain more information about 
process capability indices. All the membership functions are flexible in nature and contain the information based on 
the different perceptions and views of the decision-makers. It has also integrated the PCA with the indeterminacy 
degrees. More precisely, the neutrosophic process capability measurement approach are based on more logical 
aspects of human decision-making behavior and also can define the instability of human decisions in a better way. 
Additionally, the NSs provide an advantage over fuzzy sets while applying various operations by the quality 
engineers. 
 
The obtained results of TII-SVNN are also compared with FSs. It is observed that in addition to membership and 
non-membership functions of IFSs, indeterminacy function in NSs provides an opportunity to examine process 
capability in more detail. According to the results, it is seen that the crisp value of neutrosophic 
N
p
C
  is 1.19, but at 
the same time, it cannot be less than 1.09 and greater than 1.29. The result shows that the biggest advantage of NSs 
over other new fuzzy set extensions is the uncertainty function. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Process capability analysis (PCA) is very important and integral part of the manufacturing system to timely monitor 
the processes. For the PCA, various statistical based measures are available which are capable to analyze the 
processes. The PCIs such as 
p
C and 
pk
C
are the most commonly used methods which are available in the literature. 
The presented study discusses the PCIs under the NSs environment dealing with the uncertainty and incomplete 
information more accurately and efficiently. The NSs is the generalization and extension of the traditional fuzzy 
sets. It contains the three different forms of assessing the uncertainty such as independency truth, indeterminacy and 
falsity functions that enhance the capability of the processes related to the uncertain model. Most often, it seems that 
the quality engineer may not have the enough ideas or complete information for making the perfect and fruitful 
decisions. For instance, if the quality engineer shares the views or opinion with 0.4, 0.8, 0.2 as true, indeterminacy, 
and falsity value, respectively then only the NSs can be successfully used to tackle this situation. On analyzing the 
literature on PCAs, it is found that the use of the conventional fuzzy set is discussed tremendously and a narrow part 
of the literature or the research work is dedicated to the NSs uncertainty. Therefore, this research fills this gap and 
led to a concrete base for PCAs under NSs.

The NSs provides the flexible state-of-art while applying to the engineering problems. The conventional PCIs such 
as 
p
C and 
pk
C
 are discussed under the neutrosophic environment and re-structured based on the NSs. Aiming to 
this purpose, the SLs are represented as trapezoidal single-valued neutrosophic numbers under different condition 
and PCAs are analyzed by investigating the neutrosophic SLs. We have also explored the advantage and the merits 
of NSs with the PCAs. The two neutrosophic process capability indices 
N
p
C
and 
N
pk
C
 is investigated and 
implemented on the manufacturing system problems. The obtained neutrosophic PCIs exhibits the wholesome and 
effective knowledge about the capability of process as compared to the conventional fuzzy set approaches. In the 
future, the different extensions of fuzzy set such as intuitionistic fuzzy, hesitant fuzzy, spherical fuzzy etc. can be 
applied to analyze the PCAs.

Abstract 
In CPU scheduling the classical problem of real-time and time-sharing operating systems is to schedule a 
sequence of jobs; the only given information, in this case, is the processing and completion time of the particular 
processes. All the previous scheduling algorithms focused on the system-level abstraction for the scheduling 
decision functions or the functions which implement them. In this research, a new scheduling algorithm, an 
Adaptive Multi-level Queue scheduling, will maximise the CPU utilisation and cater to the energy efficiency of 
the embedded system. This scheduling algorithm can adapt to the environment. The scheduling algorithm will 
be helpful in the embedded devices which are using a fixed battery. The scheduler combines various types of 
well-established scheduling algorithms like – Round-robin, Priority (Pre-emptive) and Multi-Level Queue 
feedback algorithms. The Adaptive feature incorporates a sleeping function in the scheduling algorithm which 
helps in the system energy optimisation.

1. Introduction
According to the well-established definition an embedded OS is well calibrated operating which is used to 
perform particular tasks for a device which is not a computer. The base-level job of an embedded system is to 
execute the code/programme which can do the specific task. As all the operating systems do, the embedded 
operating system also acts as a bridge between the hardware and software of a system. An OS is software that 
allows software abstraction and manages hardware resources. The embedded operating systems are used in the 
micro-controllers and the micro-processors for various tasks. These tasks include process control, industrial 
automation, multimedia, communication and command control. We come across embedded operating systems in 
our daily life, for example – Microwave, Refrigerator, Laser Printers, Calculators, Electronic Toys, Automatic 
LED lights and Automated Water Filters; these are all embedded systems using embedded operating systems.  
Various types of RTOS – 
1. Hard Real-Time Systems
2. Soft Real-Time Systems
The OS where all the computations need to be performed in a specific time is known as Hard RTOS. On the 
Contrary, the operating system where strict adherence to time is not guaranteed is known as the soft real-time 
operating system.

Abstract 
The agricultural sector has a prominent role in contributing to the economy of many countries. Over the decades, 
production in the agricultural sector has decreased due to various factors such as leaf diseases, an overdose of chemical 
medication, natural disasters, and climatic changes. Majorly, the impact of plant diseases set a huge loss to the farmers 
compared to other kinds. Consulting an expert is a time taking and expensive process. Many machine learning and 
advanced deep learning algorithms are being implemented to identify diseases, more accurately, using the infected 
plant leaf image. The objective of this paper is to introduce a lightweight leaf disease detection Neural Network 
(LDDNet) that should be able to distinguish between diseased and healthy plants. The dataset contains 33 classes of 
different diseased and healthy plant leaves images, where each class has 1,680 training and 420 validating images. 
The accuracy obtained by the proposed LDDNet model is 99.30%. Since the performance of the model is high, it can 
be implemented in daily life to monitor plant diseases to have a healthy crop yielding.

1. Introduction
Agriculture is one of the major sectors in India. It is a vital occupation of people in most developing and populated 
countries. India's economy contributed by the agricultural sector is fluctuating for a long time due to the loss of crop 
production. The majority of the losses are due to native and non-native diseases that plants get infected with. Plant 
diseases are generally caused due to biotic and abiotic matters. Bacteria, fungi, animals, etc, come under biotic matter. 
Soil, air, water, minerals, sunlight, etc, come under abiotic matters. Disease-causing organisms are also called 
pathogens, some of them are fungi, bacteria, and viruses (Kaur et al. 2018). Every year pathogens affect plants, 
resulting in less or sometimes low yield. Hence, it leads to food scarcity, and even consuming such products can be 
unhealthy. Many chemical medications and new cultivation techniques were introduced, and some are being 
implemented in daily life. Many studies have concluded that early detection and diagnosis result in better production. 
For early detection, in-depth knowledge and rigorous surveillance is needed that involves the deployment of a lot of 
the workforce. The most effective way to detect the disease is using computer-based knowledge, such as image 
processing techniques and computer vision, in which the image of plant leaves is involved in the detection. The 
improvement of technology and detection techniques in image processing revolutionized in improving accurate 
detection. Many machine learning algorithms came into use for the classification of diseases like SVM (Pantazi et al. 
2016, Venkataramana et al. 2022), decision tree (Sabrol and Satish 2016), and KNN (Sabrol and Satish 2016). 
However, traditional machine learning algorithms aren't so capable of detecting complex patterns, which affects the 
performance of the overall model, and for large datasets, computation time also increases drastically. Later on, as 
technology advanced, many deep learning models, replacing traditional machine learning algorithms, came into use. 
This paper introduces a deep learning model called LDDNet, which was referenced from the Residual Network 
(ResNet) architecture, and presents an overview of its performance in classifying unseen data. 
Section 2 contains the cited papers' work-study. The proposed model is described clearly in Section 3. Section 4 
explains the dataset and simulation result of LDDNet. Finally, section 5 brings this paper's entire effort to a conclusion.

 Flask framework gives the flexibility to develop quick and easy web applications using python. We have used 
REST APIs with HTTP methods GET and POST. The application has 2 buttons, one is for uploading the leaf image 
and the other is for submitting the uploaded image into the loaded model. The model evaluates the result upon 
clicking the submit button and displays the output along with the uploaded image in the block that was surrounded 
by sky-blue color. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Accurate classification of plant leaf disease is very essential to look for plants and soil health. The proposed novel 
architecture, LDDNet, can identify 24 different plant leaf diseases and 9 healthy plants with an accuracy of 99.30%. 
The model performs better than many other existing deep neural networks in the area of plant leaf disease detection 
in terms of accurate detection. LDDNet is extended further by developing a web application so users can access it 
easily at any time. This project can further be expanded by adding different diagnosis techniques along with the 
authorized purchasing links in the web application to buy organic products that slow down the rapid spread. Since the 
study on LDDNet shows that it is efficient enough to detect unseen data successfully, farmers can implement this 
model in daily life for monitoring crop health, thereby reducing unnecessary costs for detecting plant diseases.

Abstract 
Net Present Value (NPV) is an important financial metric for the purposes of accepting or rejecting Projects in the 
Corporate Environment. The authors advocate limited free NPV applications available to the Management and 
Commerce Student or the Corporate Finance practitioner. The proposed application enables the analysis of NPV when 
factors such as Cost of Goods Sold to Sales Ratio; Capital Expenditure to Sales Ratio; Selling, General and 
Administrative Expense to Sales Ratio; Sales Growth Rate, Depreciation to Sales Ratio are available as inputs. Further, 
the parameters like Corporate Tax Rate with number of Years until Constant Growth and Firm Risk Level proxied by 
the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) are deemed available as inputs for the simulation. The approximate 
run-time for 5,000 simulations is less than one minute. Several useful outputs can be derived by the simulation of the 
proposed application. First, a graph of each of the distributions pertaining to the input variables is displayed. The User 
can select the type of distribution for each input variables, namely: Normal Distribution, Triangular Distribution and 
Uniform Distribution. In addition, a Base Case NPV is also computed for a set of Base Case input variables. By virtue 
of the attained cumulative probability NPV diagram, User can determine the probability whether NPV is less than or 
equal to a certain value. In addition, a sensitivity table is provided in the proposed application which displays the 
impact of input variables in the descending order based on the attained stochastic NPV results.

1. Introduction
Fischer introduced Net Present Value (NPV) in 1907 when he discussed in the paper, the rate of Interest '' where 
Capital was defined as an asset that produced income in various time frames or time periods. The notion of computing 
the value of a series of cash flows with a suitable discount rate was introduced as a concept. Discount rates were 
expected to account for inflation, as were the cash flows. According to Gaspars-Wieloch (2019), there are four 
techniques in accounting for Uncertainty in NPV measurement. Firstly, a technique is to amplify the discount rate, 
Secondly to use a range of values as the possible outcomes and this falls into a category called Sensitivity Analysis. 
Thirdly, Cash Flows are compared with Optimistic and Pessimistic values of Cash Flows and finally, the Cash flows 
are estimated with Scenario Planning and the use of Probability Distributions. 
The states of Probability are estimated from prior data. Carnap (1950) argued in favor of premise-based conclusions 
or decision-making in the presence of frequencies of occurrence of events. Hau et al. (2010) investigated the gap 
between apriori and statistical probabilities as conceptualized by Knight (1921) and corroborated that rare events 
played a role in the relevance of the presence of the gap between apriori and statistical probabilities. In contrast, Guo 
and Ma (2014) analyzed newsvendor models for innovative products with a one-shot decision theory framework that 
focused on possibility rather than probability distribution and made use of scenario models as an alternative to decision 
making. NPV estimation with uncertainty with the help of Optimistic and Pessimistic coefficient values was done 
extensively in Gaspars-Wieloch (2019) and it applied scenario planning as well as decision maker’s attitude in relation 
to a certain problem related to computation of NPV. The motivation to write, and contribution from this particular 
paper comes from a desire to contribute to the computation of NPV when the input variables follow probabilistic 
distributions. Thus, the methodology deviates from Gaspars-Wieloch (2019) in that input variables are subject to 
various types of Probability Distributions and the resulting NPV is computed for each simulation. The empirical 
results, when tabulated, can generate interesting probability distributions, which in turn can be useful to the practitioner 
as well as Graduate Students in Finance and Commerce. In addition, Sensitivity Analysis can be conducted with each

6. Conclusion 
The NPV pdf is a normal distributional though the underlying Input Variables have different types of distributions, 
ranging from Normal to Triangular to Uniform. Our paper is different from prior work in NPV calculation under 
Uncertainty e.g., Gaspars-Wieloch, H. (2019), who modeled NPV under Scenario based optimistic and pessimistic 
coefficients. The Ranges of the Input Variable are selected by the user, and future development should focus on the 
detection of the type of distribution from historical information. From Table 2 and Figure 9, it is clear that the WACC 
% has the highest impact on the NPV fluctuation while the CA-CL to Sales % has the least impact on NPV fluctuation. 
Sales growth%, TY Growth % have high impact while COGS/Sales %, Depr/Sales % and Capex to Sales % have 
lower impact on NPV fluctuation.

Abstract 
“Haat” is a periodic rural market in India that often occurs once or twice a week. Since time, Haat has fulfilled 
the daily basic requirements of rural India. Indian Haats have been facing several challenges over the years. This 
study first aimed at understanding the primary challenges faced by the rural retailers in Haat. This is done by 
surveying a local Haat, famous as “BIT Haat” located at the Mesra Village near Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. Initial 
discussion with the retailers revealed that significant portions of the retailers are poor and do not have high buying 
capacity. Their profit margin fluctuates with the increased demand variability of the market. Thus, often it became 
difficult for them to estimate the order quantity of various perishable items. In this work, the optimal order quantity 
of various perishable vegetables are first calculated by using newsvendor model. However, the market restrictions 
often does not allow the retailers to buy the exact amount suggested by the newsvendor model. Hence, a sensitivity 
analysis procedure is applied to compare among the newsvendor model based demand profit, present profit, and 
a profit on the next feasible order quantity based upon the suggestion of the newsvendor model. It is observed 
that, the change in order quantity provides beneficial result in increasing the average profit of the retailer in many 
of the items.

1. Introduction
Rural India consists of an overall 65% of the total population in India (The World Bank data, 2020). The rural 
population in India mainly depends upon local markets named “Haat” to fulfil their household requirements of 
vegetables, dairy products, fish and many Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). These Haats are not daily 
markets. Haat is a weekly or bi-weekly market. According to The Financial Express survey (2011), there are more 
than 43,000 Haats in India. Instead of touching several lives, these rural markets are facing many challenges. 
Bhusan (2019) identified communication, transportation, warehousing, seasonal demand variation, socio-cultural 
factors, low per capita income, and poor infrastructure are major challenges in these rural markets. Some other 
major issues found by other researchers are sustainability issues (high energy and water consumption Kucukvar 
and Samadi 2015, waste management Eriksson and Spångberg 2017, etc.), food waste (Gustavsson et al. 2011, 
Scherhaufer et al. 2018, Corrado and Sala 2018, etc.), infrastructure (Gardas et al., 2019), uncertainties (Borodin 
et al., 2016). Though several researchers have identified various challenges in rural markets, these challenges are 
mainly case-specific. Moreover, most of the research concentrated on the study of environmental issues and farmer 
issues. The issues pertained by local retailers who sell in these markets remain an important area to work on.  
This study aims first to understand the issues faced by the local retailers at a rural Haat, named BIT Haat, located 
in the Mesra village in the Kanke district near Ranchi, Jharkhand. This Haat is a lifeline for three near about 
villages Mesra, Rodia, Hutup, attending primary needs of around 2100 households while touching the lives of 
approximately 12,000 population. The spread of the Haat is around one acre. This Haat occurs bi-weekly on 
Wednesdays and Saturdays. A random visit to the Haat reveals around 131 various types of retail shops. A list of 
multiple retail shops available on the day of visit are provided in Table 1. However, the number of shops varies 
from 100 to 150. 
All the goods that are sold in this Haat can be broadly divided into two categories, viz., 1) perishable goods, 2) 
nonperishable goods. Green vegetables, fruits, chicken, and fish mainly comes under the perishable goods 
category, whereas the others can be considered nonperishable goods. Upon discussion with various retailers, it is 
found that chicken is sold mainly on demand. The retailers of fish items usually have a particular refrigeration 
system to keep the remaining fish for a certain period. While looking at the green vegetable sellers, it is found that

6. Conclusions 
This study identifies suitable order quantities of various items, which stabilizes the profit for a retailer who sells 
perishable items, a significant challenge in the rural market. It considers the case of a local Haat, where rural 
retailers sell vegetables and other household necessary items. The rural vegetable seller considered in this study 
has low buying power. Hence, the order quantity of various vegetables is limited. Thus, arbitrary increments of 
order quantities are not feasible and suitable for these sellers. This study thoroughly examines the demand 
variation and order quantities of a local vegetable seller in Haat and tries to develop a methodology to determine 
a suitable order quantity for each item sold by a rural vegetable seller. At first newsvendor model is applied to 
identify which item requires possible increment or decrement in order quantity. Then the next possible order 
quantity is selected as a candidate for the modified order quantity. Then several random demands are generated 
to compare the average profit for the present order quantity and adjusted order quantity to justify if the modified 
order quantity is feasible in increasing profit for the retailer. The result based on the case study suggests that, in 
some cases, though the newsvendor model suggested a change in order quantity, the sensitivity analysis does not 
guarantee a possible profit increment, whereas in some cases sensitivity analysis confirms the result direction of 
the newsvendor model.  
 
It is worthwhile to discuss here that the study was performed under a certain seasonal period, and hence the study 
is limited by the available vegetables and their demands during that season only. In addition, it is observed that 
the quality of the vegetables, which they buy in bulk quantity from the wholesale market, varies each day. This 
study considers this variability as constant.  
 
There are several possibilities of future studies found while observing the rural market. Firstly, it was observed 
that the demand of many vegetables depend upon the selling price. It will be interesting study if the demand can 
be represented as function of selling price of a vegetable, and then calculate the optimal order quantity of the 
vegetables. Secondly, the price change of a vegetable highly depends upon quality. More or less each retailers 
provide price discounts if purchased at higher quantity. Thus determining selling price as a stochastic function 
rather than a simple variable would also be a very interesting future scope of this study. Thirdly, this paper only 
depicts as a the condition of a single retailer within the “Haat”. It will  be very interesting to carry out a complete 
study considering total selling of various vegetables by most (if not all) of the retailers to understand the buying 
behavior of the people of the entire population who avails the market.

Abstract 
Cancer is among the most prevalent causes of mortality worldwide. Breast cancer is one of most often diagnosed 
cancers, with over 200 different varieties to choose from. Given the high prevalence of morbidity and death, early and 
accurate diagnosis are critical. For this purpose, symptoms must be carefully assessed and classified and this can be 
done by Machine Learning (ML) and Data Analytics techniques. The main goal of this research is to examine several 
ML and Deep Learning (DL) approaches for breast cancer diagnosis and accuracy prediction. The primary dataset 
being used for research purposes is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis dataset. The following are the findings of 
the algorithms used: 93.08 percent accuracy for Linear Regression, 93.61 percent accuracy for the K Nearest Neighbor, 
96.50 percent accuracy for Support Vector Machine, and 95.10 percent accuracy for Multilayer Perceptron 
approaches.

1. Introduction
Sha et al. (2020) Breast cancer can be diagnosed using detection of the tumor first using ultrasound, mammogram, 
biopsy, MRI etc. But the cost of detection using these can be very expensive. Applying ML and DL algorithms to 
detect threats earlier can be much easier and less expensive. Even though the symptoms are moderate in the beginning, 
the odds of survival rise dramatically if somehow the diagnosis is obtained as a consequence of early identification. 
FNAC, ultrasound assisted surgical biopsy, and mammography are among the several diagnostic procedures used to 
identify breast cancer. But detection of breast cancer using mammography is very poor in case of dense breasts and 
about 10%-20% cases go undetected. Shen et al. (2019) ML can be used for breast cancer detection by analyzing the 
tumor size. Mechanical learning methods are the best ways to get good results among the problems of differentiation 
and prediction. Although a large number of AI algorithms for detection of breast cancer have been developed, the 
accuracy of the models is varied. So, the selection of the proper model for the given problem is very important. Mridha 
et al. (2021) have implemented various ML and DL techniques which could be utilized for detecting and classifying 
breast cancer. The algorithms are: KNN, NB, RF, MP, SVM, LR. D. S. Seah et al. (2022) Biopsy is the ultimate 
confirmation of breast cancer detection but these ML and DL techniques can act as the foundation of early detection 
using Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI), X-Rays and other factors. With the advancement in the field of automated 
detection, the accuracy and the prediction scores have been getting better and been very helpful.

Figure 4. Relational Overview 
 
Figure 4 shows us that the relational data analysis can be done using different metrics and we choose those data which 
have higher correlation and show better results when used after feature selection. Diverse metrics such as the 
Compactness mean, and texture mean are considered for a relational overview. 
 
5.3 Validation 
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated. The visualization of the data takes place after the data has been pre-
processed and prepared via various methods.  Herein, as per their efficiency and effectiveness, an evaluation is 
conducted. We conducted experiments using different algorithms and the best accuracy is tabulated. As we can see 
with an accuracy of 97.902% RF outperforms the other algorithm in terms of accuracy and hence proves to be the best 
possible algorithm for cancer prediction. Followed by RF we have LR and KNN which are ML algorithms. 
 
6. Conclusion 
To restate, this paper is primarily about comparing the different ML and DL methods that can be used to detect breast 
cancer and its predictive accuracy. Our model followed a method wherein the first process is that of extracting features 
and using those for testing and training a transfer learning model. As indicated by the observations in this study, it 
was seen that the techniques could be used on the WBCD dataset for boosting the accuracy of classifying lesions in 
breast cancer. After training the model, it was found that all algorithms achieved an accuracy of 90% or higher, and

Abstract 
The goal of this study is to analyze the ergonomics literature in healthcare organisations in terms of major 
characteristics of existing publications, limitations, and future research opportunities. In two ways, it adds to the 
body of knowledge. To offer an overview of completed research initiatives, it separates the literature into seven 
categories: ""year,"" ""area,"" ""study technique,"" ""findings,"" ""setting,"" ""constraints,"" and ""future research orientation."" 
Second, it identifies a research gap in the current literature and proposes future study opportunities. According to the 
findings, previous research on the topic has struggled to provide a robust theoretical framework. More research will 
be required to validate the proposed ideas, concepts, and frameworks. As a result, the effects of ergonomics on 
caregivers or healthcare professionals have been extensively researched with small samples, leaving plenty of room 
for future research to validate and expand prior findings.

Literature Review 
1. Introduction
Over the last decade, ergonomics approaches have become more widely applied to healthcare delivery in a number of 
settings (Hignett et al. 2013). To reduce the risk of employee accident, ergonomic factors are crucial during the design 
phase (Stichler and Feiler 2011). Ergonomics have been recognized as important in healthcare since the profession's 
inception, but development and growth have been gradual. The first workshop on healthcare (hospital) ergonomics 
was held in Paris in 1991. In 1997, Francois Daniellou formed the ""Technical Committee on Healthcare Ergonomics 
and Patient Safety (HETC9)."" Since 2005, there have been frequent seminars on ""healthcare and patient safety 
ergonomics"", as well as symposia and presentations at ""clinical -patient safety conferences"" (Hignett et al. 2013). 
Ergonomics is the study of adapting or harmonizing workplace conditions and work requirements to the capabilities 
of the working population. A good ""fit"" in the workplace minimizes the incidence of disease and accident, increases 
production efficiency, improves quality of products or services, and increases employee engagement. Ergonomics 
discipline uses a variety of critical worker attributes and skills to build safe work environments (Waters 2010). HC 
delivery is a very dynamic work system that is always changing on many fronts, making it more difficult and, to be 
honest, convoluted. Internally and internationally, HC sends mixed messages, partly because it is continuously trying 
to figure out who it is and what it does (Perry et al. 2021). Ergonomics has had a remarkable increase in publications 
in the healthcare field over the last 50 years (Keebler et al. 2022). Despite this, healthcare employees are more likely 
than the majority of the workforce to develop an occupational ""musculoskeletal disorder (MSD)"" (Hedge et al. 2011). 
Healthcare systems are defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ""any organisations, individuals, or 
actions whose primary goal is to promote, restore, or sustain health."" It thus includes both measures to change health 
factors and much more supervise the activities to improve health"" (WHO 2007; page 2). Employees are a critical 
component of healthcare systems; they are the gasoline that keeps the entire system running and thus enhances the 
importance of ergonomics in healthcare organisations.  
This literature review discusses the ergonomics in healthcare organisations. This review addresses the following 
questions: 
RQ1: How has the ergonomics on healthcare organisations been studied in terms of ""year,"" ""region,"" ""research 
technique,"" ""context,"" and ""outcomes""? 
RQ2: What are the limitations of the existing literature? 
RQ3: What are the research directions for the ergonomics in healthcare organisations in the future? 
The paper's format comprises a review of the literature and its limitations, methods, future research directions, results 
and discussion, and a conclusion.

specialists utilize social strategies to engage with technical and non-technological challenges in workplace, and how 
creators' preconceived stereotypes impact the planning process and content, require more research (Holden 2012). 
Large-scale observations are required to record ergonomic risk variables and occupational tasks in complicated 
situations (Janowitz et al. 2006).  Future improvements and relevant procedures can be put to the test, especially in 
terms of safety and efficiency (Matern and Koneczny 2007). Future research should look into how widely these tactics 
can be used in the E/HF community. Prospective investigations should be undertaken to evaluate the present state of 
qualitative research conducted by E/HF researchers in the health care domain (Valdez et al. 2017). Further 
experimentation with more HFE work that aims to span ""micro and macro system levels"" is an obvious topic for 
advancement (Karsh 2014). To ensure that future ergonomists have the choice of adopting qualitative methodologies 
in research and practice, this must be provided in a robust and methodical manner (Hignett, 2001). Given the 
uncertainties surrounding the safety of technology in the dispensing scenario, future research on the incorporation of 
technological improvements in pharmacy practice may be beneficial (Weir et al. 2020). Azadeh et al. (2016) strongly 
advised to create and utilize fresh methodologies and approaches in this area. For future research, it is vital to increase 
the integrity of mixed research methods in healthcare ergonomics; thus, well-defined criteria for evaluating mixed 
methods research are required (Carayon et al. 2015). A quality assessment checklist for the broader subject of systems 
ergonomics should be developed in the future, covering all parts of research from the underpinning theory to data 
analysis and concluding creation (Hulme et al. 2019). 
6. Results and Discussion 
In this investigation, 40 published journal and conference papers were evaluated. They investigated on the ergonomics 
in healthcare organisation and the importance of the ergonomics in healthcare sector. Past research shows that 
ergonomics enhances the productivity and efficiency of the healthcare workers as well as the overall performance. 
The findings of the literature review are as follows: 
• 
Ergonomics experts should work closely with healthcare professionals to obtain a deeper understanding of 
the complex healthcare world, as well as to develop and grow clinical ergonomics and human 
factors application and understanding with an environment that can sustain meaningful long-term 
relationships (Hignett et al. 2013).  
• 
HF/E is poorly understood in medicine, and when ergonomics experts are involved, it is present in very small 
groups spanning various disciplines, and it is perceived as expensive and consuming time (Keebler et al. 
2022). There is a significant need to ergonomics awareness in the healthcare sector.  
• 
Telecommuting will undoubtedly grow more popular in the future, and ergonomic awareness, coaching, and 
training in the application of basic ergonomics ideas can help healthcare employees to ensure safe and 
healthy work environments regardless of where they commute (Hedge et al. 2011). 
• 
A holistic perspective which emphasizes upon enhancing interaction of people such as medical practitioners, 
health care workers, and patients as well as the other components that make up healthcare systems are 
essential; this connects vision of ""human factors and ergonomics"". This would lead to improved outcomes in 
regarding safety, wellness, well-being, and overall performance. (Rodríguez and Hignett 2021).  
• 
Healthcare systems must be reformed to deliver safe, effective, and efficient care that fulfils patients' diverse 
requirements (Xie and Carayon 2015).  
• 
Ergonomists can contribute to greater ""workplace risk management"" by promoting the need for change 
awareness; study on ""MSD-related workplace management"" concerns; and ergonomist training program 
(Macdonald and Oakman 2022). 
• 
The ergonomics internal environment must support the ongoing paradigm shift in terms of methodology 
breadth. To ensure that future ergonomists have the choice of adopting qualitative methodologies in research 
and practice, this must be provided in a robust and methodical manner (Hignett 2001) 
• 
Ergonomics is more akin to a technical training program, with an emphasis on real models and external 
industry tasks. 
7. Conclusion  
Ergonomics is the study of how to design healthy and secure environments wherein work requirements ""fit"" the 
abilities of the people who must complete the task. It is vital to understand this from this perspective (Waters 2010). 
Healthcare is a highly contested, complicated, and adaptive labor system, sector, and institution. Its natural beginnings, 
including individuals as being the only consistent and stimulant for work, produce a wide range of variability that 
restrict healthcare work dependability (Perry et al. 2021). Ergonomics aids in increasing productivity and reducing 
internal customer health issues (Tarcan 2004). Most of the papers are studied with a limited sample where the 
245","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

generalizability of the results is lost. The most common concern in the current literature is that most study publications 
fail to specify any potential research goals or limitations. This places a significant research gap in future research by 
requiring researchers to remove the barriers that impede healthcare practitioners from exploring techniques. The 
limitation of this study: considered and selected only English language papers where other language papers were 
missed.

Abstract 
The purpose of the study is to provide a literature review of the past literature on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
in start-ups, covering major characteristics of current findings, limitations, and prospective study possibilities. It 
contributes to the collection of knowledge in two ways. It first categorizes the literature primarily on seven parameters 
to offer a summary of accomplished research attempts: ""year,"" ""region,"" ""study technique,"" ""results,"" ""setting,"" 
""constraints,"" and ""future research direction."" Secondly, it identifies a study need in the published literature and 
proposes new research possibilities. According to the findings, the previous research has struggled to create a solid 
theoretical framework in the field. More research is required to validate the proposed ""theories,"" ""notions,"" and 
""paradigms."" In a nutshell, the lack of a comprehensive assessment of the implementation of artificial intelligence in 
start-up literature leaves a significant void for additional investigation.

1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) reconfigures business, the economy, and culture by converting stakeholder and public 
perspectives and connections (Loureiro et al. 2020). Artificial intelligence and other disruptive innovations are altering 
the contest guidelines in industries worldwide. Artificial intelligence possibilities are considered the essential 
technological advancement in their immense possibilities for adding worth and competitive advantage (Reim et al. 
2020).  
The term artificial intelligence refers to a broad subject that has been characterized using phrases such as ""machine 
intelligence,"" intelligent agents,"" ""intelligent behavior,"" ""intelligent systems,"" and ""algorithms"" (AlSheibani et al. 
2018). Across the whole of origins, the main driver of rapidly increasing living norms has been advanced. 
Nevertheless, the procedure of creativity can be incredibly disruptive since it yields conventional techniques obsolete 
(Soni et al. 2020). Technological and inventive start-ups have shown a powerful capacity to evolve and modify to 
global pandemic episodes and other challenges: one-third have changed their business model, half have gained new 
customers, and forty-four percent have speeded up product advancement (Di Bernardo et al. 2021). Artificial 
intelligence technologies have evolved to a degree of effectiveness (Soni et al. 2020) that provides new business 
functionality with considerable value creation possibility. Artificial intelligence-enabled start-ups abilities assure 
considerable advantages in increased velocity, reliability, uniformity, expandability, and cost savings.   
Today, the research on start-ups and artificial intelligence is relatively thin, and there is still little scientific proof on 
the topic (Vijai and Wisetsri 2021). Still, the circumstances are encouraging rather than merely optimistic. Innovative 
technologies may further increase start-up scalability, but more details are required based on the implementation of 
AI in start-ups. Thus, this study proposes a review on the adoption of artificial intelligence in start-ups. The study's 
findings allow for the portrayal of some insights and perspectives on the adoption of artificial intelligence and can aid 
in the development and viability of start-ups. This review addresses the following research question: 
RQ1: How have the adoption of artificial intelligence in start-ups been investigated in terms of a ""year,"" ""region,"" 
""research technique,"" ""context,"" and ""outcomes?"" 
RQ2: What are the limits of the existing literature? 
RQ3: What are the future areas of research for the start-ups adopting artificial intelligence? 
The format of the paper includes: ""the review of the literature and its limitations;"" ""methodology;"" ""research direction 
for future research;"" ""results and discussions;"" and ""conclusion."" 
248","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

such artificial intelligence systems can produce extremely inspiring and profitable results. Future research should also 
demonstrate various types of evolving business model archetypes (Lee et al. 2019). 
6. Discussion
In this investigation, 40 published journal and conference papers were evaluated. They investigated the artificial 
intelligence application in start-ups and the importance of the adoption of artificial intelligence technologies in various 
firms. Past research shows that incorporating artificial intelligence in start-ups will enhance their start-up operations 
and will reduce their failure rates. The findings of the literature review are as follows: 
•
Although it includes laws and moral considerations, the studies examined are primarily concerned with
displaying solutions to practical problems. It was discovered that the method to be used for implementing the
remedies displayed is determined by the type of issue in each scenario.
•
Machine learning could be used in a variety of hazards, exposure, and impact scenarios. The studies also
anticipate which areas will see a rise in the use of machine learning.
•
Technological advancement in digitization significantly boosts efficiency.
•
The prevailing and anticipated disruptive effects of artificial intelligence and robotics on business and
economics in the early phases of the ""Space Economy"" would be in the coming years.
•
Some of the main benefits of digitization, intelligent systems, and data analysis using artificial intelligence
algorithms include increased profitability, cost and time efficiency, reduced human error, quicker
management decisions, consumer preferential forecasting, and increased sales.
•
The main discoveries are that throughout the pandemic episodes, artificial intelligence can be utilized to keep
social distance, undertake business operations from a safe location, improve customer delivery, create
business for start-ups, and provide an edge over its competitors.
•
A system perspective is required for artificial intelligence to be more effectively used in start-ups. Customer
communication and comprehension of client needs are important aspects of ecosystem management.
•
Start-ups, on the other hand, are entering an age of artificial intelligence-powered revolutionary innovation,
defined by connectivity, intelligence, and customization rather than internet-based or human-driven services.
•
Start-ups must determine whether building solutions on existing artificial intelligence platforms is the best
way to achieve their value creation goals.
•
Start-ups should evolve unique skills and attain a definite level of maturity when using artificial intelligence
as a precursor for digitalization through business model innovation.
•
The obstacles arise during the implementation of artificial intelligence so that the actors can progressively
pertain to the artificial intelligence requirements and minimize the impacts that arise as a result of the project's
execution.
•
The obstacles of artificial intelligence implementation in the start-ups can be influenced by variables entailing 
employees, such as job loss risk and opposition to implementation, as well as any other problem with
technology migration
•
Preliminary proof implies that artificial intelligence can provide an actual benefit to early adopters and be a
strong disruptive force.
•
Start-ups must sketch out that computers and humans can complement each other's abilities to gain a
competitive advantage if artificial intelligence is to become a significant aspect of future strategies.
7. Conclusion
Due to the importance and significance of artificial intelligence, particularly among start-ups, we recognized and 
synthesized the academic, scientific, and professional basics that launch, support, and complement the artificial 
intelligence application core concepts, processes, and approaches. the study shows that entrepreneurs have a better 
chance of deploying artificial intelligence. This shows that academics have started to recognize the importance of 
artificial intelligence in the development of start-up operations. The advantages are especially rewarding for a start-
up because they typically have scarce resources, so any chance to digitize, enhance, standardize, and relieve the work 
process is greatly appreciated. Artificial intelligence-powered inventive remedies offer precise, insightful information 
about customer wants and needs, enabling these rapidly growing start-ups to rapidly make transformations to their 
established portfolio of products and services or create new ones that meet customer anticipations. Evidently, wiser 
start-ups that adopt artificial intelligence-led advancement will be able to react to upcoming events in a fast and 
effective manner while not impeding their expansion procedure. The discovery of numerous viewpoints linked to the 
phenomenon, as well as the application of AI to other service sectors, are two potential research paths that will 
necessitate creative effort from relevant study practitioners and academicians. Many published research falls short to

reveal the study’s constraints or suggestions for future areas of research, which is one of the most serious weaknesses 
in the current literature. This makes future studies into overcoming the constraints to permitting artificial intelligence 
in start-ups unfeasible. Generally, there haven't been a lot of studies on the adoption of artificial intelligence in start-
ups, which leaves a lot of scope for future research.

Abstract 
This study investigates the impact of customers' perceptions of multidimensional corporate social responsibility 
(philanthropic, ethical, legal, and economic) on coffee shop customer retention, which examines the case of 
Starbucks in India. The findings show that economic CSR, ethical CSR, and philanthropic CSR are all important 
contributors to enhanced brand attitude and service quality, according to PLS structural equation modelling of 300 
survey responses. Client retention improved as a result of the relationships. The current study contributes to a 
broader understanding of CSR strategy in the coffee shop business, as well as valuable insights into the same, by 
revealing how various CSR actions impact customers' views of brand attitude, service quality, and customer 
retention.

1. Introduction
According to Euromonitor International, with a market size of Rs 2,570 crore in 2018, India is the world's 10th 
fastest growing business sector for freshly prepared café chains. The café business, which is dominated by Tata 
Starbucks and Cafe Coffee Day, is also one of the fastest expanding categories of the consumer food industry, with 
esteem agreements estimated to rise 6.9% annually to Rs 4,540 crore by 2023 at constant prices excluding growth 
(The Economic Times, 2019). The Indian bistro industry is assessed to show improvement at a CAGR of more than 
12% during 2019-2024. The market's outcome may be linked to growing demands from the young population, 
increased disposable income, corporate culture, rapid urbanisation, and a global way of life. In addition, the 
increasing number of two-income households, increased global openness, expanding development, and media entry 
are all driving growth in the Indian espresso bistro industry. Moreover, the growing amount of double pay 
residences, expanded global openness, expanded advances, and media access all contribute to the growth of the

Our findings revealed that both brand attitude and customer happiness have a significant impact on client retention. 
Clients will want to return and become loyal customers if favourable brand mentalities and customer satisfaction are 
developed via client experiences, resulting in a large slice of the pie and cash for café chains. 
4.1 Recommendations 
In recent years, India's coffee shop business has seen tremendous expansion; a number of new cafes have opened, 
and the usage of technology has progressed, resulting in strong rivalry in the field. To attract clients' attention, firm 
management and marketing managers must generate a competitive advantage and build a strong reputation for their 
branches. From this perspective, the current study is significant since it depicts CSR as a strategic marketing tool 
that will attract customers who share similar beliefs. The study validates its validity and relevance by advising cafés 
on why they should prioritise CSR activities in order to boost customer retention. The current study reveals that a 
chain's brand attitude has a considerable mediation influence on customer retention when it engages in CSR. 
Customers receive a good signal when CSR actions are effectively reported and promoted. Customers love coffee 
shops that are well known and acknowledged for their societal CSR activities, which leads to high retention. 
According to the study, café businesses should choose particular CSR objectives, explain these objectives to clients, 
and leverage them in the image-building process. Another critical component in the current study is customer 
satisfaction. The analysis reveals that customer satisfaction has a considerable mediating influence between CSR 
and retention. According to the findings, cafés should prioritize CSR initiatives that improve both the intellectual 
and emotional sides of consumer satisfaction. This implies that when services meet the expectations of the consumer 
and promise long-term mutual advantages (both monetary and non-monetary), it results in high customer 
satisfaction. 
Customers prefer customer-focused CSR activities such as great service quality, improved operations, community 
development, and so on, and they demonstrate their support by returning to the cafés. As a result, coffee shop chains 
and their marketing professionals should evaluate the impact of consumer satisfaction on retention. The marketing 
program must concentrate on the aspects of client satisfaction that are relevant to their offerings. Based on the 
results of the mediating and moderating effects of C-C identification, the study reveals that social identity theory is 
extremely important in leveraging the influence of CSR on customers. Cafes must develop and implement CSR 
initiatives with the goal of developing social identity among consumers. While designing these CSR activities, the 
marketing team should focus on creating social or self-identities for customers. Customers' dedication and good 
attitude toward the businesses' operations are enhanced by a high level of self-identity. 
5. Conclusion
In this research, we attempted to make sense of the impact of coffeehouse industry CSR on consumer retention. 
Other important perspectives in developing customer retention (such as brand attitude, service quality, and consumer 
happiness) were also incorporated as intervening elements into the proposed hypothetical framework. On account of 
café chains, scholarly writing has for the most part disregarded experimental exploration on CSR and its connection 
to development factors affecting visitors' post-buy conduct. The reasonable system used in this study provides useful 
insight into the influence of CSR on the customer retention process in the coffeehouse industry. Our applied model 
properly depicted the variability of client retention in the café industry. As a bridge, the effect of brand attitude, 
service quality, and consumer enjoyment was evaluated. The current study goes above and beyond by integrating the 
several components of corporate social responsibility, brand attitude, service quality, and customer pleasure in the 
coffeehouse business into a single applicable system.

Abstract 
Online social networks (OSNs) have gained a lot of popularity in the past few years. The capacity of OSNs to provide 
a way for users to interact with their peers is the driving force behind this phenomenon. Social media sites like 
Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have recently become an inextricable part of our everyday lives. Information sharing 
raises many security and privacy problems, in cases where users upload personal material such as photographs, videos, 
and audio. An attacker can take advantage of shared data for malevolent purposes. In the case of children, the risks 
are much higher. This study examines numerous risks associated with OSN and also possible ways that can secure 
social network users to address these issues. The research will also prove that DL is a viable and scalable approach 
for OSN's state-of-the-art PPS by using a deep neural network for identifying potential threats. The framework 
proposed in the chapter helps identify features related to attacks on Online Social Networks, determine the relevant 
policies, scan networks, and create subnetwork anomaly nodes. It’s a continuous process to perform retrospective 
analysis and help improve models by adjusting parameters. Using Deep Learning Algorithms, attributes are classified 
and stored in a secure database. This repository is used in detecting attacks on online social networks and taking the 
most appropriate actions. Finally, it identifies several unresolved concerns and obstacles that now impede real-world 
implementation and suggests future paths for achieving trustworthiness in online social networks along this dimension. 
270",,"convolutional networks. Despite the fact that multiple solutions to various social network analysis challenges have 
been discovered in recent years, we feel there are still many possible chances worth researching further. Although 
numerous approaches to dealing with dynamic networks have been presented, they all rely on specific assumptions, 
such as assuming that the node set is stable and dealing primarily with dynamism induced by edge deletion and 
addition. Furthermore, past efforts seldom took changes in attribute information into account. As a result, the question 
of how to build effective and efficient network embedding solutions for really dynamic networks is still unresolved.

Abstract 
Due to the fast reduction of natural resources and increasing environmental pollution, the government encourages 
green practices. The government provides subsidy and imposes tax for the use of green and non-green products, 
respectively. A mathematical model has been developed for the price differentiation with demand leakage, greening, 
and sales-effort under deterministic demand for substitute products. In this study, two models (centralized, and 
decentralized) have been examined in the dual-channel supply chain. A Stackelberg game-theoretic approach is 
applied to analyze the decentralized model.

Abstract 
A piston is a reciprocating component of an I.C. engine which converts the chemical energy obtained from combustion 
of fuel into mechanical power. Failure of piston occurs due the induced thermal stresses and the mechanical stresses. 
The main objective of this work is to design a piston and analyze the temperature and stress distribution by performing 
structural analysis and thermal analysis on the piston. The factor of safety is determined for the four materials of 
piston. Modeling of piston is done in Creo parametric 5.0 software. The structural s and thermal analysis of piston is 
performed using ANSYS workbench and the factor of safety is determined. By determining the factor of safety of the 
materials, the material with highest factor of safety is to be used to increase the life of the piston.

1. Introduction
Piston is one of the mechanical components, invented by German scientist Nicholas August Otto in the year 1866. 
Piston is considered to be one of the most important part in a reciprocating Engine, reciprocating pumps, gas 
compressors and pneumatic cylinders, among the other similar mechanisms in which it helps to convert the chemical 
energy obtained by the combustion of fuel into useful mechanical power. A piston is a reciprocating component of an 
engine which is used to convert the chemical energy obtained by the combustion of fuel into mechanical power. The 
purpose of the piston is to transfer the energy to crankshaft via connecting rod. In the working condition piston produce 
the stress and deformation due to periodic load effect which produce from high gas pressure, high speed reciprocating 
motion of the inertia force and lateral pressure. In an I.C. engine, during the combustion stroke the fuel gets ignited. 
During the combustion process, high pressure and high temperature are developed in the engine cylinder. By the 
chemical reaction of burning the gas and high temperature generated make the piston expand and induces thermal 
stress and results in thermal deformation. The thermal and mechanical stresses cause deformation and also the piston 
cracks. This thermal deformation and mechanical deformation results in failure of piston. Therefore, it is very essential 
to analyse the stress distribution, thermal load, mechanical load in order to minimize the mechanical stresses and 
thermal stresses and increase the efficiency of the piston  
1.1 Objectives 
The objectives of this research work are to design a piston according to the design standards and perform structural 
and thermal analysis on the piston for four materials and determine the induced stresses and total deformation in 
materials of piston and finally determine the factor of safety for each material. 
2. Literature Review
Viswanath investigate and analyze the stress distribution of the piston. Design and analysis of a piston using four 
different materials is carried out in the work. Materials like Ti-6Al-4V, Al alloy 4032, Copper, Al alloy 2024 are used 
for structural and thermal analysis of the piston. Applied the pressure as 13.6 MPa and temperature of 1500 degree 
centigrade on the piston head. Kashyap used FEA in research to describe the stress distribution. The mesh optimization 
is described in this study, which uses a finite element analysis technique to anticipate the component's greater stress 
and critical region. The piston head, as well as the piston skirt and sleeve, is optimized to reduce stress concentration. 
Pachpande analysis is carried out on aluminum alloy structural and thermal analysis of piston. In this work the value 
of displacement, stresses have been found out. Kunal study deals with the various loads which are acting on piston.

6. Conclusion  
From the experiments it has been concluded that the piston made of Aluminium Alloy 2024 and Phosphor Bronze 
have better factor of safety and thus can be more efficient during the working. So, by choosing Aluminium Alloy 2024 
and Phosphor Bronze as material for the manufacturing of piston the life span and efficiency of piston can be improved. 
The total deformation occurred for a phosphor bronze piston is very less i.e., 0.35mm and the deformation for 
Aluminium Alloy 2024 is 0.52mm. The factor of safety of Phosphor Bronze piston obtained is 7.28 and the factor of 
safety of Aluminium Alloy 2024 is 7.20. Hence by using Phosphor Bronze or Aluminium Alloy 2024 the efficiency 
of piston can be improved. 
 
Future scope of work 
The same work is extended with above materials under fatigue loading conditions.

Abstract 
When Subsea equipment (MEG Filter and Back Pressure Regulator) is damaged, the overall system is need to retrieved 
and taken to the offshore rig platform for replacement of Subsea equipment. This process usually takes 72-96 hours. 
During the removal of Subsea equipment, the process is disrupted and removal of subsea equipment using 
conventional retrieval tools is difficult due to absence of lifting arrangements and the tools may damage. Moreover, 
the process is need to stopped during retrieval. To get the better of these difficulties and reduce the breakdown time 
of production, a special Subsea Skid for Component Deployment frame is designed. The SSCD frame carries the 
Subsea components like Back pressure regulator and MEG Filter from Offshore rig to the Sea bed where the 
production process is going on. The main aim of this study is to analyze the SSCD frame for structural stability under 
various loading conditions. The time required to replace the damaged component with new component is 3 to 4 hours 
by this SSCD frame. The components are manipulated with the help of Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs). Thus, with 
the help of this frame the components can be safely deployed to the production system with minimum time, cost & 
damage.

1. Introduction
Subsea component Deployment system deploys Subsea components into Seabed where the process is going on. It can 
emplace large equipment into larger depths. The main aim of subsea component deployment systems is to safely 
emplace and place the subsea components considering the Mortal safety with low cost. In general, any operation 
performed in fluidic terrain which is out of reach for manual intervention, requires one or further tools installed there 
within that work in an automatic mode. A suitable illustration of such a terrain is aquatic terrain, and more particularly, 
subsea terrain. Subsea generally refers to outfit, technology used for aquatic operations similar as scientific study of 
organisms in the ocean, geological oceanography, Coastal canvas and gas production and aquatic mining. Generally, 
reclamation tools are used for subsea intervention, wherein permanently installed subsea component is recaptured for 
conditioning using the reclamation tools. Generally, component deployment system is used to emplace and handle the 
installed subsea component. Back pressure regulators are used as subsea component which sucks the gas from the 
seabed. A production system in subsea consists of a subsea tree, subsea completed well and wellhead systems, subsea 
tie-in to inflow line system, jumpers, umbilical and riser system and subsea equipment to operate the well (Figure 1).

the yield strength of the material (250 MPa). 
4.1 Validation 
The SSCD frame will have different stress values during each case. The maximum and minimum values of stress are 
shown in figures with the help of probes. In Ansys, the intensity of the design parameter is represented with some 
colours. Each colour will have some magnitude of stress. In all the cases, stress induced in the SSCD frame to the 
applied weights is less than the Yield strength of the material. Hence, the stresses induced are within the safe limit 
which is represent by blue and green colours. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The study on the SSCD frame which is used for deploying the Subsea Equipment led to the following conclusions: 
 The SSCD frame is checked for Structural stability under various loading conditions. In each case, the stress 
induced is less than the material strength which is indicated with the bottom colours in the coloured bar in 
analysis figures. Hence the design of SSCD frame is safe.  
 Since, the stresses induced are within the safe limit, we conclude that the SSCD frame can safely carry the 
two components from the Offshore rig to the Production system under the sea. 
 As discussed before conventional retrieval process usually takes 74 to 92 hours. Now, by using the SSCD 
Frame the retrieval process takes 4 to 5 hours. 
 The production process needs to be stopped until the maintenance work is completed, this increases the 
production cost. As the retrieval process time is less with the help of SSCD Frame, the cost can be reduced.

Abstract 
The objective is to design and fabricate a washing machine. The Pedal washing machine is a product that can wash 
clothes without using electrical energy. The aim is to produce device to washcloths that can be run without using of 
electrical power. The various parts used for making a power-operated washing machine can quickly available in the 
market at a cheap cost and it requires less maintenance. It consists of various components i.e, outer drum (fabricated 
using MS sheet), internal drum (SS sheet), stainless steel shaft, frame(MS angular bar), bearings, chain sprocket, 
seat, and pedal arrangement. Initially, individual various components need to be drawn in CATIA and need to 
assemble the components for obtaining the final product design. Once the design is done each individual component 
can be fabricated based on the required dimensions. The outer drum and inner drum, the frame is fabricated by doing 
mechanical activities rolling, welding, cutting, shearing, riveting, and grinding activities. Rolling is performed for 
obtaining a cylindrical shape drum. welding is done to assemble components together. Shearing is performed to 
remove excess material. Drilling is performed for producing holes. Grinding is performed for good surface finishing 
at sharp covers and at the welded area and also for cutting of material to obtain the required dimensions. Finally, all 
the individual fabricated components are assembled together for obtaining the final product. When a person starts 
pedaling the cycle by applying load on the pedal transmission of energy takes place from the pedal to the inner drum 
shaft. as we placed the clothes in the inner drum when it rotates the washing of clothes can be done. By employing 
pedal washing machines in rural and tribal areas, peoples can wash their clothes easily without having a burden, by 
applying less effort to the pedal.

1. Introduction
The main objective of this research is to reduce strenuous work of people who are living in rural area and tribal areas 
where there is lack of electricity. By employing pedal operated washing machine, energy used for washing cloths 
can be reduced, therefore people need to apply less effort for washing cloths instead of manual washing. In some 
countries people who are migrated to various places, people use to give their cloths for laundry for washing, with the 
help of pedal operated washing machine both washing cloths and fitness is done. The main mechanism is when the 
load is applied on the pedal by human is converted in rotary motion. The pedal operated washing machine is cost 
effective and can be used without electricity, maintenance cost is also less 
Main objectives are: 
- RINSING, WASHING, SPINNING can be done.
- Low cost of maintanence & Can wash various clothes effectively & Fittness can be maintained.
- Low operating cost & Less human effort is required to wash clothes & cloths can washed without
electricity.
2. Methodology
The method are as follows (Figure 1 and 2).

and 2. Same principle applies with the spinning operation as well. Time of operation is directly proportional to the 
load present in the machine, but it requires more speed when compared to washing operation. 
 
9. Scope for Future work 
1. Energy conservation:  
Flywheel is installed in the model stores the energy that is produced in surplus than required. It is 
advantageous for the cyclist, as it reuses the energy during the further operation.  
 
2. Expansion of machine capacity:  
Increasing the machine capacity may be advantageous in reducing the time of washing operation. But, it 
doesn’t work well in case of spinning operation. Damage of drum may occur if the spinning is done with 
higher loads. It should be done in turns to prevent damage to the machine.  
 
3. Multi purpose design:  
Charging of batteries, powering of pedal operated equipment like wood cutting machine, circular saw, 
winnowing can be done with the generated excessive energy instead of sending it to fly wheel. 
10. Conclusion 
In the view of rural areas and the places where there is scarcity of electrical energy, a pedal powered washing 
machine is designed. The apparatus and equipment used for the design and assembly are economical and easily 
available. It satisfies the costeffective design as pedal operated washing machine wholly fabricated at a cost of 
around Rs. 5000/- INR, that is cheaper than a low end electrical washing machine available. It also has the 
advantages of less maintenance and operating cost, easy operation, environment friendly, moreover it helps in 
maintaining the physical fitness of the user.

Abstract 
Solar energy is abundant and may be easily collected using solar cells and solar panels that are maintained on a 
regular basis. However, variables like as panel orientation, shading, wind speed, ambient temperature, 
precipitation, and dust deposition all impact solar cell efficiency, which is already poor. The maintenance of solar 
panels is difficult due to soiling. To remove the material that has collected on the panels, manual and water-based 
cleaning treatments are commonly utilised. A complete analysis of soiling avoidance approaches is offered in this 
research with the goal of increasing solar panel energy collection. Following that, the technical specifics of an 
indigenously created automated water-free cleaning mechanism for removing soiling from solar panels are 
explained. The energy collection for PV panels cleaned using an automated solar panel cleaning solution over the 
course of a month is compared to the energy capture for filthy panels in a local solar panel installation, and the 
enhanced yield is calculated.

1. Introduction
The accumulation of dust on the surfaces of photovoltaic modules reduces the solar cell's incoming irradiance, 
obscures solar flux, and results in power loss. According to studies conducted in arid places, these losses might 
amount to up to 15% of total generation capacity each day. Water-based cleaning is expensive in large-scale PV 
systems, especially when water is scarce. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are predicted to provide 25% of the 
world's total electrical power demands, however they are more likely to be found in non-agricultural, semi-arid, 
and desert areas. According to projections, the whole world energy demand can be satisfied with close to zero 
CO2 emissions even if PV facilities are installed in only 4% of the net feasible dry regions. 
Cleaning solar photovoltaic panels requires autonomous solutions because manual and semi-automated cleaning 
methods use excessive amounts of water and are labour intensive, reducing their cost effectiveness and 
environmental friendliness. The use of an electrodynamic screen (EDS) atop a PV panel to remove dust using an 
electric field created by a high voltage supply to the EDS electrodes is described further. Due to their hefty weights 
and uneconomical services, these screens may not always be effective, lowering commercial viability. 
2. Solar energy generation
In 2007, global solar PV market installations reached a new high of 5.95GW (Figure 1). By 2017, China will have 
reclaimed the total annual PV demand lead. Solar power could account for 11% of global electricity production 
by 2050 and 60% by 2100, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) (Kaliappan et al., 2004). China's 
photovoltaic business is developing at a quicker rate than any other country on the planet. In 2016, solar PV 
accounted for 43.3 percent of newly installed renewable energy capacity. China had the largest PV market, with 
77.5GW of installed capacity (Yang et al., 2003). The theoretical reserves of worldwide solar Photovoltaic 
resources total 208 EWh/a, according to estimates based on global horizontal irradiance statistics for solar energy. 
Africa is the continent with the highest TR 63,505.48 PWh/a, which accounts for 31% of the global total (Tang et 
al., 2003).

1. Introduction
India is one of the top most countries in the automotive industry in the world having a large population of nearly 15 
million. For travelling from one place to another, people are adopted to use 2-and 3-wheelers which results in a great 
amount of pollution causing the environmental problems. Most of the companies are extracting more amount of fossil 
fuels for their economic growth and productivity. Due to this petrol prices are also increased by more than half of their 
existing cost in the last few years. In order to decrease these drawbacks and to protect the renewable sources, an alternative 
came into existence known as the Electric vehicle (EV). The initial investment may be higher than conventional engines, 
but considering the present situation, it is preferable to develop electric vehicles. Compared to conventional vehicles, 
electric vehicles have more advantages and have a huge impact on the future. In General gasoline vehicles have tailpipe 
which produces emissions into the air, and poisonous gases which causes many health issues like respiratory problems, 
irritations, etc. 
Coming to the paper, presents the design and development of an electric moped chassis. In brief, all components of EV 
are discussed and a new chassis is designed and analysed. Before that one has to know about the basic definition of an 
Electric vehicle and why it is developed. An electric vehicle also referred to as an electric drive vehicle uses one or more 
motors for the propulsion. An electric vehicle may be charged through an external system or may be powered by a battery 
replacing the fuel tank in a gasoline vehicle. The EV became famous by three important factors: Advancement in battery 
technologies, encouragement by the government through policies and schemes for the reduction of air pollution, to 
decrease the petroleum usage as they are diminishing.  Electric vehicles are used for road transportation like short distance 
applications like online deliveries. They are also applicable for rail, underwater and aerospace. 
EVs are arisen in the mid19th century when electrical energy is mostly preferred for providing ease of operation and 
comfort for the person who is using it. As days are passing by, global warming and pollution are increasing gradually. 
Electric vehicles development will be more useful for the future generation. The paper describes the new chassis 
developed for the EV.  
The 2-wheeler chassis is comprised of a few components. They are wheels, brakes and suspension. The main component 
of a vehicle is Chassis. It acts as a skeleton for the vehicle where the parts of the EV are mounted. For the fabrication of 
chassis materials like steel, aluminium or any alloy can be used. The chassis should be torsion-resistant that it shouldn’t 
bend or buckle on uneven road surfaces which may be harmful to the person who is driving. Mostly the frame is made of 
hollow tubes of different materials. The Components mentioned above are discussed in the following sections.  
1.1 Objectives 
1. To validate the chassis like stress analysis and loading conditions, suggesting the design rules based on the output.
2. Identifying all mechanical properties of chassis and studying various loading conditions.
2. Literature review
K.W.E Cheng (2009) ellaborates recent Development on Electric Vehicles, International Conference on Power 
Electronics Systems and Applications. The paper describes the development and the comparison of different part of 
components. The major components in battery technology, charger design, motor, steering and braking are examined.[1]

6. Conclusion 
1) Chassis is designed and developed considering the boundary conditions.  
2) The allowable stress for MS steel is around 230MPA and maximum stress obtained in the analysis is 27.7MPA which 
proves that the design is safe.  
3) As steel is used for fabrication it increased the manufacturability of pipes when welding is in process due its strength. 
4) At various loading conditions the chassis is  analysed giving a expected output.  
 
7. Scope for Future Work 
1.The designed chassis can be used to manufacture the electric vehicle. 
2. For further work the chassis can be modified based on the components used for the production of electric moped.

Abstract 
This paper consists of designing of nine speed gearbox and the procedure for calculating the number of teeth on gear 
including structure and ray diagram. For analysis, the gearbox assembly is created in CATIA and Analysis is 
performed in ANSYS. Also, deformation is attained as the gear efficiency depends on the deformation. A 
mechanical device called a gearbox that transforms the torque and speed of a rotary power generator to the output 
shaft. The torque transferred reduces when there is a rise in shaft speed, and likewise. Multi-speed gearboxes are 
utilized in cases where the speed or the torque there at the output shaft must be varied often. Gearboxes operate on 
the idea of teeth meshing, resulting in power transfer and the motion transfer from the input source toward the 
outputs. To achieve the needed speed differences, a gearbox is constructed by attaching several gears in a proper 
speed ratio. Gearboxes often feature many groups of gears that are strategically arranged to achieve various speed 
variations. The synchromesh, sliding mesh, and constant mesh gearboxes are the three kinds of gearboxes. Sliding 
and stationary gears are the two main types of gears in a sliding mesh gearbox. Sliding gears are installed on splined 
shafts so that they may move along the shaft's axis and mesh with possible combinations of gear. The result shows 
that the deformation, maximum stresses and elastic strain are under safe limits. 
Keywords: Gearbox with Nine speeds, 3D modeling, simulation, gear tooth, analysis of gearbox. 
1. Introduction
The basic function of a gearbox is to transfer power out of a power supply to the intended output component as per 
varying requirements. A gearbox is a device that converts the torque and speed of a rotary power supply to the 
output shaft. The torque transferred will reduces when shaft speed rises, and likewise. Multi-speed gearboxes are 
utilized in situations where the speed or the torque at the output shaft must be changed often. Gearboxes function on 
the concept of teeth meshing, which leads to motion and power transfer from the input to the output. A transmission 
or gearbox uses gear ratios to convert speed and torque from a rotary power supply toward another device. The 
transmission shifts the greater engine speed to the slower wheel speed, thus improving torque. Multiple gear ratios 
are available in transmission, with the option to move around them as there is a difference in speed. This can be 
accomplished either by hand or automatedly. Control in both directions (forward and backward) may be available. 
Most contemporary gearboxes are designed to improve torque by lowering the speed of a prime mover output shaft, 
resulting in mechanical gain and an improvement in torque. Uses of a gearbox: Gearboxes have been applied for 
altering the direction in which power is transferred, altering the level of force or torque that is delivered, and 
adjusting the relative speed of the input compared to the output, along with other functions. 
1.1 Objectives 
The main aim of this work is to design the multi speed gear box. To control the experimental set up cost, a 
numerical approach was planned. A structure analysis is considered as same as the real time experimental set up. For 
Design the individual gear model, Table 2 designing data is used. Using this constant profile shape, 3D model of the 
Gears are prepared with Catia software

6. Conclusion
Lastly, it concluded that as per the design criteria, it has designed the gearbox and the design made by us is safe and 
satisfactory and can be proceeded with the production process. Also, the stepwise solution of the present work 
would be beneficial as per an aspect of time and reducing complexity for designing the gearbox. The ray diagrams 
are used to make the design more feasible concerning the number of teeth used in gearbox and transmission ratio. 
The analysis shows that the gearbox can carry maximum stresses and deformation under the safety zone. Based on 
the results, spur gear with a higher module is preferred if a large amount of power is required to transmit.

Abstract 
A wheelchair is an assistive technology that helps individuals who are unable to move normally owing to injury or 
other age-related walking impairments (permanent or under treatment). All electric wheelchairs are quite costly and 
not affordable. Availability of all electric wheelchair will improve the quality of life of the disabled. To make the 
Electric wheelchair available at lower cost, the possibility of retrofitting a wheelchair is investigated. 24V 13.4A 
BLDC motors are used and controllers are modified. Speed control is achieved using Arduino, Joystick and L293N 
motor drivers. Retrofitting an existing wheelchair into an electric wheelchair will take care of the ergonomics as well 
as all the norms in designing the wheelchair. The retrofitted wheelchair successfully carried a 100kg person at a speed 
of 20kmph.

1. Introduction
The percentage of the population with physical disabilities has grown in importance, drawing the attention of 
worldwide health-care organizations, institutions, and businesses interested in inventing and adopting new goods. The 
actual trend reflects a demand for greater health and rehabilitation services, so that senior and disabled people can 
become more independent in doing daily duties. Mobility is a fundamental quality of all humans, irrespective of age. 
Children with disabilities are frequently denied key opportunities and endure significant disadvantages in comparison 
to their peers. Adults who lose their autonomous mode of transportation become less self-sufficient, resulting in a 
negative attitude toward them. Loss of movement creates impediments to achieving personal and professional goals. 
As a result, solutions to assist this demographic group must be developed in order to ensure the elderly and 
handicapper’s comfort and independence. For those people, wheelchairs are essential modes of transportation. As per 
the article published in Global News Wire (Market_Researhc_Future, 2022), a record growth rate of 6.7% in electric 
wheelchair utilization is predicted till 2027 in US. Artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy logic are

5. Conclusions 
Electric wheelchairs are quite costly are far from reach to the middle class. This paper details how a normal wheel 
chair can be retrofitted to an electric wheel chair and how the stock controller can be rigged to be controlled using 
Arduino. The overall cost of the project (for retrofitting) is around Rs. 25000/- which is almost 1/3rd of the general 
cost of a electric wheel chair in market. The only drawback, which is still desirable, is that high speed drives are not 
possible with this wheel chair. The electric wheel chair developed is manual. Since Arduino controller is used, it is 
open source and thus other assistive technologies can be further implemented to make this semi- and fully autonomous.

Abstract 
A simple yet precise solar position measuring system is required to maximize the output power of a solar panel in 
order to boost panel efficiency while lowering system costs. Solar position may be monitored using either an 
active/passive sensor or the sun position monitoring algorithm. Sensor-based sun position measurement devices 
do not accurately estimate the solar position on a cloudy or intermittent day, and they need precise installation 
and periodic calibrations. A dual axis solar tracking system is used in this project to gather solar energy. Solar 
trackers are used to significantly increase the electric output of a photovoltaic panel. The solar tracking system 
consists of a primary solar panel and four guided panels behind it, two of which are linked to opposing polarities 
of a horizontal motor and two further panels are connected to opposing polarities of a vertical motor. When the 
angle of the sun's rays changes, the rays fall on the guided panel, allowing the motor to adjust the angle to 
maximize intensity. Hence, the solar tracking efficiency is improvised. 
Keywords 
Tracking, efficiency, electric power, motor and intensity. 
1. Introduction
There is a great deal of energy in the sun's core. The energy obtained from the sun in an hour exceeds the energy 
expended by people in a working year (Rubio et al., 2006). If humans can gather even a fraction of the energy that 
we receive from solar radiation, we will be able to fulfil the demands of our species for an extremely long time 
(Hossein et al. 2009). Efforts are constantly made to obtain the greatest amount of energy in order to store the 
bulk of the energy that we get (Hunter, 2001). Solar thermal energy systems for local hot water and solar systems 
for micro-electricity generation are driving the increased interest in using renewable energies for detached 
structures (Abdullah et al., 2004). A solar tracker is a device that orients a payload toward the sun (Peng et al., 
2013). The use of solar trackers can be able to increase power production by around a third, compared with 
modules at a fixed angle (Mereddy et al., 2015). The conversion efficiency is improved when the modules are 
continually adjusted to the optimum angle as the sun traverses the sky (Wu et al., 2008). To maximum power 
output from solar panels, the panels must be kept aligned with the sun (Hoffman et al., 1997). According to various 
studies, a dual axis solar tracking system boosts energy production by around 40% (Hossein et al., 2009). 
2. Classification
There are two major types of Solar Tracking systems and are distinguished by the way they move in the number 
of axis (Yousuf et al., 2009). 
1. The Single Axis solar tracking system tracks the sun from east to west rotating on a single point moving
either in unison, by panel row or by section.
2. Dual Axis solar trackers rotate on both the x and y axes and track the sun for east to west and as well as from
north to south making the panels track the sun in all directions directly (Masoud et al., 2015).

Figure 5. Voltage vs Time of Solar Panel with Tracking 
Figure 5. shows the graph for a dual axis tracking PV panel drawn between time on x-axis and voltage output on 
y-axis. It shows that the maximum output voltage is obtained amlost throughout the day.
Figure 6. Comparision between Dual axis tracking and without tracking 
Figure 6. shows the comparison between the voltages while using dual axis tracking and the fixed panel. It shows 
that dual axis solar tracking is more efficient as compared to the fixed solar panel. 
6. Conclusion
Dual axis solar tracking tracks the sun in both the axis, east to west and north to south . The results obtained 
between static fixed solar panel and the dual axis tracker has come to a conclusion stating that the dual axis solar 
tracking improves the efficiency of the PV panel . These panels change their orientation in relation to solar 
radiation to increase the efficiency and results in maximum production of energy and helps in getting full benefit 
of optimal angle between solar panels and solar radiations .

The goals of this project were outlined keeping in mind the timeline and resources that ere attainable. However, 
this initial design can be subjected to many improvements. Initially this design represents a miniature scale model, 
which can be modified into a much larger scale. Easy to bend cables can be used which do not apply any force on 
the motor when it is rotating the solar panel. 
•
The dual axis solar tracking can implemented in large-scale solar arrays to improve the power generation
efficiency (Piao et al., 2005).
•
Tracking system can also be used in domestic solar water heating systems (Masoud et al., 2009).
•
Tracking system can also be implemented in solar collectors and thermosiphon systems
•
Implementation of this tracking system in large scale can be done in a very less cost and economic manner

Abstract 
Due to the excellent strength and stiffness to weight ratio, composite materials are widely used in many technical 
applications. The goal is to compare the stresses, deformations, and weight savings of steel and composite leaf springs. 
Stiffness is a design restriction. Because composite materials have a high strength-to-weight ratio and strong corrosion 
resistance, the automobile industry is very interested in replacing steel leaf springs with composite leaf springs. When 
compared to standard steel, the material chosen was glass fibre reinforced polymer (E-glass/epoxy). The design 
parameters were chosen and examined with the goal of reducing the composite leaf spring's weight in comparison to the 
steel leaf spring. Steel replacement is a hot topic in the automotive industry.and also Glass fibre reinforced polymer (E-
glass/epoxy) was chosen as a replacement for traditional steel. The design parameters were chosen and examined with 
the goal of reducing the composite leaf spring's weight in comparison to the steel leaf spring. The automobile industry 
is very interested in steel replacement.

1. Introduction
A leaf spring, also known as a laminated or carriage spring, is a simple type of spring that is widely used for suspension 
in wheeled vehicles. It's also one of the oldest springing techniques, dating back to the Middle Ages. The advantage of 
a leaf spring over a helical spring is that the springs' ends can be steered along a predetermined path. It is a narrow arc-
shaped length of spring steel with a rectangular cross-section that is sometimes referred to as a semi-elliptical spring 
or cart spring. The axle is located in the centre of the arc, and tie holes are supplied on both ends for attachment to the 
vehicle body. A leaf spring can be attached to the frame at both ends or at one end, generally the front, with the other 
end attached through a shackle, a short swinging arm. The shackle compensates for the leaf spring's inclination to 
stretch when squeezed, resulting in gentler springness. There were several types of leaf springs, most of which used 
the term ""elliptical."" Two circular arcs joined at their tips were referred to as ""elliptical"" or ""complete elliptical"" leaf 
springs. The top centre of the upper arc was attached to the frame, while the bottom centre was attached to the ""live"" 
suspension components, such as a solid front axle. Additional suspension components, such as trailing arms, would be 
needed for this design, but not for ""semi-elliptical"" leaf springs as used in the Hotchkiss drive. That employed the lower 
arc, hence its name. ""Quarter-elliptic"" springs often had the thickest part of the stack of leaves stuck into the rear end 
of the side pieces of a short ladder frame, with the free end attached to the differential, as in the Austin Seven of the 
1920s. As an example of non-elliptic leaf springs, the Ford Model T had multiple leaf springs over its differential that 
was curved in the shape of a yoke. As a substitute for dampers (shock absorbers), some manufacturers laid nonmetallic 
sheets in between the metal leaves, such as wood. 
1.1 Objectives   
The main objective of this research is to carry analysis of leaf spring by selecting different materials and selecting a 
material good load carrying properties to avoid ground contacting of leaf spring at higher loads.

6. Conclusion   
1. Total deformation,equivalent elastic strain,equivalentstress,strainenergy,and mass results have    been 
analysed for various material combinations in various leaf spring design cases.   
2. For each design case, a static analysis of the leaf spring was performed using different material    
combinations under similar loading conditions.   
3. For all leaf spring design cases, results for selected parameters are obtained.   
4. The results are examined for the five parameters listed above. Design case D2 has been determined to be 
optimal for total deformation, equivalent elastic strain, equivalent (Von-Mises) stress, strain energy, and 
mass optimization.   
5. For meshing and analysis of leaf springs, ANSYS 14.0 is used. This method of analysis is less expensive, 
more efficient, and takes less time than other methods of solution.

Abstract 
The goal is to learn more about how a geometric gap between a cylindrical or spherical shell and a reinforcing pad 
influences stress intensity at the nozzle penetration while the pressure vessel is under internal pressure. In a number 
of tanks, pressure vessels, and other vessels, nozzles serve as the input and outflow for process and cooling fluid. 
Various applications such as heat exchangers to make the Nozzle hole in the shell, the shell strength may be 
lowered. To boost strength and prevent failure, a reinforcement pad is used at the nozzle junction. As a result, the 
shell nozzle. A multitude of factors are considered when determining whether or not a pad is necessary at the 
junction. If a pad is needed, the thickness and diameter are estimated using ASME standards. The stress created at 
the junction is also calculated using a finite element analysis (FEA) of the junction. The magnitudes and 
distributions of the local stresses induced by the geometric discontinuity and internal pressure loading are thus 
uncertain. For a variety of reasons, perfect contact between the shell and the pad cannot be maintained, resulting in a 
gap. The effect of the gap on the stresses in the nozzle reinforcement region is of interest to both designers and 
manufacturers.

1. Introduction
Pressure vessels, pipe tees, boilers, and reactors are examples of structural design applications where safe and 
affordable design criteria must be met. The most common forms of nozzle connections in many technological 
applications are those subjected to internal pressure and external loads. The application of adequate stress-relieving 
reinforcements is one of the challenges with nozzle connection design. To ensure the safety of nozzle connections, 
many types of connections are used. These connections include welded pad reinforcement, self-reinforced nozzles, 
and internally protruded connectors and toros transitions. A variety of studies have been conducted to examine 
pressure vessel safety under various loading situations due to the relevance of pressure vessels in engineering 
applications and the potential of safety concerns in the case of an accident. There are a variety of codes that detail 
the rules and regulations that must be followed to ensure that equipment is constructed safely. Extensive study has 
been done on the stresses surrounding nozzle connectors. It is possible to correctly analyze stresses at cylindrical 
connections in order to ensure a safe and cost-effective design. Traditional pressure vessel design regulations, such 
as ASME Section VIII, cannot accommodate all design scenarios. The Code, for example, does not address external 
stresses on nozzles. In such cases, engineers must deviate from the Code and apply recognized design procedures 
such as finite element analysis (FEA). WRC 107/297, as well as other simplified calculation techniques used in the 
PVP industry, are based on limited test data and have geometric constraints. The findings become erroneous if 
certain geometric limitations are not followed. There are no limitations to finite element analysis, and it can provide 
correct findings in any case. 
1.1 Objectives  
The main aim of this work is to Design and Analysis of Reinforcement pad at Nozzle junction on Pressure Vessel. 
To do the Analysis part perfectly, firstly we have to design complete assembly of pressure vessel with reinforcement

By this above calculations (Table 1) we say that, by keeping the RF Pad at nozzle junction is safe for pressure vessel 
and by these values we say that, the Total Deformation has been reduced by 6.17% , Equivalent stress has been 
reduced by 27.49% , Equivalent elastic strain has been reduced by 29.66% by keeping RF Pad.  
 
6. Conclusions  
A pressure vessel's Design Pressure, Design Temperature and component dimension are all designed according to 
ASME pressure vessel specifications. Under various loads, the pressure vessel's Reinforcement pads, shell, Blind 
Flange and Shell junction area were examined using FEA and ASME methodologies. The material's allowable stress 
is less than the stress equivalent and pressure vessel component stress classification lines. The analysis conclusions for 
the normal operating state were within acceptable bounds. As a consequence, the current Reinforcement pads, shell, 
Blind Flange and Shell junction area designs are capable of sustaining the desired load conditions. The pressure 
vessels are designed to be safe. The level of safety that we consider acceptable and by which we judge the design to be 
safe. The bursting pressure is below the design's permissible stress, ensuring that it does not fail. And because the 
analysis is so near to the analytical design, both the data and the design are regarded safe. In addition, no pressure 
vessel failures have occurred. By incorporating the RF pad the von-mises stresses are reduced by 27.49%, Total 
deformation are reduced by 6.17%, Equivalent elastic strain has been reduced by 29.66%.

1. Introduction
Drone technology is now a big investment area where a successful project can easily attract investments. The 
application of the drones are in varied dimensions, which include videography, goods delivery, surveillance etc. 
Application of delivery drones right now can be clearly seen in international border scenarios. But use of drone 
for delivery of packages with in cities is till under investigation. Thus, this area is choosen as the problem in the 
current work. The aim is to design a drone that can deliver a package weighing around 3kgs. Drones are unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAVs) and they are also called multirotor or multi-copter.  There are different types of multi-
copters or UAVs such as dual copters, tri-copters, quadcopters, and hex-copters. Due to their construction and 
ease-of-use drones can be easily deployable and deliver products to remote locations and they are widely used in 
many applications. A Quadcopter drone has four motors that are used to lift the drone and it uses fixed patch

7. Conclusion
The use of light materials in the device's design allows the quadcopter drone to fly fast to its goal. The design and 
assembly of a quadcopter are explained in depth in this publication. Additive manufacturing is used to create 
quadcopter components. The components were designed in Fusion 350 and then 3D printed. The document 
includes a list of electronic components and their specs that were used in the fabrication process. An APM flight 
controller provides control. The drone is more stable, and it can also fly on its own and use GPS to return to its 
launch location. The quadcopter can deliver tiny items such as drugs, food, and other supplies to remote locations.

Abstract 
The mechanical properties of egg-shell (ES)/ Aluminium (Al) composites have been studied. In the present work, the 
egg-shell reinforced composites were prepared via stir casting at a temperature of 700 oC. The higher relative density 
varied in the range between ~87% to ~95% through stir casting technique and the densification of Alumnium 
composites reduced with the egg-shell powder addition. The hardness of composites (BHN: 99.8) increased by adding 
the ES powder upto 3 wt.%. The tensile strength of the composites increased upto 3 wt.% and further decreased with 
the addition of reinforcement. The impact strength of the ES/Al composites enhanced to 30 KJ/m2.

1. Introduction
A composite is a structural material that consists of two or more combined constituents that are combined at a 
macroscopic level and are not soluble in each other. One constituent is called the reinforcing phase and the one in 
which it is embedded is called the matrix. The reinforcing phase material may be in the form of fibers, particles, or 
flakes. The matrix phase materials are generally continuous. Examples of composite systems include concrete 
reinforced with steel and epoxy reinforced with graphite fibers etc.  
They are composed of a metallic matrix (aluminium, magnesium, iron, cobalt, copper) and a dispersed ceramic 
(oxides, carbides) or metallic (lead, tungsten, molybdenum) phase. Examples of matrices in such composites include 
aluminium, magnesium, and titanium. Typical fibers include carbon and silicon carbide. Metals are mainly reinforced 
to increase or decrease their properties to suit the needs of the design. For example, the elastic stiffness and strength 
of metals can be increased and large coefficients of thermal expansion and thermal and electric conductivities of metals 
can be reduced, by the addition of fibers such as silicon carbide. Increasingly found in the automotive industry, these 
materials use a metal such as aluminum as the matrix, and reinforce it with fibers such as silicon carbide. 
1.1 Objectives 
The knowledge gap in the existing literature summarized above has helped to set the objectives of this research work 
which are outlined as follows: 
Preparation of egg-shell reinforced Al composites by stir casting method 
To obtain the high densification of ES/Al composites 
To analyze the mechanical behaviour of composites  
2. Literature Review
Historically, MMCs were among the first continuous-fiber reinforced composites studied as a model system. Initial 
work in the late 1960s was stimulated by the high-performance needs of the aerospace industry. In these development 
efforts, performance, not cost, was the primary driver. Metal-matrix composites (MMCs) have emerged as a class of 
materials capable of advanced structural, aerospace, automotive, electronic, thermal management and wear 
applications.

metal matrix by the stir casting method. Biomass fly ash with different proportions (1%, 3%, 5%, 7%) has been

6. Conclusion
The mechanical properties such as impact strength, tensile strength, hardness as well as density of the composites are 
greatly influenced by the weight percentage of egg-shell powder in the matrix. The aluminium alloy and egg-shell 
powder composites were successfully fabricated by stir casting with different compositions like (0%, 3%, 5% , 7%, 
9%, 11%, 13%) of egg- shell powder. The rise in impact strength value upon increasing the percentage quality of 
egg-shell shell powder upto 5% and decreases if further egg-shell powder is added. Increment in the tensile strength 
has been observed but only up to a certain extent i.e, beyond 5% egg-shell Shell powder, there is a substantial 
reduction in the tensile strength.  
The hardness of composite depends upon the hardness of the reinforcement and matrix. The mixing of egg-shell 
powder less than 5% attains more tensile strength and hardness values. On comparing the impact strength from it 
shows that 3% - 5% of reinforcement of egg-shell powder has good effectiveness of impact strength. In the density 
there is constant decrease in the density as the wt% of egg-shell powder increases. Even though the trends in the 
various tests suggest that Al6061 alloy reinforced with egg-shell is not the way forward, its still serves as a better 
replacement that non reinforced Al6061 alloy. Egg-shell powder can thus be said to have a bright future to function 
as a supplementing reinforcement for the production of low-cost high performance aluminium hybrid composites.

Abstract 
This paper presents the efforts made in the design, fabrication and experimentation to find compressive nature of 
porous triply periodic minimal surface structures made of polylactic acid material in order to determine the 
compressive stress vs strain porous structures fabricated with the fused deposit modeling process for biomedical 
applications. The problem concerned here is the determination of stress-strain graph of structure with INSTRON 
machine. The work is focused on designing the triply periodic minimal surface polylactic acid structure and studying 
the compressive forces of structures. The three-dimensional triply periodic minimal surface-based lattice structures 
with porosity ranging from 10 to 50% porosity were designed, fabricated and experimented. This work establishes 
the appropriate porosity which can handle optimum compressive forces between the implant and the bone by adding 
the porosity to the implant structure.

1. Introduction
Additive manufacturing (AM) is a digital manufacturing technology, rapidly revolutionizing in the medical sectors 
for printing of distinct body parts having intrinsic shapes and offering customized solutions to every patient. In the 
past few decades, AM is used as a versatile and cost-effective method for the manufacturing of geometrically 
complicated shape in the medical industry. In addition, AM technology is used for the development of products from 
dental implants to heart valves and joint replacements etc. This is the technology that makes a physical model 
directly from CAD models by adding materials in layer by layer fashion and offers robust mechanical properties.  
By designing this porous implants and fabricating them to do compressive testing to see whether the implant can 
sustain stresses employed on it by surrounding bones.    
2. Objectives
The main objective of this research is to design such complex structures and converting them to STL files for 3D
printing and in FDM process the complex parts will be printed with support structures and their removal from the
actual print is tricky and finally these porous parts will be compressive force experimented on INSTRON machine to
find the compressive forces employed by surrounding bones during load applications. So here we find the optimum
porosity implant which can handle high compressive forces and terminating stress shielding.
3. Literature Review
Xiaojian Wang et al. (2020) said the study of critical issues in orthopedic regenerative medicine is the design of 
bone scaffolds and implants that replicate the bio-mechanical properties of the host bones. Porous metals have found 
themselves to be suitable candidates for repairing or replacing the damaged bones since their stiffness and porosity 
can be adjusted on demands. Another advantage of porous metals lies in their open space for the in-growth of bone 
tissue, hence accelerating the osseointegration process. The fabrication of porous metals has been extensively

7. Proposed Improvements
As all specimens has undergone compressive testing with the help of INSTRON equipment to find out the optimum
level of porosity structure within the 15 specimens by applying compressive forces on them because this structures
when they will be implanted in human bodies between the natural. These lightweight structures have high weight to
strength ratio over conventional materials. These materials exhibit high thermal and electrical conductivity, low
density, high flexibility and excellent heat and corrosion resistant properties.
By comparing above lattice structure tables and graphs we find that:
Gyroid with 20%, 30% have maximum compressive load & high compressive strength. 
Diamond with 10%, 20% have maximum compressive load & high compressive strength. 
Primitive with 10%, 30% have maximum compressive load & high compressive strength. 
In the above three types, Gyroid with 20% porosity is the optimum structure have maximum load carrying 
capacity with low strain rate and high compressive strength 
8. Conclusion
Additive manufacturing technologies are useful for producing the biomedical components. Use of porous implants 
reduces the mismatch of elastic modulus between implant and bone; this avoids disassociation of implant with bone. 
Avoids joint loosening, properly fixation of joint, helps for bone formation and in growth of bone. Therefore, porous 
implant instead of dense implant improves patient quality of life then this testing helps us to identify the structure 
which has better load carrying and less strain so that the optimum structure will be chosen and porous/holes help in 
bone integration and material used PLA will overcome the metallic implant challenges.

Maximum stress that a strut stabilizer assembly can withstand is 208.43Mpa
FUTURE SCOPE 
If implemented, it will greatly contribute to prevent side to side or move up and down movement of 
hitching equipment when it is in motion. Consequently, avoid the crop damage and also prevent 
tractor deflect from its path by reducing high impacts on tractor. Thus increases work efficiency.  
CONCLUSION 
The three-point hitch is a widely used type of hitch for attaching ploughs and other implements to 
an agricultural or industrial tractor. Three-point attachment is the simplest and the only statically 
determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering. The parts of strut stabilizer undergo different 
manufacturing processes like shot blasting, facing, turning, drilling, blanking, tapping, welding, 
hardening, tempering and plating. These individual parts go through some inspection processes like 
income quality inspection, in-process inspection and microstructure inspection. Therefore, 
manufactured products can withstand several attributes like high stress, temperature, pressure and 
strain. It can assemble and disassemble easily. Since, product is manufactured using cast iron it can 
withstand high load conditions. Average loading conditions on strut stabilizer is 48.303Mpa. 
Maximum stress that strut stabilizer assembly can withstand is 208.43Mpa. Therefore, strut stabilizer 
helps the tractor by increasing its stability while working and helps in better outcomes.

Abstract 
Modern engineering courses provide students with exposure to the theory and derivations of problems. In order for 
future engineers to effectively prepare to apply their engineering education to problems in industry, it is vital that 
engineering students take courses in which they can learn how to integrate different engineering topics and apply 
theoretical knowledge to industry problems. The objective of this project is to develop an educational platform that both 
integrates and applies the knowledge that a mechanical engineering student learns during their undergraduate career i.e 
design and fabrication aspects of a 3D printed robotic arm. Also require knowledge and integration of mechanical 
engineering, mechatronics, programming and manufacturing principles and will require students to explore and 
integrate knowledge from various engineering disciplines, including dynamics (forward and inverse kinematics), stress 
and strain analysis, FEA and topology optimization, mechatronics

Abstract 
This study will aid in successfully adopting Blockchain Technology (BCT) and its applications in financial systems. 
The research aims to explain the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and impediments or barriers that may arise with 
BCT adoption in financial services. To develop the theoretical framework, the identified CSFs and barriers were 
grouped and analyzed along different dimensions (i.e., Technological, Organizational, Operational, Environment & 
Economic). Smart Contracts, Peer-to-Peer Networks (P2P), Trust, and Security, are identified as CSFs in the 
technical realm. At the same time, Scalability, Fake Identity Threat, and Interoperability are impediments to BCT 
adoption. Under the organizational dimension, Trust Mechanism and Informational Access are highlighted as CSFs, 
whereas Lack of Management Support and Commitment are hurdles to BCT deployment. Decentralization and 
Energy-Intensiveness are identified as CSF and impediments to BCT adoption along the operational dimension. 
Under the economic dimension, financial trust, Fintech disruptions, and Cost-Cutting Measures are identified as 
CSFs. At the same time, High Transaction Prices have been determined as barriers to BCT adoption. Finally, 
Disintermediation and the Absence of Regulations and Laws are identified as CSFs and hurdles to adopting BCT, 
respectively, along the environmental dimension. The developed theoretical model presented in the paper provides a 
practical roadmap for successful BCT adoption in financial services in Indian settings.

Abstract 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are extensively being incorporated by financial institutions, 
operating in both the public and private sectors.  ICTs refer to a wide range of IT-enabled technologies to manage 
electronic information quickly and effectively, thus giving a competitive edge to the organizations to compete in the 
global markets. However, proper implementation of ICTs in corporate financial services is still challenging with 
different barriers. The paper attempts to develop a theoretical model by identifying the various Critical Success 
Factors (CSFs) and barriers through an exhaustive and state-of-the-art review of the existing literature to adopt ICTs 
in corporate financial services successfully. The developed theoretical model is empirically investigated using in-
depth interviews with employees working in corporate financial services. The regression results showed that social 
influence, effort expectancy, risk-taking, and top management support significantly influence the ICT adoption. 
Alternatively, lack of IT skills, lack of socio-economic conditions with ICT adoption, and the lack of environmental 
exposures are barriers to successful ICT adoption.

1. Introduction
 ICT encompasses all the digital technologies which facilitate the use of information (storage, retrieval, and 
transmission) by individuals, businesses, and organizations, enabling greater efficiency, effectiveness, and 
responsiveness to customers (BAU 2020). Multiple organizations operating in diverse sectors are readily adopting 
ICT services (Chowdhury 2006). ICT adoption in the corporate finance sector significantly contributes to cost 
reductions of financial intermediation services and the expansion of business activities (Dewan and Ramaprasad 
2014). According to World Bank Report (2019), ICT utilization has brought significant transformation to the 
Organization for Economic Corporation and Development (OECD) economies. The lack of a proper framework for 
successful ICT adoption in corporate finance is still a challenge that demands significant research attention 
(Kulkarni et al. 2019). The paper explores and investigates the different CSFs and barriers to successful ICT 
adoption by developing a theoretical framework. The results obtained may be helpful for managers, policymakers, 
business analysts, and IT specialists in dealing with the planning and implementation of ICTs incorporate.

6. Conclusion 
The goal of this research was to assist corporate IT practitioners in understanding how to use and manage 
information and communications technology to revitalise business processes, improve business decision-making, 
and achieve a competitive advantage through ICT adoption. The identifying of four important CSFs that influence 
ICT adoption in corporate finance services is the main finding of the above-mentioned study. Social Influence, 
Facilitating Conditions, Risk-Taking, and Top Management Support are the four components. And there are three 
major barriers to ICT adoption in corporate financial services. Lack of IT skills, Lack of Socio-Economic 
Conditions, and Lack of Environmental Exposure are the three variables. This implies that adequate information 
technology planning, as well as suitable staff and team management competence, are required. The findings of this 
research demonstrated that the maturity process produces more consistent and predictable outcomes. By 69.5 
percent of the variation in the Employee's Behavioural Intention to the adoption of ICTs in corporate financial 
services, the major statistical results supported the predictive validity of the conceptual model 1. Throughout the 
study, it was determined that Social Influence, Effort Expectancy, Risk-Taking, and Top Management Support all 
had a good impact on ICT adoption in corporate financial services, with the remainder of the factors having a little 
impact. In the variance of the Employee's Behavioural intention to affect the adoption of ICT in corporate financial 
services, model 2 outperformed model 1 by 61.7 percent. Throughout the research, it was discovered that a lack of 
IT skills, Lack of socioeconomic conditions, and Lack of environmental exposures all had favorable impacts on the 
adoption of ICT in corporate financial services, while the rest of the factors had little effect. 
 
Limitation 
Even though this study represents a fruitful attempt in the area of adoption of ICT in corporate financial services, it 
is restricted by limitations. Because this research data was gathered from a small sample of corporate sector 
employees from a few states, people respond differently backed on the different education levels. This study was 
conducted in the Indian context; however, if it was conducted in the global context, the results would be different. 
Because India is a developing country, respondents in India are more accurate than in other developing countries. 
The majority of the respondents in this survey were young, educated, and well versed with computers and the 
internet; the findings apply to other segments of the present population with varying characteristics. This research 
solely covers only one type of financial service i.e. the business sector.

Abstract 
Due to the pandemic in this time economic scenario increased, credit cards or debit cards use has become extremely 
commonplace due to online payments. Credit cards enable individuals to make large payments without having to carry 
huge amounts of money. The number of users is increasing, so credit card fraud also increased as well. The credentials 
on a credit card can be obtained fraudulently and used to defraud. So we're going to use Machine Learning Algorithms 
to collect data and overcome this issue. This project compares supervised algorithms like Logistic regression, Support 
vector machine, KNN, Decision Tree, Xgboost, etc., and finds the best model through hyper parameter tuning, Grid 
search and applies resampling techniques.

1. Introduction
An individual commits credit fraud when they use another's identity and creditworthiness to obtain credit or purchase 
goods and services without the intention of repaying the debt. 
Credit cards are scanned at the machine and are used with no permission from their owners. A duplicate card is created 
when a card is copied using a special swipe machine. Databases or email scams are sold, then they are used over the 
internet or the phone, a scam known as ""card, not present"" fraud. Obtain credit cards on someone else's behalf. The 
increase in fraud is directly due to the advancement of technology and everyday communication across all borders. 
Fraud has two sides one is prevention and the other is detection. so in this paper detection of fraud is going to learn. 
Prevention protects attackers as a defense. After prevention has failed, detection occurs. As a result, detection aids in 
the discovery and notification of fraudulent transactions as soon as they occur. Web payment gateways have recently 
become popular for card-not-present transactions in credit card operations. “The number of reports of identity theft 
climbed by 113% between 2019 and 2020, while the number of reports of identity theft using credit cards rose by 
44.6%. Of the almost 1.4 million instances of identity theft in 2020, 393,207 involved credit card fraud.As a result, 
credit card fraud surpassed government documents and benefits fraud as the second most frequent identity theft 
recorded crime for the year. 
According to the nilson report, Card-not-present fraud is on the rise and is to blame for 65% of all fraud-related losses. 
Credit cards were the most often stolen form of payment, accounting for almost 25% of fraud complaints including 
payment information. Card fraud losses in the US are anticipated to reach $12.5 billion by 2025. The data shows that 
3,432 cases of credit and debit card fraud were reported from all over India in 2021, an increase of almost 20% from 
the previous year. Such scams surged by more than 70% in 2020. It demonstrated an almost two-fold increase in credit 
and debit card-related fraud in only two years. However, there has been a significant surge in fraudulent transactions, 
which has had a significant impact on the economy. [globalnews]” 
Credit card fraud includes any type of fraud with a payment card, such as a credit or debit card. Fraud Detection 
applies to many industries like banking and financial sectors, insurances, government agencies, etc. There 2 types 
from which fraud can occur.  
1. physical card-based purchase in that the user of the card gave his card physically to someone for making
a payment of the product which he/she purchased. If he or she does not recognize that a card has been lost, it can result 
in a large financial loss for them as well as the credit card companies. 
2. online payment mode, as we know now- a day we all purchased things online and payment also done by
online payment mode. In this mode, attackers need only a little information for fraud or doing fraudulent transactions.

5. Future Enhancement & Conclusion  
In the future enhancement of this project, We will give a solution after the prediction of fraud transaction classifies 
what can we do further. We also go with real-time data or make real-time fraud detection systems as well. We can 
also use the deep learning method for better results. We can build an app as well as a website also who detects fraud 
transactions in real-time. 
 
From the literature, they used an imbalanced dataset to check the accuracy, precision and recall of different machine 
learning algorithms to predict the fraudulent transaction. But we will use sampling techniques to the balanced dataset. 
For an imbalanced dataset we can’t rely on the accuracy, we have to see precision, recall, F1-score, and roc-AUC 
curve, etc. From this evaluation, we can easily see which model works best on the imbalanced dataset as well as a 
balanced dataset.

Abstract 
During these hard times due to the widespread of COVID-19 all around the globe, everyone, including both teachers 
and students are forced to give and take education virtually, and most of them face issues of unavailability of mediums 
such as devices and space to store, manage and organize academic-related stuff, so to meet these insufficiencies our 
virtual coding platform provides a simple and efficient way to store, manage, organize and create all the practical 
related documents and files at a single place. Teachers can easily create classes and invite students, assign them tasks 
& coding assignments all in a single place, and evaluate each student based on the work that they have done. This 
platform eliminates the need of installing language-specific environments in their machines by providing an online 
IDE that supports many programming languages.

1. Introduction
Teaching online is at the forefront of every college professor’s mind nowadays. For those of us who teach computer 
science, and take programming classes, we're very much used to the energy and excitement of physical lab 
environments.  Obviously, during current pandemic times, it’s impossible for us to get together in these tightly 
packed physical spaces to hold lab classes. It is also difficult to maintain all student assignment works and notes 
related to lab class in one place. Students have to use many applications to do different tasks that create a mess. 
Finding a single specific platform that can help teachers and students to create, manage and complete assignments 
online with all required tools in one place is difficult. This covers all the problems that can be solved using this 
project. 
The Virtual Coding Platform for programming classes is a great advantage for teachers and students all around the 
globe to manage the programming assignment all on a single platform. A platform where teacher and student will be 
able to join the same classroom to perform programming practicals where students will have a functionality-rich 
online code compiler and editor to complete the coding assignment. It will help the student to keep all their work in 
a single place.  
Students and Teachers will get the innovative and interactive platform to create, manage, complete and evaluate 
programming assignments online. Students and Teachers will have a room where they will be able to store all lab 
related or assignment specific notes and material all at a single place. All this will be maintained in a real time 
environment. 
1.1 Objectives 
●
To virtualize the physical coding lab environments.
●
Archive and manage the work of students in one place.
●
To minimize the need for powerful hardware from the client-side.

Abstract 
The present study investigated the dimension mismatched between user’s anthropometry and kitchen design and the 
implication of designing a tool for work simplification in kitchen activities.  To find out the correlation between 
anthropometry measurements and kitchen design features 6 groups were created and the correlation among these 
was analyzed by using one-way ANOVA. Further, a handy step stool was developed by using Quality Function 
Deployment (QFD) methodology. Kitchen dimensions did not found to be matched with the majority of the 
women's physical responses. Women were found to be raising their heels, stretching their hands to perform the 
work, and adopting awkward postures which were simultaneously creating MSDs among women. For tool 
development, firstly customers determined the customer requirements and their relative weight along with technical 
requirements. The relationship matrix identified the technical requirements that satisfy most customer consequences. 
Maximum importance weight was received by T5, T1, and T6, and a low relative importance weight was found for T4 
(Fixed cost). Regarding comparison with competitors, the handy step stool was found to be more suitable in 
ergonomically designed (5), easy to convert as peruse (5), strength (5),  easy to sit and work(5), and easy to use as a 
step stool (5) parameters compared to other tools available in the market for same purposes. As per QFD, important 
criteria for handy step stool development were easy to use, followed by easily convertible and ergonomically fit.

This matrix depicts the values assigned by the researchers for the direction of improvement and/or standard values 
of each technical requirement needed to be competitive in the industry. Oftentimes, if a numerical value cannot be 
absolutely determined, the researchers and/or industry experts use judgment based on expertise in the subject area to 
assign ''targets."" The direction of improvement indicates the type of action needed to ensure that the technical 
requirements are sufficient to make the service competitive for each entity evaluated. As mentioned, to define school 
furniture dimensions or quantify the level of mismatch, it is important to consider students’ features. To avoid the 
mismatch problem, one of the best possible solutions is adjustability (Castellucc et al. 2014). 
6. Conclusion
Ergonomically designed tools play an important role in accomplishing effectiveness and efficiency while providing 
comfort and ease to industrial workers to accomplish the required productivity. The quality function deployment 
tool played an important role in a handy step stool development. A systematic methodology (illustrated in fig-1) was 
adopted in designing ergonomically designed tools. The requirements were quantified as requirements of customers’ 
technical requirements mentioned by the engineers. Workers' requirements were translated and accomplished in 
terms of ‘WHATs’ and ‘HOWs’ using QFD. The final concept was developed based on the target value of tool 
designing along with specific features. The changing taste of customers and mass customization demands greater 
research in the area of ergonomically designed tools for comfort and ease at work. Using QFD methodology, tool 
design incorporates the ideas, thoughts, and technical views of experts in product design, which are directly and 
indirectly related to the customers’ requirements for products. Research may be taken up to incorporate such 
changes in order to accomplish effectiveness and efficiency (Akbar et al. 2010)

Abstract 
Established in 1991, the European Journal of Information Systems (abbreviated as EJIS) is widely regarded as the 
preeminent international journal in the field of “information systems and management”. This article's objective is to 
provide a bibliometric overview of the research trends that have been observed in this journal between the years 1991 
and 2022 (till May). The publication data of all of the documents that were published in EJIS during this particular 
time period have been extracted from Scopus database and analyzed with the help of R Studio and VOSviewer. These 
documents primarily include articles, reviews, editorials, conference papers, and notes. In addition, citation analysis 
and keyword analysis have both been carried out in order to determine emerging patterns in the research. According 
to the study, EJIS is one of the most important journals with growing number of research publications year by year 
based on the analysis outcomes. This study is helpful to understand questions such as the scientific productivity, annual 
production, authors, institutions, and countries, etc.

1. Introduction
The European Journal of Information Systems (abbreviated as EJIS) in an international journal that covers all areas 
of Business and Information systems topics including technology, development, implementation, strategy, 
management, and policy. EJIS first appeared in 1991 founded by Ray J. Paul and the first editor – in – chief was Pär 
Ågerfalk, Uppsala University. It is widely regarded as the preeminent international journal in the field of “information 
systems and management”. Presently EJIS is listed in A* category as per the Australian Business deans council 
(Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC)., 2019). Since then, EJIS has altered as a result of social advancements, 
which significantly enhanced the journal's submission process. The number of researchers has increased significantly 
around the world along with developing countries majorly in European perspective on theory and practice of 
information systems. This leading IS journal is publishing 4 issues annually between 1991 and 2005. But with the 
increasing academic interests in IS research, currently EJIS is publishing, six issues per year since 2006. EJIS has a 
significant impact on business IS research and is currently one of the top academic publications in the field. Due to 
the increasing attention towards IS (Information systems) research, the IS community has become more international, 
and there have been substantial shifts in the practises governing the distribution of financial support to academia.  
However, with such trends and shifts what effects have had on the research that is presented in EJIS is still less 
obvious. The number of bibliometric analysis in this leading information systems journal is scant. An in-depth and 
exhaustive analysis is required in order to gain an understanding of the productivity of a journal. The diversity of the 
institutions and nations that have published articles in the journal, as well as the number of citations, the most 
productive authors, and the most cited publications, all contribute to the journal's overall productivity (Knight et al., 
2000). To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has not been performed any kind of in-depth bibliometric analysis 
on EJIS in order to evaluate its productivity up until this point in time. Many of the bibliometric studies analyse only

5. Conclusions 
The European Journal of Information systems is 30 years old. To celebrate this anniversary, this study presents the 
bibliometric overview of the leading trends of this journal over the past 30 years. This study analyses over wide range 
of issues through bibliometric indicators, including most cited documents, most cited authors, country wise analysis, 
organizations affiliations wise analysis and keywords analysis.  
 
The results indicate that USA is the most influential country, with several leading authors and affiliated institutions 
from this country published in this journal, followed by UK. From the general perspective, Georgia state university 
from USA is most productive institute in this journal, followed by Brunel university from UK. Most of the leading 
countries are economically developed countries in this journal. Certain developing countries also appear in the list, 
but with low number of publications includes India, China, and South Africa.

Based on the current trends, we anticipate an increase in the number of publications from European institutions. 
Recently, these nations have made significant strides in the journal, although they are still far away from British 
publishing standards. The assumption is, however, that they will continue to improve and, at some point in the future, 
attain levels comparable to those of the United Kingdom, particularly for the major European nations of France, 
Germany, Italy, and Spain. 
 
The journal is strongly connected to most of the Information systems research journals. To strengthen the analysis, 
results from VOSviewer and Biblioshiny are presented using graphical and visual representations. The analysis 
includes, co citations, bibliographic coupling, citation, co authorship, co-occurrences, word clouds, etc. The main 
advantage of this is to understand the trends of publications in the journal in a quantitative way very easily.  
 
It should be pointed out that the data is collected only from Scopus database. Therefore, the limitation of database 
might be involved in this study. When handling bibliographic material, Scopus and Web of Science, for example, 
employ full counting. That is, instead of a fractional unit based on the number of co-authors, these databases supply 
one publishing unit to each co-authoring participant. As a result, documents with numerous co-authors are more 
significant in the analysis than papers with a single author. The approach employs fractional counting in the map - 
based analysis with the VOSviewer to tackle this problem. Because the findings from full and fractional counting are 
so close, the conclusion is that there is no substantial difference between the two counting systems. 
Other limitations of the study should be considered. However, the overall goal of this study is to present an overview 
of the journal's major trends based on key bibliometric indices. As a result, journal readers get a broad perspective of 
the most important data from EJIS through 2022. However, keep in mind that these results are dynamic and subject 
to change when new mainstream themes emerge and particular factors increase or decrease their place in the journal.

Abstract 
This paper presents an overview on the change in the dynamics of the Performance Management process in the 
current business ecosystem which is majorly by technology in the post pandemic era. Be it work from home or 
Hybrid work options at the work place, every factor of Performance Management structure is critically analysed 
in this study and inter-dependencies of these factors in today’s virtual business ecosystem is highlighted too. A 
total of 7 critical elements of performance management were identified basis the critical literature review and 
through discussion and brainstorming sessions with managers and employee representatives and structured 
using pair-wise comparison. Structural and reachability matrices were formed and yielded a level of influence of 
each factor through Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach. MICMAC analysis was conducted to 
determine the dependency and driving power of these elements. The present study can be differentiated from the 
past studies on identified Performance Management as factors like Biasness of Manager and Relatable Past 
Performance which do play a critical role in evaluation but has not been extensively categorised in the 
framework earlier. This will help the managers, researchers and organizational specialists to encompass overall 
factors in assessing the performance of their teams without any biasness.

1. Introduction
 In the current unprecedented times of pandemic, it has become essential for the organisations to adapt and 
manoeuver through this critical phase by keeping their workforce aligned with the strategic objectives of the 
enterprise. Performance management as a corporate management tool helps managers in evaluating and 
monitoring employees' tasks. Performance management's objective is to create an environment where people 
can perform to their optimum best and perform the highest-quality work efficiently and effectively. It also helps 
managers and employees to discuss and set expectations, goals, and assess how individuals' work aligns with 
the company's overall vision (Tardi 2021).  
Organisations across industries are now moving towards a digital business environment, expanding their reach 
across different geographies and serving client needs that require digital innovation and transformation. Hence 
in these times, a performance management contour that fits in strategically and culturally for an organisation is 
indispensable. Though the workplace has now grown more analytical and enterprise technologies and tools have 
drastically improved but Performance Management (PM) as a process has not changed in that manner and has

Figure 2. Driver – Dependency Diagram 
4. Results 
Using the ISM approach, this paper has attempted to model the criticality of performance factors and to be able 
to present their driving and dependence power in the performance management process. Biasness in evaluation 
by the manager has a critical driving power but is an independent factor that can not be influenced but can 
influence the objectively delivered feedback as seen in the ISM model. Incentives, yardsticks, grading, and 
Virtues of an employee in the performance management process are the most dependent factors followed by 
her/his relatable past performance. 
 
However, the effectiveness of the performance management process which is dynamic can only be maintained if 
the factors like regularity of feedback are maintained, biases in evaluation to be minimized by consistent 
training and awareness of the managers. Maintaining the skill enhancement process and educating the teams 
about the goals and yardsticks of the organisation will also enforce the right impetus in delivering effective 
performance management. This exercise has highlighted the interrelationships between the various factors and 
certainly calls out for actions to be taken for making the overall performance management process efficient and 
value-driven. 
 
5. Conclusion and Discussions 
Through this paper, researchers wanted to emphasise that the above-mentioned seven parts of performance 
management are dynamic and simple to execute, either via the use of a PMS tool or manually. Performance 
Management programmes with the above characteristics and tool functionality can be implemented by 
organisations with capital expenditure feasibility. A user-friendly interface and appropriate training to gauge the 
functionality of the tool can bring in more accessibility and adaption. However, in mid-sized or small 
organisations where it is tough for PMS application implementation of top-line/bottom-line pressures if the 
framework‘s elements are put to use and implemented effectively even manually but with proper records, it can 
generate a lot of value and bring in productive changes for both employees and organisation. This ISM model 
was developed based on inputs from academicians and practicing managers. The iterative process of the 
proposed ISM model helps the managers to identify the interrelationship between the Performance 
Managements’ factors and frame strategies for effective implementation. This has enormous feasibility of 
strategic decision for policy formulation of the organisation. In addition to that, the proposed ISM model acts as 
an ideal guide for a future investment decision. The results are more generic and can be duplicated to other 
specific industries also shortly have to be considered as future scope of the study. Also, the factors of the 
performance management used in this study identified through the inputs from the literature and expert opinions 
can get impacted in the times to come basis the external environment changes like government policy alterations 
and even working environment changes pertaining to the pandemic situation.

Abstract 
Drones can go places that humans can't access, so they are an ideal solution for dangerous search and rescue efforts 
and deliver emergency supplies to remote locations and disaster areas. Drones are playing a significant role in 
following activities undertaken by the Military, Healthcare, Disaster & Rescue management, Fire Fighters, 
Warehouses, Municipal Authorities, etc. The current project aims to design and fabricate a contra-rotating 
propeller drone that can be used for carrying payloads.

1. Introduction
Drones are becoming increasingly popular and popular. Drones can go places that humans cannot because they are 
accessible from anywhere. Fixed-wing drones and rotary winged drones are two types of drones that are currently 
in use. Fixed-winged drones are nothing more than drones that lack rotors. They have two fixed wings and are 
controlled by the drone's tail. Rotary-winged drones contain rotors for lifting and forward movement the drone, so 
these are the types of rotary-winged drones. 1.Quadcopters/Hex copters/octocopters, 2. Remotely piloted 
helicopters. We aim to design a remotely piloted rotary-wing aerial vehicle with a contra-rotating propeller. This 
paper tells how to design and fabricate the contra-rotating propeller drone using fusion 360, and 3d printing, and 
FDM machining.  
1.1 Problem Statement 
Nowadays usage of drones is increasing rapidly, Drones are used in military applications and medical and 
emergency purposes that the problem is drones are available at a high cost in the market, So to reduce the problem, 
quadcopters are available at a high cost, So to reduce the cost, new design of the drone is needed, so the drone is 
contra-rotating propeller drone, Contra-rotating propeller drone contains only two motors, so weight and power 
will be reduced, This drone carries the same weight as quadcopter carries, then cost of the drone is reduced.   
2. Literature Review
Flight dynamics is an important part in controlling a drone. Tanmay Kumar et al. and M. Khan et al. worked on

Abstract 
The age range of 15 to 59 accounts for more than 60% of Indians, a group dubbed as the ""Demographic Dividend"" in 
that country. India is now going through a demographic change. Before India to take advantage of this dividend, the 
labour market needs to be capable of producing enough jobs to effectively absorb this economically engaged 
population. The Indian government has put in place a number of initiatives to create jobs, such as ""Skill India,"" which 
seeks to train over 40 crore people by 2022, whether through self-employment or paid work. The Indian government 
has introduced ""Start-up India,"" a programme intended to aid start-ups, in order to inspire young people to build their 
own enterprises and jobs. Young people offer a rich supply of potential employees for firms since they are frequently 
the driving force behind innovative concepts and technologies. In order to support the growth and development of 
Tribal Youth in the TSP region of Southern Rajasthan, the Indian government has created several flagship 
programmes, including Start-up India and Make in India, Digital India, Skill India, and others. This study evaluates 
these programmes.

1. Introduction
Even if a nation has abundant natural resources and financial capital, the use of those resources will be less than 
optimal if entrepreneurship is absent. In today's industrial world, the entrepreneur is a valuable asset because of his or 
her unique skills and experience. Entrepreneurs are held accountable for more than just their own financial well-being. 
They must also create jobs for others and boost the country's GDP as a whole. Entrepreneurship has a long history in 
India. According to a report by the Indian Industrial Commission (1916-1918), during a time when the West of Europe, 
the cradle of the modern industrial system, was populated by uncivilised barbarians, India was known for the wealth 
of her rulers and the tremendous artistic talent of her craftsmen. Even when the first merchant expeditions from the 
West arrived in India at a far later date, the country's economic development was at least similar to that of the more 
advanced European nations. To be an entrepreneur, one must be an ambitious personality with an eye for possibilities 
and a vision and possess business acumen and a strong sense of determination. Three groups of entrepreneurs have 
been identified.

(IPRs)”. A new programme called “start-up Intellectual Property Protection (SIPP)” has been launched to make it 
easier to file patents, protect IPRs, and commercialise them. 
 
Exemption from Prior Experience or Turnover Criteria: Previously only micro and small firms were eligible for this 
incentive, which is now open to all new enterprises, regardless of their size. According to a regulation released by the 
Ministry of Finance, ""micro, tiny or otherwise"" start-ups are now excluded from several tendering eligibility 
requirements. 
Easy Exit: When it comes to innovation in start-ups, there is a high risk of failure. Many businesses have failed in the 
past. This programme encouraged new tribal youth entrepreneurs to try out new and innovative thoughts and ideas 
without losing and stuck in a complicated and lengthy closing process where their money would be stuck indefinitely. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Opportunities cannot be guaranteed by the former role of government, which was to control all economic resources. 
Instead, it ought to act as a facilitator to guarantee the most efficient use of resources. The role of the government 
should be to help the populace make better decisions by offering a targeted policy environment and knowledge. Start-
up India and the other major initiatives stated earlier have been adopted by the government in an effort to create an 
environment of ""maximum governance and least government."" These initiatives have helped to create a start-up-
friendly environment in the TSP region of Southern Rajasthan. 
 
The fundamental objective of start-ups is to change people's mentality in order to turn India from a nation of job 
seekers into a nation of job producers. Without a doubt, start-ups have proven to be a useful tool for encouraging 
people to establish their own businesses, but a lot of people have been abandoning their jobs to take advantage of the 
start-up programme in the hopes of earning more money as a self-employed person. Many start-ups have failed 
because they were unable to compete in the cutthroat market, but some have been successful and are expanding 
gradually. According to India's labour ministry, this is terrible news for the nation's expanding economy. Even while 
this initiative hasn't yet had any noteworthy positive effects, in the long run, it could be more effective at giving young 
people in Southern Rajasthan's TSP region work. Prospective business owners should thus pay close attention to the 
objectives and rules of the launch plan. By establishing start-up incubators in remote areas, it is more likely that new 
firms will succeed there and that the problem of seasonal employment and unemployment will be resolved.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 crisis has pulled back the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for 
Sustainable Development in emerging and advanced economies. A systematic literature review was conducted to 
explore the status, hindrances and opportunities available to boost the green financing in SAARC countries. The 
study found that Bhutan and Maldives stands at top in average energy efficiency score, while Afghanistan and Nepal 
at lowest. Emerging economies including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka has already introduced 
and facilitated green bonds to the investors. However, lack of funds, transparency and accountability are some of the 
major hindrances in the development of green economy in SAARC countries. Low sovereign credit rating and poor 
rating of the bonds issuer are the serious issues which pulls back investors to invest in green bonds. Along with 
better parity between risk-return and maturity, factors including financial development (backed with green 
technologies), technological advancement, carbon pricing and green bonds, can act as a base to boost green 
financing in SAARC countries. Governments, financial institutions and even non-banking financial institutions are 
working in coordination to develop green infrastructure and emerge as a green leader. This systematic literature 
review will be helpful for academicians, professionals and to the policy makers, in better understanding of the green 
market in SAARC countries. The policy makers can take the findings, hindrances and suggestions as a base for the 
development of environment friendly policies.

Introduction
Selection of the material is vital role in modern manufacturing industries, machining means raw material is 
converted into final finished products two types of machining was done on any material namely conventional and 
unconventional machining, in conventional machining process during the operation single point or multipoint 
cutting tool is directly contact with the work piece then remove the unwanted material in the form of chip on the 
work piece (Kumar et al. 2014). the contact between the tool and work piece result is friction induced between them 
and many frictional forced are presented conventional machines are used to machining the ductile material only to 
overcome the above non conventional machines are used to remove the unwanted material on the work piece in this 
case to remove the unwanted material there is no direct contact between the work piece and tool in case of un 
conventional machining no tool is used to remove excess material  on the work piece so tool wear rate and frictional 
forces are negligible(Jain N et al. 2007).  Non conventional machines are used to machining on thin brittle material, 
In recent trends industries are used non conventional machines to remove excel material on the work piece, in this 
research work Micro abrasive air jet drilling machine is used to make the holes on the work piece in which 30 
micron size of the Silicon Carbide (SiC) is used as a abrasive particle with smooth surface (Sridhar. A et al. 2019), 
the abrasive particles coming out from the exit of the nozzle with high velocity (Ghobeit. A et al. 2009). These high 
velocity particles are impinged on the targeted surface of the work, the abrasive particles mixed with air in mixing 
chamber at the out let of the nozzle pressure energy is converted into kinetic velocity (Bhalekar.P et al. 2018) due to 
erosion principle these high pressure abrasive particle erode the material on the work piece, abrasive jet machining 
operation is good for machining grooves and slots with good surface finish the components of the abrasive air jet 
drilling machine as shown in Figures 1-5 respectively. 
Taguchi method involves reducing the variation in a process through robust design of experiment ( c. Hiremath et al. 
2012). The overall objective of the method is to produce high quality product at least cost (Li. H.Z et al. 2009) 
therefore, poor quality in a process affects not only the manufacturer but also society. This is a method for designing

Real - Time Analytics Dashboard for Machine Maintenance

Abstract 
Productivity losses in the manufacturing industry have to be minimized to perform at total capacity consistently. If 
productivity losses are neglected, a reduction in overall revenue results from an underperforming manufacturing plant. 
Deep Learning (DL) and Computer Vision (CV) can serve as an automated surveillance system for continuous 
monitoring. The combination of DL and CV, which act as eyes and brain, can capture the activities in the 
manufacturing plant and convert such visual data into meaningful information in the form of object detections. The 
requirement is to detect the status of maintenance, operator and machines and their interactions based on user-defined 
thresholds. Metrics such as machine utilization, Mean-Time to Repair, Mean-Time to Failure, Operator in position 
and maintenance behavior are derived from these detections. This paper compares two approaches using data for a 
real-time analytics dashboard to track productivity losses in a manufacturing setup. The results are compared to select 
a better performing approach regarding their contribution to productivity analytics accuracy. The first approach uses 
weights of the Yolov4 model to detect maintenance and operator as a person in combination with HSV colour filtering 
for machine status and maintenance operator classification. Later uses Transfer learning on Yolov4 to detect machine 
status, maintenance and operator. Literature shows that transfer learning is significantly faster and consumes less data 
than conventional model training, so an approach to compare conventionally trained models was unnecessary. The 
results from the experiment show that the second approach using transfer learning was accurate compared to the first 
approach.

1. Introduction
Monitoring productivity losses and minimising them is critical for the efficient functioning of a manufacturing plant 
and is more vital in cases where there is a shortage of products, like in the semiconductor industry. Not monitoring 
productivity losses to minimise them will result in substandard product quality and reduced plant throughput.  Hence 
proper monitoring of machines and working individuals is required for the appropriate functioning of a manufacturing 
plant. 
Industry 4.0 acts as a catalyst in accelerated growth through systematic adaptation of new generation cutting edge 
tools like Artificial intelligence, Big Data Analytics and cloud computing (R. Dubey et al. 2020). Machines in the 
latest manufacturing plants practising industry 4.0 come equipped with data collection and data transmission 
capabilities. The problem is with legacy machines that do not have the data collection, processing and evaluation. 
These legacy machines also fail to communicate with other machines. However, these legacy machines are in perfect 
working conditions and can deliver high-quality products as per the defined standards. So, external components are 
required to enable the machine to be part of the industry 4.0 initiative. These external components help in capturing 
data needed for productivity monitoring in the manufacturing plant. Literature supports the possibility of this 
conversion (V. Nguyen et al. 2018). Our goal is to track the maintenance person, operator person, and machine 
operation for this study. So, a camera for a single line covering ample details is necessary for the data capturing. This 
data is then processed and fed to a Deep Neural Network to obtain a semantic interpretation of data to display the 
productivity analytics in a dashboard.

3.1.2 Operator Analytics 
Figure 25 gives us information about how much time an operator is spending at 
the machine based on how far he is from the machine. A threshold value is fixed 
by trial and error. As long as the operator is within this threshold distance, it is 
considered to be in the working area. From this dashboard, we can analyse the 
efficiency of the operator during shift hours. 
4. Summary and Conclusions
4.1 Summary
From the results, it is clear that there are low precision and recall values for
individual classes in the HSV method when compared to the Transfer Learning
method. This indicates that the Transfer learning approach would be accurate for
detection than the HSV colour filtering method. The weights of the Transfer
learning method were used to obtain the dashboard results. The transfer learning
method consumes fewer data compared to traditional deep learning methods. But
HSV colour filtering required even fewer data. It is important to note that the
results of the HSV method are not inaccurate because of using lesser data
compared to the Transfer learning method. It is worthy to note that transfer
learning approach results can be improved by improving the quality of data we
supply. The reason for the poor performance of the HSV method lies in the colour
filtering method itself. When we filter unnecessary colours from the region of
interest, certain elements creep into the region of interest as the subject moves.
When they are in the same colour as that of the person of interest, these elements
affect the result, causing the model to perform poorly. For example, in Figure 26,
the bounding box indicating the person marked in white when in front of the
machine has the machine's blue colour making its way into the bounding box,
which will cause the person in the white-coloured box also to be classified as an
orange class due to domination by blue colour over the brown colour within ROI.
4.2 Conclusions 
We compared two methods and concluded that the transfer learning approach is better to generate data for dashboards 
to monitor productivity losses in a manufacturing setup. The Transfer learning method is faster to train and lighter in 
computation with the perks of consuming less data than traditional Deep Learning methods. Transfer learning 
performs better consistently throughout the testing for each class, as shown in the results. From the dashboards 
generated, strict monitoring can be done on the processes in the manufacturing, and processes contributing to a loss 
in productivity can be rectified by conducting a root cause analysis.

Abstract 
This study will examine the impact of economic, environmental, social, and technical factors in reverse logistics, 
as well as present a summary of significant drivers and barriers that have the potential to stimulate or deter 
enterprises from implementing reverse logistics methods. In the last half century, MSME sector has grown as a 
tremendously lively and competitive segment of the Indian economy. However, most research does not focus on 
this sector. To bridge this gap, this study identifies and evaluates the critical factors of Reverse logistics in the 
Indian MSME’s. From a systematic literature review a list of critical factors in Reverse logistics were identified 
and a questionnaire was developed to conduct a survey in 36 Indian MSME’s to assess their efficiency in Reverse 
logistics. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology was applied to the data collected to identify the 
important Reverse logistics enablers and barriers. This methodology can also be used to assess the efficiency of 
the reverse logistics model, as well as to increase efficiency by altering critical factors. Key performance Areas 
such as Performance management system, Latest technologies, Volume of products, financial investment are the 
key performance inputs to be given more importance for the inefficient companies to become efficient. Awareness 
of Reverse logistics, Complexity of operation and third-party logistics are the output variables to be concentrated 
for the inefficient companies to match the benchmark companies. It can be further extended to other states and 
countries so as to make cumulative study among the region. 
Keywords 
Reverse logistics, Data Envelopment Analysis, Green supply chain, Sustainability and MSMEs. 
1. Introduction
Due to increasing global competition, climate change, and government regulations, sustainability has become a 
top priority in most manufacturing companies worldwide (Vivek Gopi and Saleeshya PG 2022). The concept of 
incorporating environmentally friendly practises into the traditional supply chain is known as sustainable or green 
supply chain. The different aspects of Green Supply Chain Management(GSCM) are green purchasing, green 
manufacturing, green transportation, green distribution, green marketing and reverse logistics (Hervani et al. 
2005). One of the major challenges faced in GSCM is the profitability in reverse logistics which involves End-of-
life product collection, inspection and categorization, recovery procedure, lack of control over the volume, quality, 
and timing of returns are some concerns that needed to be addressed. The objective of this paper is to explore the 
current status of reverse logistics practises among different sectors through a survey-based study and to identify 
the critical factors (enablers and barriers) involved in implementing reverse logistics and finally doing the 
performance evaluation using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and benchmark the best practises of reverse 
logistics. This paper examines the role of economics, regulation, and corporate citizenship in reverse logistics and 
provides an outline of significant enablers and barriers that have the potential to incentivize or discourage firms 
from using reverse logistics practises.  
2. Literature Review
GSCM refers to the integration of environmental thinking into supply chain management from raw material 
extraction to product design, manufacturing processes, delivery of final products to consumers, and end-of-life 
management (Srivastava 2007). The three pillars of sustainability of any system are Environmental, Economic 
and Social aspects which are called Triple Bottom Line (TBL). The two enablers Technology and Ethics are the 
foundation of sustainability (Molamohamadi and Ismail 2013) (Vinay Venugopal and Saleeshya PG 2019). In the 
academic community, GSCM has proven itself as a significant field and a distinct subject of sustainability. Since 
the last twenty years, GSCM research has exploded, but more understanding is still needed for future study. There 
are a number of prior research papers on GSCM (Soda et al. 2016). Some papers focus on the methodology of 
GSCM while the others concentrate on specific aspects and practices like green design, green manufacturing,

focussing on improving their waste management practises like proper disposal of scrap material and reusing the 
used products and slowly develop their reverse supply chain to become more efficient and productive among their 
competitors. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future work 
Among 36 companies surveyed and studied, 25 of them were found to be efficient and the rest 11 was inefficient. 
14 of the companies were pump manufacturers and 6 of them can improve their reverse logistics practises to match 
the benchmark companies. Other sectors like foundries, battery manufacturing and spare parts manufacturing 
practise reverse logistics in an optimised way and function as benchmark DMU’s. Key performance Areas such 
as Performance management system, Latest technologies, Volume of products, Financial investment are the key 
performance inputs to be given more importance for the inefficient companies to become efficient. Awareness of 
Reverse logistics, Complexity of operation and third party logistics are the output variables to be concentrated for 
the inefficient companies to match the benchmark companies. Sectors like valve manufacturing, and industrial 
equipment manufacturers can concentrate on the above mentioned factors and gain a competitive edge in the 
market.  
 
This study was conducted and limited to around 36 Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in Tamil 
Nadu. It can be further extended to other states and countries so as to make cumulative study among the region. 
It should be emphasised that this research had a restricted amount of time for data collection, hence the survey 
had a minimal number of respondents. Because this is a preliminary study, it aims to learn more about MSMEs' 
reverse logistics methods. In recent times we find that there is a rapid growth in electric mode of transportation, 
so focus on battery manufacturing and electric vehicles segment would be good extension to this study. With the 
limited time available we limited our study to only 36 companies, increasing the number of companies would 
more precise and yield better results.

Abstract 
This research paper aims to understand lean-sustainability enablers, criteria, and attributes in the pottery industry and 
develop an assessment framework for lean sustainability. For this framework, a multi-grade fuzzy approach and 
importance-performance analysis are used. The case study has been conducted at the case pottery unit located in India. 
The lean-sustainability index value for the case pottery unit is 8.01, which belongs to the ‘very highly lean-sustainable 
practices’ level. The identified weaker attributes for the case-pottery unit are supplier readiness and maintenance. 
Suggestions are provided to improve the weaker attributes. The developed framework helps pottery unit managers to 
improve their lean-sustainability practices.

1. Introduction
India is a country with a rich culture of several traditional products, with pottery being one of the most prominent and 
quality items being exported to almost 140 countries. In the year 2019-20, the pottery industry in India exported around 
9.97 million USD of products to other nations (Rai., 2020). However, the industry, when overlooked, experiences 
several problems which can be resolved to enhance productivity and revenue and improve the worker’s state of affairs. 
Mahatma Gandhi once said, “If small-scale industries are established, then people would not face problems with 
production or external markets.” (Kaur and Singh, 2015). Small-scale industries are an important sector that rolls out 
numerous products that benefit both the customer and the manufacturer. These products range from daily grocery 
items to well-crafted handicraft items. Pottery is one such example where we can club it into the daily needs of the 
people as well as showcase it as a handicraft item. Also, pottery units face difficulties in selling their cooking utensils 
in the market in India (Suresh, 2015). Pottery units are available all over the nation, but these industries are under 
great stress today due to the rising competitive products from big industries and also the fast-moving lifestyle of our 
citizens. These units are now vulnerable to the extent of shutting down their operations if not well promoted or 
supported. 
The pottery units are mainly run by traditional families or groups who are skilled in the pottery manufacturing industry. 
They have inherited the culture and the skills to carry on the businesses that benefit both the environment and society 
as well as themselves. However, the emergence of new generations of industries adopting modern business practices 
has rolled out reliable and lasting products at a competitive price. This dynamic shift has caused the pottery units to 
lose their businesses, and they are on the verge of shutting down due to low sales volume. This would mean the death 
of a traditional business culture that is inherent to India and also the loss of an environment-friendly product that is 
viable for the polluted mother earth. The study was conducted on how to keep the business sustainable in the changing 
environment and how to keep a competitive nature for these traditional businesses with the new world’s business 
practices. Or in simple words, it is integrating traditional business technology with modern world developed business 
practices to bring up the manufacturing units. 
The research was done using a multi-grade fuzzy approach, which is explained in Section 3 of this research paper. 
The enablers, criteria, and attributes are defined and analyzed using this approach to answer the research questions 
developed, which are given in the upcoming paragraph. 
The study focuses on answering the below questions: 
RQ1: How the lean-sustainability practice level can be measured in a pottery manufacturing unit?

Figure 1 shows the graphical representation of IPA. 7% of the factors in quadrant I need concentration and the 
management should take appropriate actions to improve it. 
 
6. Practical Implication 
The study understands and explains the various factors involved in the pottery manufacturing units and where the 
business concentration points have to happen to ensure the smooth flow of the daily operations. With the practical 
difficulties and bottlenecks experienced by the workers and management of the pottery unit, the study well identifies 
the lean and sustainability enablers in the manufacturing unit. The research identified two enablers, nine criteria, and 
twenty-seven attributes and rated the priority using the multi-grade fuzzy approach as explained. With the results now, 
the researchers and management can concentrate on the important requirements such as supplier readiness and 
maintenance and strive to improve these factors in the business model. 
To improve the supplier readiness, the management can take key decisions and this will ensure the steady flow of raw 
materials into the unit even during a crisis time. Proper maintenance ensures the operational unit is running without a 
halt in the entire network. 
Adoption and implementation of lean and sustainable practices in small-scale industries can help to improve revenue, 
reduce unanticipated outcomes and improve the lifestyle of the workers in the organization. 
 
7. Conclusion  
The present study focused on analyzing the current situations of the pottery manufacturing units and identifying the 
possibility of lean and sustainable implementation in the organization. Without lean and sustainable practices, the 
organization is identified to have many losses and is not capable of meeting the market fluctuations or demands. Small-
scale industry units have generally not implemented lean and sustainability practices in their respective organizations 
and these organizations are stuck when unexpected events occur. However, these organizations provide a source of 
income for many daily wage workers and should not be put on hold because they may have an impact on the livelihood 
of many workers. Halting these types of industries can also mean losing many traditional products in which the 
employees are skilled. 
In today’s business world, lean-sustainability practices are of utmost importance to cope with the rising demands and 
increasing competition. While lean focuses on eliminating waste and improving efficiency, agile focuses on 
eliminating waste going to landfills to reduce environmental pollution. A manufacturing unit will have several sub-

tangible and intangible waste over time. If lean is implemented, it can save by eliminating these wastes, especially the 
most precious ones such as time, materials, and energy. This can save on further costs incurred to the organization and 
ensure better revenue in the long run. Any manufacturing unit will produce some sort of waste that goes to landfills, 
and it is important in today’s world that these landfills are reduced by the units to save the mother earth as well as to 
be on a competitive track with other industries. From the identified and prioritized criteria and enablers, it is clear that 
the industry can be better run with minimal changes and can improve the situations of the daily wage workers, increase 
revenue, reduce waste, and meet the fluctuating needs of the market with minimal inventory.

Abstract 
The idea of using generic pharmaceuticals is generally acknowledged around the world. Nonetheless, it has 
struggled to acquire traction in India due to a lack of awareness, information and faith in the product's quality. 
Therefore, keeping in line with this idea a study was conducted to assess consumer knowledge and attitudes 
concerning generic drug usage and distribution, as well as to raise awareness among survey participants. A cross-
sectional questionnaire survey was done with 208 consumers, 65 retailers and 15 PMBJAK. In our study, 78% of 
consumers were aware of generic medicines, 13% believed that generic medicines had higher quality, 76% knew 
about PMBJAK, 93% of retailers believed that branded medicines were of higher quality, 83% of them were aware 
of PMBJAK and 34% believed that branded medicines were prescribed the most in their area through the 
prescription process. Our findings imply that participants' knowledge and attitudes about generic drugs were lacking. 
Doctors' recommendations and drug company advantages have been demonstrated to influence retailers. The 
findings highlight the need of raising public awareness and understanding of generic drugs, PMBJAK, and sensible 
drug usage.

1. Introduction
A generic medicine has the same chemical constituent as a previously patent-protected treatment. After the patents 
on the original pharmaceuticals expire, generic drugs can be sold. The medical profile of generics is thought to be 
equal in performance since the active chemical ingredient is the same. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in 
a generic medicine is the same as in a brand-name drug, but it may differ in terms of manufacturing process, 
formulation, excipients, colour, flavour, and packaging (Nogués, J.J., 1990). Even though they are not linked with a 
specific manufacturer, generic drugs are usually subject to government restrictions in the countries where they are 
marketed. They have the manufacturer's name and a generic nonproprietary name for the drug, such as the United 
States Adopted Name (USAN) or the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) (INN). A generic medicine's active 
ingredients must be the same as those in the original brand-name formulation. In most cases, generic copies of drugs 
become available after the patent protections provided to the drug's original originator expire (Rachit, K et al., 
2011). When generic medications are released to the market, both the original brand-name product and its generic 
competitors typically see large price reductions. In most countries, patents grant protection for 20 years. Many 
countries and regions, including the European Union and the United States, may provide producers up to five years 
of extended protection (""patent term restoration"") if they meet specific conditions, such as completing paediatric 
clinical studies. 
""Branded generics"" are goods that are either unique dosage forms of off-patent medications manufactured by a 
manufacturer who is not the molecule's originator, or a molecular copy of an off-patent product with a commercial 
name, according to the FDA and the National Health Service. Because a business that makes branded generics can

sign; however, many retailers were not as ready for substitution as the consumers. Promotion of generic drugs has an 
influence on people's financial burden. We attempted to raise knowledge about the use of generic drugs by 
delivering information pamphlets to the study participants in the hopes of changing their views toward generic 
medications.  
5. Conclusion
Despite policymakers' encouragement, generic medicine usage in India has struggled to garner general acceptance. 
The use of generic drugs has mostly been limited to government facilities in our nation. The fact that generic drugs 
can save money is well-known and acknowledged. It is generally recognized that ideas about medications, as well as 
beliefs about the condition, impact prescription decisions, and studies have found unfavorable connections between 
low adherence and particular worries about medicine. The lack of information, expertise, and education about 
pharmaceuticals in terms of consumption, prescription, and dispensing is the major reason why most participants 
choose branded medicines over generic medicines. The core factors forming consumer’s opinion and expectations 
for generic medicines are medical professional’s recommendations and previous experience. The main advantage of 
generic medicines according to the participants in the study are the lower price. Retailers are found to be influenced 
by doctor’s recommendation and benefits of drug companies. The results raise the issue of the awareness and 
knowledge about generic medicines, Pradhana Manthri Bharthiya PMBJAK and the rational drug use in the general 
population.

Abstract 
National Stock Exchange (NSE) is on the list of the TOP 10 stock exchange markets in the world. NSE builds 
trust among customers to invest in the companies which are listed with them. In India, NSE has a list of companies 
that are from distinct sectors like Financial, Health, Information Technology, Retail consumers, Real estate, Fast-
moving consumer goods, etc. NSE has categorized the companies into Nifty 50, Nifty 100, Nifty 200, and Nifty 
500. In this article, we developed a machine-learning algorithm for Nifty 500 companies that helps to create a
better portfolio within the top 500 companies for the customers or clients by using various Python libraries and
tools, packages which finally results to find out the rank. Lastly, this rank helps the user to figure out whether to
invest in that particular company or not even though they were belongs to the top 500 in the nation.

1. Introduction
National Stock Exchange of India Limited is located in Maharastra, and it is the leading stock institute in India which is 
successfully lasting for decades with its performance, determination, and hard work to create better stocks for the users. 
In the year 2021, it was the world's largest derivatives exchange by the number of contracts traded based on the FIA 
statistics. In 1992 the NSE establishes as the first dematerialized electronic exchange in the nation. NSE is only the private 
body that provided the modern and fully automatic screen-based stock exchangesystem for the users to invest and perform 
other stock operations. So as surpassing the years people came across the stocks knowing from their friends, colleagues, 
relatives, or self-learning which resulted in to increase in the number of users who were investing in stocks. 
These days numerous youthful age individuals were attempting to put resources into stocks as everybody's saying is to 
make some cash which assists them with using for different purposes in their everyday life or to meet their desires. So 
when we are putting away our well-deserved cash we expect consequently sum as benefits. To creates such benefits in 
stocks one should have to follow essential standards like breaking down, noticing, investigating, and too fundamental 
monetary proportions and their correlations. Many individuals lost their cash because of an absence of certainty because 
the amateurs don't have a clue about the essentials of how to contribute, how much need to contribute, how to choose a 
stock, or probably what are the contemplations to decide on a stock. People should be equipped for anticipating 
considering the ongoing information or investigation. 
Financial Times appraises that as of April 2018, 6 crores (60million) retail investors had invested their savings in stocks 
in India, either through direct purchases of equities or through mutual funds. 
To eradicate this problem, in this article we developed an algorithm that helps everyone to identify a good company to 
invest with based on the rank obtained by us using more than 100 financial filters like financial ratios, enterprise ratios, 
growth rate, etc with in the 500 as for this project our team chooses Nifty 500. Which is developed by using various

As shown in the above figure 3 there are no missing values in the data, the plot helps us to analyze the respective filter 
following whether any null values exist or not (Figure 7). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7.  Sector-wise rank 
 
 
The above diagram (Figure 7) displays ranks of various sectors present within the dataset. Each sector consists 
summarized/average rank of all companies belonging to particular sector. After done with the weighted sum as stated 
in the methodology then finally rank is obtained with help of all the above techniques and step by step analyses. The 
chart above depicts the rankings of several sectors within the Nifty 500. Because this graph is simple enough for a 
layperson to grasp, a retail investor may simply assess the data. The present statistic depicts which sectors an investor 
may truly invest their savings or hard-earned money in order to grow their wealth. The image above depicts the firm 
rank derived after employing several methodologies. This business ranking assists investors, particularly those who 
are new to investing and want to invest in stocks with a large quantity of money. As one can simply grasp the line 
graph that shows-axis-rank, x-axis-company name, one can quickly decide in which firm they want to invest based on 
their financial history. 
 
5.2 Future Scope 
As our mission and aim are to encourage more young people to participate in stocks, we are always striving to 
improve the data display and existing algorithm. As our future scope is to forecast organizations utilizing 
different financial-related parameters (Jiao et al., 2017) As a result, it aids consumers in planning their 
portfolios (Satyaprasad 2018) ahead of time. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Individual or retail investors, because many investors nowadays are young. If someone wants to invest in 
stocks, they need to understand the fundamentals of stock analysis. (Padhan,2007). However, being a youth 
conveys that the population is just focused on achieving their want, which is to get money, but they will not 
focus on the research portion and making themselves by educating or learning the information. So, based on 
the RANK we collected, our results assist them in finalizing the sector and specific they are interested in. The

goal is to encourage young people to invest in equities and not to let them go broke. In terms of our goal, we 
will always strive to improve the approaches that make the user interface more user pleasant and continue to 
work on data visualization to make it easier in response to feedback in the upcoming phase of the execution.

Abstract 
Technology has given pace to e-retail sector with development of machine learning, artificial intelligence, brain 
mapping and so on.  In other words technological advancements have made it convenient for the consumers to 
experience the global market from the confines of its room. It has optimized the system, reduced the operating time 
and enhanced the consumer experience by integrating additional modules to its operations. The objectives of the 
research are to know recent technological advancements in e retail, to understand technology and e retail 
relationship, to learn about Multi Level Integration. This paper is an attempt to understand the need for multilevel 
integration with the help of technological advancement and underpin the integration of technology at various levels 
which seems to change the scenario of e-retailing in coming days. Research Methodology secondary information has 
been collected from various sources such as journals, books and statistical bulletin to support the data. Technical 
advancements have brought benefits to the retail sector by giving them scope to improvise. These improvisations 
have brought them new customers which are more demanding, enthusiastic and aware of the products that they 
require. Despite the fact that technological advancements have benefitted the retail sector and the consumers, there 
are certain limitations such as cost of infrastructure, cost of technology etc. that needs to be addressed.

Abstract 
Conventional control schemes employed for controlling the wheeled humanoid robot consume more computational 
time due to large number of calculations. A kinematic control scheme with better computational efficiency adopted for 
controlling wheeled humanoid robot is presented in this paper. The upper body humanoid robot consists of 15 degrees 
of freedom (dof) and mobile platform consists of 2 actuated wheels. The kinematic control strategies along with PID 
controllers are implemented using two separate loops for the upper body and mobile robot controls. Simulations are 
carried out to prove the advantages of the proposed control algorithm for a wheeled humanoid robot.

1. Introduction
Motion tracking control of robots with less computational efforts is very difficult to achieve due to the presence of 
large number of control parameters and constraints. There are different types of linear and nonlinear motion tracking 
control strategies available in the area of wheeled humanoid robot control. Various linear and nonlinear model 
predictive controllers for mobile robots using model predictive control schemes are presented by Nascimento et al. 
(2018). Tracking control strategy suitable for holonomic and non-holonomic mobile robot is illustrated by Sharma et 
al. (2020). The robot is considered as a double integrator system. The proposed algorithm is tested using three mobile 
robots in real time and can be extended to more number of robots. The control strategy adopted for a non-holonomic 
mobile platform to track a given object using image processing technique is given by Wang et al. (2009). Lyapunov 
method and computed torque control method are combined together to form a hybrid control algorithm. The control 
inputs are based on torque values and outputs are the poses of the robot. Ali and Mailah (2019) illustrated the mobile 
robot motion control using a robust controller. The path followed by the mobile robot is determined using a novel 
approach called laser simulation technique. The kinematic and dynamic model is incorporated into the control model 
to reduce the controlling errors. The balancing control of a humanoid robot is presented by Abi-Farraj et al. (2019). 
Most of the conventional balancing algorithms control the COM of the robot. However, in this paper authors used 
gravitational and inertial wrench parameters to control the torque of various joints of the humanoid robot during 
motion. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is tested with forces up to 250 N and the control algorithm is found 
to be efficient. Ficht and Behnke (2020) presented the whole body motion control of a humanoid robot. The mass of 
the body is distributed to the limbs as well as trunk portions and used for determining the joint angles employing 
kinematic equations. The proposed approach reduces the computational time for determining the inverse solutions as 
well as control the motions of the robot. The proposed control strategy can be combined together with feedback 
methods to increase the efficiency of the controller in future works. A robust controller is introduced by Ibanez et al. 
(2012) to control the manipulation tasks during the motion of a humanoid robot. The ZMP related initial control

The obtained error values are in safe range and the proposed algorithm controls the motions of the mobile platform 
through desired path effectively. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This paper discusses a kinematic control strategy to control the motion of a mobile platform and upper body humanoid 
robot. 15 dof humanoid robot with a non-holonomic platform is controlled using a kinematic control scheme. The 
kinematic equations of the upper body are derived using screw theory approach is used in controller strategy. The 
wheeled platform kinematic equations are derived based on non-holonomic constraints. The separate control loops 
adopted for upper body humanoid robot and mobile robot controls the given task with less computational effort. The 
proposed controller algorithm can be proved as robust controller in the future works by evaluating the performance in 
the presence of external disturbances.

Abstract 
Environmental Quality is crucial factor for the people’s health in the neighborhood. Examining the quality of the 
neighborhood’s environment will play vital role in determining the health and its impact on their lifestyle. The 
aim is to find out vulnerable areas so that diagnostic planning can be taken out in those areas. The analysis helps 
figuring out what can be done on improving quality of life on the residents. In the study, efforts were made to 
collect the information like Environmental Factors, Societal Influence, Neighborhood Management and Healthy 
life. Questionnaire was prepared on the Factors and a survey of 306 samples has been collected on people’s view, 
on the Quality of their Life. This data was analyzed using the statistical tools like JMP, excel and SPSS, for getting 
view on the Quality of the environment in the neighborhood. The variables are considered and the descriptive 
statistics, correlation, regression and hypothesis testing are drawn out of the 306 samples. The local authorities if 
they come forward to implement workshops, health education, drainage system, common public toilet, less carbon 
emission and common parking centers, will have positive impact on quality of life and which in turn has impact on 
society and finally benefits the whole country.

Introduction
Life of people depends on the environment they live in and the neighborhood they stay in. Quality of life can be 
characterized into two parts; one is mental and other one is physical (Nematchoua, M., Sadeghi, M. and Reiter, S., 
2022). Mental quality depends on the people manners and their way of thinking, whereas the physical quality 
consists of how the natural resources are used, waste managed, Community and mainly the availabilities in the 
neighborhood like Ambulance, help desk, community parks and so on. And how these facilities are maintained for 
wellbeing of the people in the neighborhood. By finding out the mental and physical Quality of life in different 
neighborhood which will help the people to improve their health and lifestyle. 
Rapid growth in Urbanization and increase in population as led to the depletion of the environment and shortage in 
housing and public services. Urbanization played an important role in developing slums and haphazard land use. 
This urbanization also has surpassed to make available the adequate basic services like water supply, sanitation,

1. Introduction:
Sensors and sensing systems (SASS) are one of the most widely utilized systems in the world, and their application 
and demand are growing all the time. SASS is a sensing, controlling, monitoring, feedback, data storage, and data 
transfer system. A sensor is a component that can be used to measure a variety of physical and chemical properties. It 
also records, indicates and responds. Sensors turn the quantity being sensed into electrical impulses, which are then 
sent to the system. A sensing system is a set of sensors and electronic and electrical components that are used to carry 
out a specific task and its processes. 
SASS is now playing a major role in the manufacturing industry, healthcare, research, and the industrial sector, among 
other. It is mostly employed because of its characteristics, which include system accuracy, precision, standards, 
advanced technology, continuous improvement, error-free operations, system feasibility, a wide range of applications, 
and a variety of data transmission and storage methods (Chehri et al., 2020). 
As sensors and sensing systems are so crucial, they should be utilized to their full potential (Zahedi et al., 2021). The 
study focuses on the main enablers of sensors and sensing systems due to the importance and range of applications 
(Hakki and Ibrahim 2021). Enablers are the system's key functions, and their utilization improves the system. By 
reviewing and referring to research publications, different enablers were found and categorized into different 
categories for evaluation. Fifteen enablers were determined and classified into three different categories that is 1st 
Improvement, 2nd Technology and 3rd Feasibility and cost effectiveness. Key enablers are identified using the 
Pythagorean fuzzy AHP method. This method determines relative weights and ranking is decided. 
2. Literature Review
In sensors and sensing systems, data collecting is one of the most important phases, and data transmission should be 
error-free (Walaa et al., 2020). For the measurement of various quantities, various sensing and controlling components 
are connected to the internet of things (Chang and Martin 2021). In the medical field, a new strategy to improving 
system response can be designed (Zahedi et al., 2021). As its accuracy, dependability, and efficiency, SASS is 
employed in manufacturing systems for atomized manufacturing processes employing sensor feedback control (Xiaa 
et al., 2020). The system requires constant improvement and an effective solution; several methods for transmitting 
data with the optimum energy efficiency are being investigated (Chehri et al., 2020). 
Internet of Things has to deal with many issues while incorporating with devices having insufficient computing 
capacity, which impact on privacy and security. Block chain secure interface technology is used in IOT to avoid signal 
control authority (Marko et al., 2021). To overcome system demands, advancement should be done in sensing systems 
where a new technology specific integrated circuit is implemented (Hakki and Ibrahim 2021). Protection and fault 
detection in data transmission is essential for any system; a new technology name high voltage direct current is used 
(Dimitrios et al., 2020). While considering system demand its quality should not be compromised, hence technology

5. Conclusion: 
Taking into account the importance and diversity of Sensors and sensing systems application. The system's 
improvement and stability must be maintained. The Pythagorean fuzzy AHP approach is utilized for multi-criteria 
decision-making and enabler identification. The key enablers identified are technology, feasibility, and cost 
effectiveness. Block chain safe interface into an iot, robust design, wireless data service, cost effective solution, 
and mobile (Smartphone) as a healthcare device are among the top enablers. For their enhancement, these enablers 
can be incorporated in any sensors and sensing system. As a block chain secure interface, it provides security and 
privacy to the system. Robust design contributes to improved performance and lower maintenance costs. Wireless 
data transmission is becoming one of the most efficient ways to send data. If SASS is implemented, the cost of 
the applicable system will be reduced. As long as a mobile device is connected to SASS, novel and one-of-a-kind 
solutions can be created. All of these enablers will contribute to the enhancement of various SASS.

Abstract 
Now a days, there is an enormous requirement for the development of robotic arms having different number of Degrees 
of Freedom (DOF), which can be employed in human conditions. Robots are work profiles that have somehow become 
a replica to humans. In this project, a robotic arm is designed with 5 DOF’s (3 translational and 2 rotational 
movements) which imitates human hand. Motion sensors are used to detect hand movements. A wireless 
communication module is used for transmission of hand gestures to the robotic arm. The parts of the Robotic arm 
were designed by using CATIA (V5 R21) software. Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) is the material choosen 
for 3D printing of Robotic arm in order to obtain the required parts. A suction cup is used as the end-effector, which 
holds the objects with the help of vacuum motor. Vacuum mechanism works on the principle of Chameleon tongue. 
In order to acquire movement of Robotic arm as human sensitivity, Arduino programming is used. The usage of robots 
has been increasing gradually. Many industries and online marketers widely use robotic labour. This arm has its 
application in picking and placing objects of delicate and sensitive objects.

1. Introduction
Robotics is an era of machine science. Human work is deliberately done efficiently by robots. Robotics is a 
combination of science, technology and engineering, that produce`s machines that replicate human actions.  
Robot: The term ‘Robot’ is taken from a Czech word ‘robota’, that means forced labourer. A robot is simply a machine 
resembling a human being that can replicate certain human movements. Different robots are used for different tasks. 
Robotic Arm: A robotic arm is a kind of mechanical arm that is in general programmable. It consists of a series of 
joints, articulations, and manipulators that work together in order to closely resemble the movements and functionality 
of a human arm, at the least from a mechanical perspective. The arm itself can be the complete mechanism or just a 
part of a much more complex robot. Robotic arms are now often being used across a broad range of industries and 
sectors that include manufacturing, automated assembly, industrial automation, laboratories, machine feeding, testing 
& sample handling etc. A robotic arm consists of links connected through joints that resemble the shoulder, elbow, 
and wrist of a human hand, forming an open kinematic chain. End effectors are devices that are fitted to the end of 
robot arms in order to perform various tasks. These may be Grippers or Tools. 
Various components of a robotic arm system: 
The components used for robotic arm were displayed in Figure 1.

9.4 Coding 
Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is used for coding. In this IDE, embedded C programming is 
used to write the codes. The code is given to the brain of the robotic arm i.e., the microcontroller. The codes are given 
accordingly to the accelerometers for the recognition of the movements. Later, this analog information is now receiver 
by the Zigbee module. This acts as a transmitter and coded accordingly. Now, the other Zigbee module receives the 
command from the microcontroller connected to it and this sends the command to the respective Servomotors. This 
entire setup acts as the receiver unit. 
 
10. Applications & Future Scope 
Applications: 
• 
Pick and place of objects. 
• 
Handling sensitive and delicate parts like eggs, papers, etc. 
• 
Industrial usage and for medical purposes like handling tools during surgeries. 
Future scope: 
• 
The end-effector used here is Vacuum gripper and for future scope, other end-effectors such as tools can be 
used based on the application. Zigbee module is near range communication. It can be replaced with Wi-Fi module 
for far range communication. Image processing can be incorporated for advanced applications. The material used 
here is ABS plastics. But it can be replaced by metals like Aluminium, etc to increase the pay load.

Abstract 
Direct Methanol Fuel Cells are considered a notably high promising one amongst energy sources in the renewable 
energy sector. Its ion or proton-conducting electrolyte is based exclusively on polymer electrolyte membrane fuel 
cell technology. Fuel cell components and their durability are affected by methanol solution, its concentration, 
evaporative conditions of water, carbon dioxide evaluation, heat generation, and its sealing components. Non-
Destructive Testing is performed on Passive Direct Methanol Fuel Cell components to evaluate their performance 
and to ascertain their reliability, serviceability, durability, expected life &healthiness. Non-Destructive Testing such 
as Visual Testing, Liquid Penetrant Testing, Ultrasonic Thickness measurement, hardness measurement, and 
metallographic examination is used to identify direct or indirect means to find the size and to locate surface and 
subsurface discontinuities in the materials and components. The materials and components have been examined 
using Non-Destructive Testing, evaluated, and interpreted for acceptance/rejection or repair and to assure 
components' safety and reliability.

1. Introduction
A fuel cell converts the chemical energy of reactants into electrical energy (electricity) besides other reaction 
products (Ryan et al. 2016). It is one of the electrical power sources similar to a conversion device like a battery 
(Bincy et al. 2021). It differs from a battery in that it produces electricity continuously as long as the fuel and 
oxidant are supplied (Raghavaiah et al. 2022). It has advantages like clean by-products, extremely no/low emission 
of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur (Beatriz et al. 2020), operates quietly, does not have any moving parts, extra fuel 
processing to meet demand requirements, and high energy density (Raghavaiah et al. 2020). Methanol is a 
commonly used fuel for Passive Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (PDMFC). Methanol is relatively inexpensive and easily 
available as a fuel, has a high specific energy density, quick refueling, and good transport and storage facility (Boni 
et al. 2020). The cell process operates at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure without adding additional 
liquid electrolyte requirements (Braz et al. 2020). Compacted fuel cell design allows it exclusively for porTable 
applications and easy handling (Junoh, 2020).  
1.1 Objectives 
Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) is used to identify direct and/or indirect means to find the size and locate surface 
and subsurface discontinuities in the materials and components of Passive direct methanol fuel cells. The cell with 
labeled components is shown in figure 1. The materials and components examined using NDT are interpreted for 
acceptance/rejection or repair and assure the safety and reliability of components (Raghavaiah, 2019). Various Non-
Destructive Testing such as Visual Testing (VT), Liquid Penetrant Testing (PT), Ultrasonic Testing (UT) for 
Thickness measurement, hardness measurement, metallographic examination, etc., on Passive Direct Methanol Fuel 
Cell components are chosen based on the mode of failures and are considered in this analysis to ascertain their 
serviceability, durability, expected life, and healthiness.

5. Discussion  
Non-Destructive Testing such as Visual Testing, Liquid Penetrant Testing, Ultrasonic Testing for Thickness 
measurement, hardness measurement, and metallographic examination is performed on Passive Direct Methanol 
Fuel Cell components to evaluate their performance and to ascertain their serviceability, durability, expected life & 
healthiness. Non-Destructive Testing is used to identify direct or indirect means to find the size and to locate surface 
and subsurface discontinuities. The materials and components have been examined using Non-Destructive Testing 
and interpreted for acceptance/rejection or repair and to assure components' safety and reliability.  
 
6. Results and Conclusions  
Passive Direct Methanol Fuel Cell is considered a notably high promising one amongst energy sources in the 
renewable energies sector. Its ion or proton-conducting electrolyte is based totally on polymer electrolyte membrane 
fuel cell technology. Fuel cell components and their durability are affected by methanol solution, its concentration, 
evaporative conditions of water, carbon dioxide evaluation, heat generation, and its sealing components. The 
concluded results of the identified Service-Oriented Degradations using Non-Destructive Testing Methods on 
Passive Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Components are tabulated in Table 4.

Abstract 
This study proposes a quantitative evaluation model for comparative analysis of installed renewable energy (RE) 
capacity development in seven north-eastern states of India. The north-eastern states of India have a hilly terrain and 
have high potential for renewable energy sources. Hence, they receive special attention as far as renewable energy 
capacity development is concerned. Performance indicators (PIs) are constructed to capture RE development status. 
Then a combination of modified CRITIC and VIKOR methods is used for getting the rankings for the selected states 
based on data collected for the PIs. The yearly trends of performance scores for five PIs of RE capacity development 
included in the evaluation index are compared with yearly trend of performance rank for all the selected states. This 
is critical for obtaining meaningful insights to identify weaker performance areas among state(s) considering relative 
performance ranks. Model helps in planning the expansion of RE projects by identifying the development trends in 
areas that are performing better than others and pinpointing concern for the areas that are lagging behind on a relative 
scale.

1. Introduction
The focus on clean source of energy is the need of the hour so that CO2 emission is reduced and extreme climate 
alterations are avoided. India aims to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-
fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 and renewable energy (RE) will play a critical role in this context 
(Kharesaxena et al. 2020). India has achieved a cumulative installed RE capacity of 175 Gigawatts (GW) by adding 
20 GW in 2021 (highest 12-month capacity addition till date) and has set an ambitious target of meetting 40% of its 
total energy demand through RE by 2030 (MNRE, 2020). The north-eastern states of India have a hilly terrain and 
have high potential for renewable energy sources. Hence, they receive special attention as far as renewable energy 
capacity development is concerned. A separate budgetary allocation of 10% is reserved for the these states under 
various Renewable Energy programmes for deployment of grid and off-grid Solar Energy Systems, Wind Energy 
Systems, Small Hydro Projects and Bio-gas Plants among others, in the region. A total of estimated potential for 
renewable energy in the north-eastern region from solar, small hydro and bio-energy is around 65,837 MW, a 
substantial part of which is suitable for grid connected applications (ENVIS, 2022). A comparative evaluation of the 
development of RE capacity in north-eastern Indian states must be done for establishing proper understanding of 
development trends and thereby enabling proper planning for the same. Hence, a quantitative evaluation model for 
the same is proposed in this paper.  
Firstly, based on the RE development data in the reports published on Ministry of New and Renewable Energy 
(MNRE) Website (https://mnre.gov.in/knowledge-center/publication) for India, this paper constructs a set of five 
performance indicators (PIs) for evaluating the RE development status in a state. These PIs are explained in Table 1. 
Then an integrated quantitative approach is developed to evaluate and analyse the relative RE capacity development 
for a state on a year-to-year basis for three years. Modified CRITIC (criteria importance through inter-criteria 
correlation) method is adopted to assign weights to the various PIs and then VIKOR method is used to obtain the state 
ranks based on the state-wise data collected against the constructed PIs. The reasons behind an improvement or 
deterioration in rank of a state over three years are identified by comparing the trend of performance score under all 
the PIs for that state with the trend of compromisded ranks for that state. The rational behind using CRITIC and 
VIKOR in the proposed framework is explained in subsequent paragraph.

5. Conclusion  
North-eastern Indian states has a large untapped potential of clean energy generation through RE and has set ambitious 
plans for harnessing it. Comparative analysis of installed RE capacity development in these states shall help in 
planning the expansion of RE projects by identifying the development trends in states that are performing better than 
others and pinpointing areas of concern for the states that are lagging behind on a relative scale. This study proposes 
and empirically validates a quantitative evaluation model for assessing the same.     
 
The combination of modified CRITIC and VIKOR methods is used for getting the compromised rankings for the 
selected states. The yearly trends of performance scores for five PIs of RE capacity development included in the 
evaluation index are compared with yearly trend of performance rank for all the selected states. This is critical for 
obtaining meaningful insights to identify weaker performance areas among state(s) considering relative performance 
ranks. Finally, the suggested framework, a combination of modified CRITIC, VIKOR, acts as an effective tool for the 
evaluation of RE development status in various geographical alternatives.  
 
We conclude by highlighting possible extensions of the study. First, while the study has been undertaken based on 
secondary data from north-eastern states of India, the proposed framework can be easily generalized using RE 
development data from other geographical alternatives. Second, a more robust evaluation index system can be 
developed by including a larger number of input parameters and PIs. This will help in creating a region-specific 
evaluation index system. Thus, the governments and policymakers can use the insights for enhancing the utilization 
of RE potential through proper planning of RE development.

Abstract 
Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is spread around 713 Sq. Km area with total population of 1.3 Crore, 
generates around 4,500 Metric tons per day of domestic solid waste at an average of 309 grams in city and from slum is 
300 grams per day. In metropolitan areas, a huge quantity of household solid waste is generated, which contains a variety 
of materials such as organic wastes, paper, plastic, metal, glass, and so on. To promote this process, the government 
developed the concept of waste segregation encouraging people to dispose trash separately for efficient waste 
management. Because of no proper segregation at source, currently 15% of garbage is treated and remaining is being 
dumped into landfills. Considering above problem, the proposed system will have track on whether collected domestic 
waste is segregated or not. To have track on waste segregation we have designed QR code tags and smartphone 
application. QR tags contain information of electric meter number, using smartphone application waste collector can 
scan the QR tags to fetch the electric meter number, in the designed application dashboard it contains fields like kind of 
waste, segregation status and so on. According to the segregation status waste collector should upload photo of the waste 
to have proper tracking. If waste is not segregated processing become tedious and waste will be dumped into landfills. 
Pollution of air, water and soil can be considerably reduced when waste is separated and treated.

1. Introduction
India has second highest population in the world, Contributing 17.6% of world’s population. Globally, Indians create over 
2.01 billion tons of solid trash each year, according to World Bank estimates. 377 million people reside in 7935 cities 
and towns, producing 62 million tons of trash every year. Only 43 million tons of trash are accumulated, 11.9 million 
tons are handled, and 31 million tons are dumped in landfills. Trash disposal was not a serious issue for decades because 
the population was low and there was plenty of available space for dumpsites. However, now it has become a major 
issue everywhere. 
With an estimated population of 8.4 million people, Bangalore generates roughly 4,500 metric tons of municipal solid 
trash every day at an average of 0.5 kilograms per day. Only around 60% of garbage is collected, and only about 15% of 
waste is treated before being buried in landfills. While recycling in Bangalore's urban and rural areas has yet to meet 
final goals, landfills, trash burning, and illegal dumping are all too commonly found everywhere. for Current year BBMP 
total budget outlay is put at Rs 10,480.9 crore, a substantial increase from last year’s total of Rs 9,286 crore. Two-thirds 
of the budget, Rs 6,911.5 crore, has been set aside for the Public Works Department (PWD). 
The collected solid waste from houses is brought to a common point, i.e., secondary locations from where the waste is 
transferred to landfill sites/treatment through tipper lorries and compactors. A typical scheme of how the collection and 
transportation are being practiced in most of the wards. in many wards it indicated that no norms/guidelines had been 
followed in setting up waste segregation practices adopted in this ward. There is a lack of awareness among people that 
leads to confusion. The waste collectors (pourakarmikas) lack training in proper segregation practices and its importance. 
Incomplete segregation is the predominant practice currently, and steps to realize a higher level of compliance and 
efficiency need to be affected. Figure 1 below shows the division total waste in 2021 and Figure 2 shows the anticipated 
(forecasted waste in the next 20 years) 
Motivation of research is to 1. Reduce the landfills space 2. Segregating waste at home as it is easy 3. To overcome 
inefficient municipal solid waste management 4. Waste disposal effects on BBMP worker’s health.

Figure 8. Logistic regression result 
The dependent variable taken is If BBMP makes mandatory to buy QR code printed waste collection bags or dustbins in 
order to track segregation, will you buy, the number of observations indicates the number of responses obtained from 
the survey. P>|z| indicates that if it any of the parameter is within 0.05 it affects the dependent variable. 
5.2 Proposed Improvements 

The study can also be carried out at various other geographical areas

The collected sample size for the project undertaken is can be a larger sample size

It is suggested to use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve segregation. This can be designed to
reduce  human intervention in segregating waste

Image processing capability can be used to determine the kind of waste using machine learning.

It is suggested to introduce smart bin concept.

The current application require internet, in future it can be implemented in offline mode.

Conclusion
Door to Door step of collecting waste from people by sending BBMP vehicles separate for both dry and wet waste has 
not been completely effective. Arguments between BBMP workers and the residents have been reported over gathering 
of unsegregated waste. Employees have been facing too much difficulty to separate the waste later once all the waste has 
been collected. And because of the mixed waste it is also becoming difficult to recycle reuse and causing problems while 
land filing too. This is leading to pilling up of wastes in the landfills and leading to more and more illegal dumpsites in 
the city consuming more space to dump the waste. 
Mixed waste makes it difficult to worker, as it requires much manual or mechanical sorting this puts workers health in 
danger especially hazardous waste can cause long term health problems as well as time taking and the waste that are 
been dumped in the compressor are not completely segregated. Due to unsegregated waste that has been collected

the process of compressing becomes more difficult and segregating them will be time taking and leading to pile up of 
waste in the wards. 
The waste that are collected by BBMP are then compressed and taken to landfills and dumpsites far away from the 
residential area but due to the improper waste segregation and recycling process the landfills are getting piled up leading 
to giving rise of illegal dumpsites and covering more space and time to waste management. 
Communities surrounding landfills are facing issues with their drinking water due to leaking landfills that is caused 
because of improper segregation wet waste and dry waste again as well as workers health and hygiene are affected even 
more. 
The detail analysis has been done with the help of collected responses through well-structured questionnaires to and 
from that we came to know that in most of the areas waste segregation is not happening and that increases the amount of 
waste that reaches to the landfill. to identify these, we have developed a smart phone application and also designed a QR 
code tags to scan the dustbins.

Abstract 
Manual material handling (MMH) and lifting activities are believed to contribute to the risk of low back pain (LBP). 
It has been found that as many as 50% of all back pains may be related to manual lifting activities. Revised NIOSH 
lifting equation (RNLE) was designed to reduce the incidence of LBP by recommending safe load limits, called the 
recommended load limit (RWL).  While, an effect of worker characteristics like age, gender, weight and ethnicity, on 
load lifting task has been seen, the RNLE considers the effect of task demands only for establishing the RWLs. Thus, 
the present study investigates the role of worker anthropometry in a manual lifting task. The findings have been 
discussed in the light of the RNLE. A psychophysical methodology was adopted to arrive at the maximum acceptable 
weight limits (MAWLs). 50 industrial workers (25 males and 25 females) participated in the study. ANCOVA for 
gender using acromial height and wrist circumference as covariates showed that while acromial height and wrist 
circumference had a statistically significant effect on MAWL, gender did not. Further, it was observed that the using 
psychophysical criteria of 75% capable females (as per the RNLE guidelines), resulted in a MAWL of 22.2. kgs, 
which is comparable to the recommended weight limit (RWL) of 23 kg as obtained by the RNLE.

1. Introduction
Low back pain (LBP) is pervasive in modern society, with a global lifetime prevalence of approximately 40% (Coenen 
et al., 2014). According to Hoy et al. it is the greatest contributor to global disability in terms of years lived with 
disability (Hoy et al., 2014). Though LBP is an issue in both occupational and non-occupational settings, its 
consequences are severe in the occupational setting. Besides, human suffering, economic consequences of LBP 
include productivity-loss at work, sickness absence and disability. 
A review of literature spanning 10 years (1997-2007), placed the estimated LBP cost between $84.1 to $624.8 billion 
(Dagenais et al., 2008).MMH tasks have often been associated with low-back pain (LBP), one of the costliest injuries 
with occupational origins. Statistical findings suggest that about 50% of all back pain are related to manual lifting 
(Afshari et al., 2017a). According to a report by national institute for occupational safety and health (NIOSH), about 
60% of compensations arising from physical damages are related to the activity of manual load lifting (Afshari et al., 
2017b). 
Lifting involves the various human joints in a complex manner. The external force applied by the load to be lifted is 
shared primarily by the low back, hip and knee joints. The relative proportions of their sharing are also influenced by 
human factors (age, sex, body dimensions, strength of various involved muscles etc.), task factors (load, posture 
awkwardness, location of load, lift frequency, speed of lifting, size of container, coupling etc.), and environmental 
factors (temperature, humidity, ventilation, noise etc.).

4. Conclusions
The results of the present study indicate that while anthropometric characteristics of acromial height and wrist 
circumference had a significant effect on MAWL, gender did not have a statistically significant effect on it, when 
acromial height and wrist circumference were taken as covariates. Thus, it appears that acromial height and wrist 
circumference had a more marked effect on MAWL as compared to gender. The present research indicates that 
anthropometric variables may be used to determine safe loads for a given population.  
It was noted that for the task undertaken in the study the MAWL, as per the RNLE criteria, is 22.2 kg which was 
comparable to the RWL of 23 kg as obtained from the RNLE. Thus, it appears that the RWL of RNLE is suitable for 
the Indian population

Abstract 
Supply Chain Management (SCM) has assumed a significant interest both for academia and industry. The course on 
SCM attracts a wide interest from the student community, especially from institutes like IITs. Typical principles of 
quality management like customer focus, team working, involvement of all and continuous improvement were 
utilized in the design and implementation of a course on SCM at IIT Delhi. Typically, the course used to be offered 
in physical mode. However, with Covid-19, online teaching became the “new normal”. The SCM course is no 
exception to this. The present paper is an attempt to share experiences while teaching the SCM course in the online 
mode. Students responded to the challenge of self-managing teams and empowerment. Several improvements 
regarding the content and delivery were introduced for the course based on a PDCA philosophy of continuous 
improvement. Various editions of the course (like before the Covid-19 pandemic, and post Covid-19) offered 
various challenges as well as opportunities for the enhancing teaching-learning process. The paper concludes with a 
discussion of various implications for pedagogy.

1. Introduction
The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused extraordinary challenges in the global education sector. 
Most countries temporarily closed educational institutions to contain the spread of the virus and reduce infections. In 
India, the move to online teaching and learning methods accelerated because of the physical closure of universities 
and university colleges in March 2020.IIT Delhi was no exception to this.  
IIT Delhi is one of the leading institutes of technology in India. It has also been recognized as an Institute of 
Eminence by the Ministry of Education, Government of India. IIT Delhi offers various undergraduate and graduate 
programs through academic units such as departments and centres. The Mechanical Engineering Department (MED) 
of IIT Delhi is internationally renowned. In recent QS ratings, it stands at 64th rank globally and 2nd rank in India. 
MED offers various undergraduate and postgraduate programmes besides doctoral programmes. IIT Delhi follows a 
semester system. Typically, in a semester, about 55-60 courses are offered by MED under various academic 
programmes.  Each course is codified. One such course is MCL756: Supply Chain Management. 
This paper is a report on the author’s experiences in teaching this course, in online mode, especially during the 
pandemic period due to Covid-19. The course on SCM was introduced following an extensive curriculum revision 
exercise carried out in 2003-2004 at IIT Delhi. Accordingly, the course was offered for master’s students of 
Industrial engineering (MEE) in 2004. The course was a core course for the MEE. Students of other disciplines used 
to take this course as an elective.

f) 
The application of PDCA enabled to make improvements in the prevailing Covid-19 environment. This was 
necessary in the absence of face-to-face interactions with students.   
g) Technology platforms in a smart classroom setting can enhance the teacher student experience when both can 
see each other creating a virtual class room experience.  
We have not only facilitated and coached students in the SCM course but have also applied some of the lessons 
learned in the course to other courses as well (For example a course on Industrial Engineering systems (for students 
of the MEE programme), or Statistics for Manufacturing Managers).

Abstract 
Human kinematic analysis remains one of the most challenging tasks for the researchers. In a typical gait analysis 
study, measurement of various joint angles is carried out with the help of markers attached to the human body. 
The human activity is captured by a video camera and the video is then analyzed using appropriate software. 
Locating the markers manually in each frame is cumbersome and may give erroneous results. The problems like, 
motion blur, scattering, marker occlusion, marker reflection, etc., are also prevalent. The video recording settings 
play an important role in deciding the marker location precisely. In the present study, the effects of input 
parameters such as frame rate and shutter speed, on the pixel area of the LED marker were investigated using the 
Response Surface Methodology (RSM). It has been observed that higher shutter speed time has a negative effect 
on pixel area of the LED marker and on the area of the bounding box. The experimentation using RSM showed 
that shutter speed time of 2300 µsec and frame rate of 60 Frame Per Second (FPS) are required to produce pixel 
area of bounding box of desired quality.

1. Introduction
Gait analysis is a critical technique for measuring human movement patterns in order to acquire a better 
understanding of a number of health-related issues, gait recognition, pathological gait, etc. Spatiotemporal gait 
parameters obtained by gait analysis have clinical and biomechanical research applications. While human 
kinematic analysis (HKA) is a common biomechanics research topic, numerous approaches for evaluating gait 
parameters have been developed over the years. Edward Muybridge, a well-known landscape photographer of 
America, developed the first photographic technique for measurement. He took a bunch of pictures of horse 
trotting and later proved that there are times when all of horse's limbs are in the air at the same time. Marey refined 
the process and developed the world's first cine camera (Baker 2007). A method suited to study of gait is described 
in which the person movements is captured from front and side, with the help of camera. Triangulation techniques 
are used in obtaining measurements from the captured video. Video captured is then digitize, first technique of 
digitization found out by (Sutherland and Hagy 1972).  
There are many factors, including ambient conditions, that create undesirable effects such as motion blur, 
scattering, etc., in video recording. Aside from wireless sensors that monitor spatial-temporal parameters or 
orientation, video recording is a technology that is often used in research and development. A video recording 
enables for the examination of the same activity by many researchers at different times, as well as the inspection 
of video at different speeds and settings to show movements that are too quick for the human eye to detect with 
its normal vision (Egnor and Branson 2016). A new algorithm to calculate gait spatiotemporal parameters by 
tracking estimated joint locations is presented by (Zhu et al., 2022). A ""mobile Video Enhanced Gait Analysis 
System"" (mVEGAS) based on combination of body-fixed inertial sensors and a smartphone camera mounted on 
the trunk was presented by (Ippisch et al., 2022). The researchers describe the gait analysis device's hardware and 
software components and its analysis processes for evaluating spatiotemporal gait metrics.  
However, despite significant advancements in video-based HKA, the accuracy of the technique remains 
undetermined. A variety of elements, such as camera configuration, camera resolution, illumination, walking 
speed, occlusion and background, among others, influence accuracy (Noldus et al., 2002).

Figure 14. Numerical Optimization of bounding box area 
6. Conclusion 
The effects of motion blur, dispersion, and reflection of the LED marker on the overall accuracy of object detection 
in video footage are all significant. In this experiment, it was discovered that by using lower shutter speed time 
settings, the sharp LED object in a video frame is produced. Furthermore, as the frame rate value is increased, the 
bounding box area increases as well. The number of frames grows in proportion to the increase in the value of the 
frame rate. Finally, the optimal value of the input parameters is established, which results in a sharp image of the 
LED marker as well as the optimal conditions in which the LED marker image can operate.

Abstract 
It is necessary to be aware of both the costs and the advantages associated with the adoption of ISO 14000 certification 
in an organisation in order to conduct an accurate evaluation of the investment with regard to the state of the financial 
performance. On the other hand, as we will see, calculating these figures can be challenging, mostly because there is 
a dearth of reference data or particular evaluation criteria. This paper investigates the effect of iso 14001 certification 
on firm performance using Indian public listed manufacturing firms financial data from CMIE prowess data base using 
the propensity score matching techniques followed by regression analysis. The result indicates that effect of iso 14001 
certification on firm performance is significant. The further investigation reveals that sales coefficient is higher than 
cost for iso 14001 certified firms. This study provides empirical support for policy-makers promoting environmental 
practices that may lead to sustainable economic growth.

1. Introduction
Increasing emphasis on environmental protection and the increasing importance of sustainable development have been 
an important stimulus in the development of the ISO 14000 series of environmental management standards. ISO 14001 
has been widely adopted across the world as the standard environmental management system certified by the ISO 
(International Organization for Standardization) (Ambec & Lanoie, 2008). ISO 14001 certification can be used as an 
active tool for promoting comprehensive organizational changes leading to SD (Sebhatu et al., 2007). However, Iso 
14001 certification or adoption is a strategic investment decision taken by an organisation to improve operational 
efficiency, environmental concern and unlock valuable insights to minimize wastage.  
Implementing ISO 14000 certification in a business involves a number of expenses and benefits that must be 
understood in order to evaluate the investment objectively. when it comes to environmental quality investment may 
appear to be costly at times, but there are returns that are often economically significant quantifiable. Such benefits 
are dependent on the selection and pursuit of goals, the observance of rules (e.g., no omissions), and environmental 
efficiency (e.g., no waste), and can only be determined after an in-depth investigation (Alberti et al., 2000). It has been 
determined that major organisational motives for the adoption of EMS include the following: meeting the demands of 
customers, complying with the requirements of regulatory agencies, seeking cost reduction and efficiency 
improvement, and searching for competitive advantages (Prajogo et al., 2012; Teng et al., 2018; Treacy et al, 2019).  
However, the fact that the existing literature has investigated the influence of ISO 14001 adoption on firm 
performance, the conclusions are inconclusive. According to several studies, adopting the ISO 14001 standard will 
increase a company's environmental performance. Others have discovered neutral performance in terms of return on 
assets (ROA) and return on capital (ROCE) (Ali et. al., 2010; Wenlong et al, 2015; Jacobs et al., 2010; Nishitani, 
2011).ISO 14001 implementation can have positive or negative effects on a company's performance (Erauskin‐Tolosa 
et al., 2020; Hazudin et al., 2015; Heras-Saizarbitoria et al, 2011; King & Lenox, 2001). Firms that embrace the ISO 
14001 standard, in particular, are recognised as environmentally friendly; as a result, they might enjoy differential

Overall, the regression results show that ISO 14001 adoption certification has equal size but varied potential beneficial 
effects on sales and expenses. As a result, sales growth may not be offset by comparable costs. This is why the 
discovery explains the substantial effects of ISO 14001 adoption on financial performance.  
4. Conclusion and Implication
In the fast-paced and ever-changing world of modern business, an organization's primary focus should be on 
maximising its resource utilisation in order to get a strategic edge over its rivals. The ISO 14001 certification confers 
significant benefits on every company in terms of economic benefits. The findings of this research show that the 
advantages of adhering to the ISO 14001 standard go far beyond the improvements in corporate legitimacy that can 
be achieved by doing so. This was demonstrated by better operating performance in comparison to those who did not 
implement. In our result financial benefits due to operating performance, because sales and cost is directly corelated 
with same magnitude, however we found that iso 14001 certified firms has higher sales and cost but magnitude of cost 
is smaller than sales. Which indicates that Iso 14001 certifications helps firm to get operational efficient by reducing 
wastage or by improving operational process. 
The management should be aware that there are performance benefits associated with ISO 14001 that go far beyond 
the benefits associated with marketing. More precisely, the results imply that standards such as ISO 14001 can enhance 
operating performance by applying operating procedures which promote a mindset of waste reduction and continual 
improvement. Because the findings presented here suggest that the integration and diffusion of ISO 14001 
environmental practises can help build operating capabilities that lead to both cost efficiency gains and operating 
speed gains, management should incorporate ISO 14001 alongside a culture of cost control and collaboration amongst

business functions. This is because the findings suggest that the integration and diffusion of ISO 14001 environmental 
practises can help build operating capabilities. 
 
In sum, our findings have consequences for spending decisions related to ISO 14001. The majority of publicly traded 
corporations (approximately half) have chosen to become ISO 14001 certified. According to our research, pursuing 
ISO 14001 certification is a good way to improve operational efficiency and get a competitive edge. Efforts in India 
to achieve ISO 14001 certification are, therefore, commendable. 
 
This study found that ISO 14001 improves a firm intellectual aspect. ISO 14001 improved capital performance and 
operating procedures like cost control and operational coordination. Future research should examine the relationship 
between ISO 14001 procedures and intellectual capital, since it may have human, relational, process, and innovation 
benefits.

Development of a Framework to Assess the Impact 
of Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) Deployment in Supply Chain Management (SCM)

Abstract 
Rapid technology advances and dynamic market forces have altered the business landscape as also fundamentally 
altered existing business models. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) usage and deployment have 
opened the doors for enterprises to compete in any marketplace. ICT tools are great enablers, enhancers, levelers, and 
facilitators of enterprise operations. While most researchers and industry practioners are unanimous about the fact that 
ICT positively impacts Supply Chain Management (SCM) performance and improves supply chain capabilities, there 
is evidently an identified gap in terms of assessment and measurement of these ICT benefits and capabilities in SCM. 
This is despite the fact that there are several SCM performance measurement frameworks. The novel research direction 
of this investigation emerged from the observation that there is clearly an absence of an assessment framework to 
accurately describe the impact and benefit analysis and to what magnitude ICT has improved the competitive 
advantage of enterprises through the improvement of the enterprise supply chain. This research work assumes greater 
significance as a result of the present situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the need for 
Industry 4.0, digitalization, and embracing of ICT not only for the supply chain but also for all aspects of the enterprise. 
The motivation of this thesis is to make an original contribution to the body of knowledge in terms of addressing this 
gap in the rubrics of ICT effectiveness in SCM as also providing enterprises with a benchmark on their ICT 
deployment in SCM. This thesis is about the development of an assessment framework of ICT deployment in SCM, 
consisting of an empirical model and capability index and its dovetailing into the APICS Supply Chain Operations 
Reference (SCOR) model, which has universal appeal and wide acceptance. The rubrics and performance indicators 
of various constructs for measuring the impact of ICT in SCM in the empirical model evolved into an ICT capability 
index metric for SCM. This assessment framework of the benefits of ICT deployment can be used by any enterprise 
irrespective of the geography or country, vertical or sector, manufacturing or services. Measurement of the ICT impact 
on SCM aids decision-making and policymakers as also helps to identify targets and to track and benchmark progress. 
This can also provide insights on the selection of appropriate ICT tools after measurement of its impact on the supply 
chain paradigm and understanding success factors and operational challenges for the adoption of various ICT tools. 
The empirical model uses well-defined metrics from the SCOR process reference model corresponding to supply chain 
processes and performance constructs, thereby providing a robust research methodology. All of the SCOR processes 
and attributes are influenced by ICT, but this model also does not list ICT enablement as a metric of supply chain 
performance. The constructs used are reliability, responsiveness & agility, which are considered customer-facing, and 
cost & assets, which are internal process-facing. With regard to analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using 
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used on the results of the survey questionnaire and semi-structured 
interviews for quantitative and qualitative inputs.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on the issue of heat stress and its adverse effects on animals, specifically livestock, and attempts 
to develop a solution using the Arduino microcontroller. The adverse effects of heat stress towards animals includes 
the deterioration of the reproductive system of animals, abnormalities in eating behaviors, and so on. The researchers 
have developed the schematics and the specifications used for the solution to the heat stress dilemma. The schematics 
include the usage of sensors for humidity and temperature, which can be viewed on a mobile phone application, and 
an automatic feeder which will operate under a certain time set by the user. This is controlled through a mobile 
application which also uses push notifications to notify the user about the conditions of the animals. The researcher 
recommends further analysis through comparison with other products with a similar goal, and additional features to 
further enhance the current schematic. 
Keywords 
Temperature, humidity, sensors, heat stress, mobile application, Arduino. 
1. Introduction
Varying temperatures have different effects on living beings. For example, according to Para, et al. high temperatures 
that cause heat stress towards animals have adverse effects on their behavioral patterns, and food intake. This is 
especially important for livestock, as their food intake and such factors influence the products. Temperature must be 
monitored often to ensure satisfactory outcome. However, a farmer may have scarce time to constantly monitor the 
temperature levels for the livestock. This paper presents an inexpensive solution using microcontrollers, specifically 
Arduino boards. These Arduino boards, through attached sensors, will be able to constantly measure temperature and 
other parameters relevant to livestock care. This data will then be displayed through a mobile phone application. 
Included in this system is an automatic feeder, which alleviates the work done by farmers. The application also informs 
the user of status updates through push notifications on the mobile phone. 
2. Review of Related Literature
2.1 Impact of heat stress on the reproduction of farm animals and strategies to ameliorate it
Heat stress not only depends on temperature but also on humidity. Temperature Humidity Index (THI) is a combination
of humidity and temperature that is measured by the degree of discomfort experienced by an individual in a warm
index, it can also be called the discomfort index. THI is used to maintain the efficiency of the animal to alleviate the
Heat Stress. The common sign of Heat Stress is the increased body temperature, and it is about 39.20°C, panting,
reduced food intake and disturbed behavioral pattern. That is why farms should implement a proper cooling method
when a heat stress occurs. Heat stress can also affect the endocrine function of the body and it can affect the fertility
and reproductive efficiency of the animals. The reproductive efficiency of the dairy cattle that
experienced heat stress, especially in summer, lowered the fertility in dairy cows (Para et al. 2018)

4. Conclusion 
 The adverse effects that heat stress poses to animals may end up resulting in a bad outcome for the farmers that take 
care of them. The researchers have produced a cheap and convenient solution for this problem using Arduino, sensors 
connected to the Arduino board, and other applications such as the mobile application for data viewing and 
customization. This alleviates the workload of the farmers in terms of monitoring and maintenance towards the 
livestock they have. The researchers recommend several details to further improve this research. One is to test the 
diagrams given by the researchers and comparing it to other products that have similar objectives. Comparisons to its 
efficiency to cost will inform readers of the optimal hardware solutions for this problem. Second is to have more 
features that may be useful in growing livestock. At its current state, the solution given by the researchers offers only 
simple parameters.

Abstract 
The current situation of the gaming industry, as well as the effects of e-commerce on traditional gaming products 
commerce, will be discussed in this paper. Its goal is to see if e-commerce will someday supplant the traditional 
method of purchasing games. Previously, gamers had to go to a gaming store to buy a physical copy of the game. 
With the advent of e-commerce, game companies are promoting the use of a digital copy. We'll look at the 
economic tradeoffs between the two methods of acquiring computer-based games, as well as the impact they have 
on the people who buy them and their preferences. We would have figured out how the gaming industry has 
changed at the end of this study. How it got there and how it affects gaming industry stakeholders.

e-commerce, traditional commerce, physical copy, digital copy, computer-based games
1. Introduction
1.1  Gaming Commerce
Digital game distribution allows the delivery of video games without the need for the physical copy such as optical 
disc, ROM cartridges and memory cards. The distribution of games is all done over the internet and provided by
online distributors. Online distributors can deliver these services by creating their digital distribution platform
where game publishers can put their product for sale. In return digital distributors gain a percentage for every
game sold on their platform. The share of gaming sales from digital compared to physical has grown by 63% in
the last 9 years (Clement 2009). Over the previous two decades, both the gaming and e-commerce industries have
experienced consistent expansion. Both businesses are expanding, and the epidemic has contributed to this growth. 
For e-commerce and gaming, social distance and lockdowns have been an opportunity, resulting in a 30 percent
boost in value for both industries. Mobile gaming is now the largest segment of the gaming business, accounting
for over half of total revenue. A similar shift toward mobile experiences has been seen in e-commerce, although
conversion has been tough. Mobile devices account for over 80% of all product discoveries, but just 30% of
conversions. This is because the checkout processes are difficult to use. This is beginning to change, thanks to
mobile wallets, mobile banking, and user-friendly web design (Friberg, J. 2021)
This study aims to identify two main objectives: 
•
The economic impact of digital distribution in the industry
•
The preferences and tradeoffs that consumers are willing to accept
1.2 Rise of e-commerce in gaming 
The distribution of games over the internet has grown increasingly prevalent in recent years. The overall market 
is currently dominated by brick-and-mortar retailers and physical copies, but the online market — which includes 
online distribution of full game titles, subscription-based models, downloadable content, virtual commodities, and 
related value-added services — is rapidly developing. We still know very little about how players feel about digital 
game delivery (Toivonen, S. and Sotamaa, O. 2010). 
The rise in popularity of digital game distribution and the need for delivering games digitally gave the opportunity 
for a new market. Digital game delivery platforms, the leading platforms such are Steam, Epic Games and

Even with the price point set very high for the Ellie Edition it still quickly sold out to many retailers. This was 
unsurprising given the success of the first game, The Last of Us, see figure 3 The many versions spoke to a wide 
range of supporters of the game, from casual gamers to their biggest fans, and offered varying pricing points to fit 
their budgets. I was a great fan of the game, and even though I desired the most expensive choice, it was out of 
my price range. Still, I wanted something more than the usual option and settled on the Special Edition, which 
costs roughly 4,000 Pesos.

An advantage that gamers who prefer physical copies relate to is the sense of ownership that they have. Digital 
copies suffer some disadvantages when it comes to ownership. When you download a game, you’ve only 
purchased a license to play it. Casual phone game “Flappy Bird” was taken off the iOS App Store at the peak of 
its fame in 2014 due to legal troubles, and if you were unfortunate enough to own it but not have the game 
downloaded to a device, it was gone forever. Other notable examples include “Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The 
Game” and “OutRun Online Arcade.” (Zentler 2020) 
 
In a study by Lee et al. (2016), most of the respondents who prefer physical games cherish the sensation of 
ownership, being able to select and showcase their own collection in a way that makes sense to them, and being 
able to share, resell, and trade-in games. The challenge for game content providers will be to provide these needs 
in a new distribution strategy with digital games. This is crucial because an increasing number of content providers 
argue for distribution strategies that provide ""access"" to content rather than the media objects themselves (through 
subscription-based or streaming models). While digital games provide many advantages, many respondents 
believed that they did not provide the same experience as physical games. Examining how digital games and 
digital game platforms might encapsulate the beneficial qualities of the physical gaming experience would be a 
valuable subject of future research. Stronger social features may help, and several attempts have been made to 
implement these for several consoles (such as Steam's Friends feature or Xbox One's Dashboard, which allow 
users to browse other people's collections or gameplay history) (Lee et al. 2016). 
Some gamers also want to sell their physical game copy after they've completed it, which they can't do with a 
digital copy. Borrowing games from friends is likewise not possible with a digital copy. When compared to 
clicking a link to download a game, giving a tangible copy to someone feels more authentic when you hand them 
a gift-wrapped game. 
 
3. Conclusions  
The case study looked at the current state of the gaming business and how it has evolved. The number of digital 
game copies sold in comparison to physical versions has been increasing in recent years, and COVID-19 has

amplified this trend. Gamers are unable to leave their house and are keener now to make their purchase at the 
safety of their own homes.  Sony reported an increase of seventy percent from digital sales last year (Harrison 
2020) 
In 2020, combining physical and digital sales resulted in a 34% rise in sales over 2019 (Dring 2021). Though 
digital sales have surpassed physical copies, the market for physical games is still lucrative and grew from last 
year. 18.2 million games were sold in 2020 which was an increase of 2% over 2019.  
Gamers' preferences vary; some favor the convenience of buying digital versions, while others enjoy the sense of 
ownership that comes with purchasing physical copies. Gamers who purchase physical copies desire the option 
of having the game in their hands and being able to decide what to do with it. When compared to digital, there is 
the possibility that a publisher will remove a copy of the game, and gamers who paid will lose access to it. Physical 
sales are even more pronounced when it comes to AAA games, games that are released by big gaming studios. It 
is estimated that 75% of games sold via Amazon, GAME, GameStop are physical copies (Dring 2021).

Abstract 
The domain name system (DNS) is a critical protocol in today’s Internet operation. It establishes a standard naming 
convention for human-readable, understandable, and memorable domain names and IP addresses of Internet services. 
The abundance of study on DNS in general and security and privacy suggests that all issues in this area have been 
resolved. The reality, however, is that despite the substantial amount of literature on different elements of DNS, there 
are still many unresolved issues. The researchers offered a standards-based security assessment using Cyber Security 
Evaluation Tool (CSET) to help the staffing agency understand and assess the many hazards associated with using 
the domain name system. Furthermore, the researchers investigate a range of potential countermeasures to such 
threats. 
Keywords 
DNS, IP Address, threats, security assessment, CSET 
1. Introduction
A program must be launched to discover vulnerabilities that hostile actors may exploit. Vulnerability is defined as the 
lack or weakness of a safeguard in an asset or resource. This lack or deficiency increases the potential for danger or 
assault to be more damaging or expensive, as well as more likely to occur (Newman, R.C. 2006). Deadly network 
security assaults may take the form of computer viruses, which can quickly propagate across networked systems. 
Viruses can damage data, destroy files, slow down system operations by spawning bogus processes, and prevent 
programs from storing information. 
 In this case study, the researchers performed a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment using CISA.gov Cyber 
Security Evaluation Tool. CSET can: 
•
Provide a consistent means of evaluating a control system network as part of a comprehensive cybersecurity
assessment
•
Specify cyber security recommendations
•
Report using standards-based information analysis
•
Provide a baseline cybersecurity posture
 IT Security Officers and IT Network Specialists are the type of participants to use this        evaluation tool to 
assess the organization/enterprise cybersecurity posture. The users may choose a maturity model based on the kind 
of organization/enterprise. A maturity model is a method for evaluating the effectiveness of an organization in 
achieving a specific goal. Additionally, it may assist an organization in identifying where its practices are lacking or 
ineffective and where they are deeply ingrained in the company. In cyber security, a maturity model is a tool that 
may be used to track the development of an organization’s security integration into its daily and strategic operations 
and the progress of similar businesses within an industry. 
1.1 Objective of the Study 
The approach was made by evaluating the current configuration digital infrastructure, with a cursory understanding 
of the network and operations of a Home Healthcare Staffing Agency. The researchers are not permitted to conduct

5. Conclusion & Recommendation 
The standards-based security evaluation demonstrates that a concentrated effort to solve the issues highlighted in this 
study may result in significant security improvements. Most of the issues highlighted need a sophisticated or high-
tech remedy and establishing security policies is strongly advised. Adhering to the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool’s 
findings as a guideline for improving cybersecurity is critical for achieving the intended security objective. 
For the Google Workspace, Domain Name System, and virtual machine of the case site company to remain secure, 
they must be reassessed regularly. At the very least, yearly, or promptly after a significant breach, is recommended. 
We conclude that the security of the. Staffing Agency case site in this study should be enhanced.  
Based on our findings, the researchers recommend the following: 
 
To help prevent spoofing and spam with SPF. A DNS record called an SPF TXT record verifies the domain name 
from which email messages are delivered, so assisting in the prevention of spoofing and phishing. SPF verifies the IP 
address of the sender against the purported owner of the transmitting domain to validate the origin of email 
communications (Microsoft 2022). 
 To increase security for an outgoing e-mail with DKIM. Set up DKIM to shield your domain from spoofing and stop 
spam filters from flagging your outgoing communications. The From address of an email message is forged in a sort 
of email assault known as spoofing. A communication that has been faked looks to come from the fake company or 
domain. DKIM can identify when a message has been altered and when the From: address has been changed without 
authorization (Google Workspace 2022). 
To increase security for forged spam with DMARC. DMARC, or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting 
& Conformance, is an email authentication mechanism that builds on SPF and DKIM, two further email 
authentication techniques, to determine whether an email message actually comes from the location it claims to have. 
In addition to email authentication, it also has reporting features, allowing domain owners to look at email 
authentication data for their own domains.  DMARC's primary goal is to stop phishing and email spoofing. In recent 
years, email phishing has been a significant security concern. According to research, about 50% of cyberattacks target 
small firms, and over 90% of network breaches begin with a phishing email. A security breach puts a lot of things at 
risk for a company, including damaged brand reputation, intellectual property theft, immediate cash loss, etc.(Dmarcly 
2022) 
 Set up Cloudflare Origin Certificate to server. Depending on the level of protection required and the amount of 
configuration you're prepared to do, Cloudflare SSL functions in various modes. Your website will always benefit 
from HTTPS because traffic to the end user will always be encrypted. However, there are many different ways to 
set up the traffic between Cloudflare and your origin server (Cloudflare 2022).

vibration levels. Composite materials have the advantage of having improved material qualities that are comparable to 
metallic alloys while being low in weight. This work primarily focuses on the design of various combinations of 
Carbon/Glass epoxy reinforced composite beams, as well as vibration control using various control techniques (Semi-
active and Active) of various combinations of hybrid composite sandwich beams with Magneto- Rheological fluid 
core, as well as the implementation of LQG, LQR, and PID controllers using ANSYS and MATLAB Simulink. It is 
designed with mainly two different combinations (Carbon Fibre - MR Fluid Core - Carbon Fibre, and (Glass Fibre - 
MR Fluid Core - Glass Fibre) and vibration response has been taken based on the literature studies that have been 
carried out on the Composites beams (Glass + Carbon reinforced in epoxy matrix composite separately). Composite 
sandwich beams with a magneto-rheological fluid core implanted between composite face plates have been created, 
and a semi-active and active vibration control study has been conducted. The study then moves on to designing a 
Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller, Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller, and Proportional Integral 
Derivative (PID) controller for Active vibration control of hybrid composite sandwich beams. These controls were 
used to minimize the settling time and vibrational peak amplitudes on the created composite sandwich beam. The 
percentage reduction in settling time as well as vibrational amplitude was discovered to be significant.

1. Introduction
For millennia, vibration control has been a debated subject. According to records, the Roman civilization investigated 
the natural frequencies of its bridges. Uncontrolled vibration produces a variety of severe damages to various 
engineering structures, which is why the concept of vibration reduction is given such weight. Unwanted vibration leads 
to structural problems and shorter lifespans, as well as a loss of accuracy in precision equipment and machine 
performance. As a result, vibrational control has gained prominence in the scientific community. Because knowledge 
of damping qualities was limited at the time, damping capabilities of a material were not considered a significant issue 
when choosing materials for engineering applications. Material science advanced during the Industrial Revolution, and 
several new materials were developed that not only have greater damping qualities, but also have more strength and 
toughness, and are better in certain ways than their popular predecessors-steel, iron, and aluminium. Fibre Reinforced 
Composites are one sort of material that fits this description.  
When compared to traditional structural metals, these composite materials have superior mechanical properties such 
as strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness-to-weight ratio. As a result, these materials are widely used in the aerospace 
and wind turbine blade sectors. Glass Epoxy Composite and Carbon Epoxy Composite are two examples of common

For CF-MRF-CF sandwich beam in forced vibration, on observing Figure 7 and Table 10, we can infer that the 
amplitude reduction is more in the casoe of LQR (55.36%) than PID (53.21%) controller and LQG (19.31). So, it is 
clearly evident that both the PID and LQR controllers are reducing the vibration significantly by noticeable degree and 
the settling time for the beam is lowest in case of LQR controller and the max amplitude is also very low in case of 
LQR controller. LQR controller offers a significantly huge amplitude reduction of 25.6% (free vibration) and 55.36% 
(forced vibration) as shown. 
5. Conclusion
In the case of composite beams having Magnetorheological Fluid Core, when it comes to the material having low 
stiffness, such as Glass Fibre, PID can be used to reduce the max amplitude, whereas LQG can be used to reduce the 
settling time. In the case of high stiff materials, such as Carbon fibre, again PID can be used to reduce the max 
amplitude, in the free vibration application, although for forced vibration, LQR performs better. When it comes to 
reducing the settling time, LQR performs the best. These are the important observations which can be seen to be 
potentially applied on the Aerospace and Automobile applications, the sports car, and aero plane wings in particular.

Abstract 
The fixed zone perturb and observe (FZPO) maximum power point tracking (MPPT) divides the photovoltaic (PV) 
curve with the boundary voltages into multiple zones at different irradiance levels. This MPPT demanding has low 
cost and simple controller as it is easy to implement without any additional sensors. FZPO improves the steady state 
efficiency of the system compared to conventional perturb and observe (P&O) technique. The zone boundaries are set 
based on linear equations that reduces the system’s complexity and also provides efficient tracking at varying 
irradiance conditions. Governments all over the world have been devoting enormous resources to improving air quality 
in order to combat the alarming problem of air pollution. So, a focus towards electrical vehicle (EV) is increasing and 
it is necessary to integrate renewable sources like PV systems to it. In this paper the analysis of EV system is performer 
with the PV system and it is compared with FZPO to conventional P&O MPPT. The PV system based on FZPO MPPT 
is shown fast transient performance at varying temperature and irradiance conditions from 300 to 1000 W/m2. The 
overall EV system performance is verified in the various aspects: - MATLAB/Simulink environment.

1. Introduction
Our earth has a lot of potential to give us energy for lifetime, the main problem for human being is how to utilize that 
energy. Human being has discovered many ways to extract the energy from different sources present on the earth like 
for sunlight we can use solar thermal and solar photovoltaic system, for wind we use wind turbines and for biomass we 
use different methods to convert biomass to energy. Sun has a lot of potential to give us energy. In this paper we will 
see the photovoltaic energy of the sun. To convert the solar energy, we use solar panels. The energy generated from the 
panels will stored into the batteries and some energy may be sent to the grid also. In solar panels semiconductor material 
junction are used to generate energy from excitation due to sunlight. Panels are designed to get maximum power from 
the sun. According to design the panels are divided mainly into categories, Monocrystalline and Polycrystalline. These 
materials are set in an arrangements by consideration the safety and efficiency issues.  
When exposed to daylight, photons are absorbed by electrons in the semi-conducting substance, that causes to become 
extremely charged. These migrate between the semiconducting material's top and bottom surfaces. A current termed as

6. Conclusion 
In this paper, a FZPO MPPT technique is used to overcome the limitation like: drift in tracking, response time and 
high steady state loss etc. at varying irradiance condition without any irradiance and temperature sensors. At different 
boundary voltages the PV curve used in FZPO technique are divided into multiple zones. The adaptive and fixed step 
size using simple linear equations are used to make the calculation more efficient. In compare to P&O technique the 
FZPO technique attains a drift free tracking. The controller parameter for FZPO technique are used only for design 
stage and it does not need any complex calculation during real time tracking. Hence the FZPO technique is performed 
better than the conventional P&O MPPT for standalone PV system.

1.Introduction 
Vibration control of structures has been an intense field of research since many years. The reason such importance is 
given to the field is because unwanted vibration causes structural failures and reduced lifetime, accuracy loss in 
precision equipment, and performance degradation in machines. Thus, vibrational control has been established as a 
significant field in the scientific world. Material science advanced during the industrial revolution, and several new 
materials were developed that not only have greater damping qualities, but also have more strength and toughness, 
and are better in certain ways than their popular predecessors-steel, iron, and aluminium. Fibre Reinforced Composites 
are one sort of material that fits this description. When compared to traditional structural metals, these composite 
materials have superior mechanical properties such as strength-to-weight ratio and stiffness-to-weight ratio. As a 
result, these materials are widely used in the aerospace and wind turbine blade sectors. Glass Epoxy Composite and 
Carbon Epoxy Composite are two examples of common fibre Reinforced Composites. 
 
The mathematical equations for the flexible beam is developed using modal theory and implemented the LQR control 
(Zhang et al. 2008). Experimental study is conducted on the cantilever beam using PID controller and validated with 
the simulation results obtained (Alam and Rahman 2012). Active control scheme is implemented on the passive 
constrained beam and find out the optimum parameters to get the maximum damping in the structure (Lam et al. 
1997). Integrated the active control methods into the finite element solutions in ANSYS. Both the numerical and 
experimental studies have done on the smart composite laminate structures under free and forced vibration conditons 
(Malgaca 2010). Active vibration control strategies for the vibration suppression in beam applications have been 
discussed, and effectiveness in implementing the controller numerically have been presented (Heganna and Joglekar 
2016; Rimašauskienė et al. 2019; Kusagur et al. 2020; Tian et al. 2020; Reddy et al. 2021) The bending deformation 
and failure criteria in the sandwich beams composed of aluminium foam core and metallic face layer materials by 
using FEM was presented in the paper (Sha et al. 2011).

For CF-VE-CF sandwich beam in forced vibration, we can infer from Figure 7 and Table 10, that PID controller offers 
a significantly huge reduction of amplitude 50.35% in forced and 52.36% in free vibration. LQG controller offers a 
significantly huge reduction of 27.24% in forced and 13.29% in free vibration. The settling time is lowest in case of 
LQG controller and the max amplitude is very low in case of PID controller. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In the case of composite beams having viscoelastic material core, when it comes to the material having high stiffness, 
such as Carbon Fibre, PID can be used to reduce the max amplitude, whereas LQG can be used to reduce the settling 
time. In the case of low stiff materials, such as Glass fibre, again PID can be used to reduce the max amplitude, 
although for reducing the settling time, LQR needs to be used. These are the important observations which can be 
seen to be potentially applied on the Aerospace and Automobile applications, the sports car, and aeroplane wings in 
particular.

Abstract 
In India, the number of deaths caused just by failing to treat a patient in an emergency situation in a timely manner is 
considerable. One of the key factors is India's emergency response system, which is out of date, in comparison to 
other technology. This study focuses on achieving operational excellence using block chain technology. The 
proposed concept focuses on real-time location monitoring of the ambulance, allocation of the nearest ambulance 
and hospital depending on the real-time location of the patient. Since there is a surge in demand for speedy medical 
emergency help, the study also focuses on maintaining a database of the patient's past medical records. However, 
these records shall be encrypted and accessible by the pertinent Doctors or Authorized Persons before the patient 
arrives at the hospital. The concept has essentially addressed all issues of safety and compliance. A descriptive 
analysis employing simulation techniques and secondary data from a literature review are used to support the 
proposed concept. After examining the contributions of all other entities, this research proposes a model that uses 
block chain to help in the reduction of time during crisis and the facilitation of healthcare infrastructure related to 
medical emergencies.

1. Introduction to Healthcare
For the sake of clarity, health and health care must be distinguished from one another. Health entails more than the 
absence of disease. Good health ensures disease-free living as well as the ability to fulfil one's full potential. As a 
result, health should be considered the inevitable foundation for assessing a person's sense of well-being. In every 
mature civilization, population health is a distinct important challenge in public policy discourse, usually 
determining the deployment of a big society. They include the country's cultural perceptions of disease and well-
being, the level of socioeconomic inequality, the accessibility of health services, and the quality and cost of care as 
well as an up-to-date biomedical understanding of health and disease. 
Not only does health care include medical treatment, but it also includes all aspects of preventative care. It also can't 
be limited to government-provided or paid-for care; it has to include incentives and disincentives for self-care and 
treatment paid for by private individuals to overcome disease. When private out-of-pocket spending dominates the 
cost of health-care financing, as it does in India, the consequences are bound to be regressive. At its most basic 
level, health care is often seen as a public good. As a result, demand and supply cannot be regulated only by the 
invisible hand of the market. It can't be established only on the basis of utility maximization.

Figure 9. Cause and effect analysis on different major challenges in medical emergencies operations. 
 
Figure 9, describe the various challenges that obstruct the entire operation process of medical emergencies, and how 
they can be reduced to a bare minimum by implementing the appropriate processes, reengineering the system, 
raising public awareness, improving technology, and redeveloping the current set of legal laws (Aringhieri et al. 
2017). 
 
6.  Limitations 
Various studies, including the health ministry's assessment of Emergency Management and Research Institute 
(EMRI), discovered the following shortcomings in India's existing Emergency Management Services (EMS): 
• 
Hospital infrastructure for treating and managing medical crises, particularly in public hospitals, has to be 
strengthened. 
• 
A lack of training and infrastructure for medical emergency management/first aid training for public and 
private sector health workers. 
• 
Existing government-owned ambulance fleets are unhappy with the new ERTS programs (in terms of 
operational links and fleet uniformity) and enforcement across states (Al-Shaqsi  2010). 
• 
The legal structure that defines and regulates the duties and responsibilities of various stakeholders (such as 
ambulance operators, emergency technicians, treating hospitals and personnel, and so on) requires more 
clarity, consistency, and enforcement across states. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Within a hospital, there are many more medical crisis occurrences than cardiac arrests, and many of these may go 
unnoticed and untreated. By providing immediate access to critical care personnel and equipment, a medical 
emergency response system can help avoid accident fatalities. India's medical infrastructure is severely deficient, 
resulting in innumerable deaths that may have been averted if the system had been improved with better technology, 
money, and less hardship. According to Cause and Effect analysis, we found that majorly six challenges are 
individually fragmented. These can be address as well as synchronize as per this model to validate with positive 
results and can reduce the mortality rate and various emergency response challenges. Objective criteria for 
diagnosing a crisis should be included in the medical emergency response system. We discovered an impediment to

medical emergency services as a result of our study and observations, and developed a model to facilitate healthcare 
infrastructure related to medical emergencies utilizing Block Chain Technology. 
Future Recommendations: 
Because the above study is simply a model, the actual implementation of QR codes and block chain may differ from 
the research, making the entire process difficult to execute. The project can be completed in stages, with the block 
chain being added afterwards. The goal of this research is to improve healthcare facilities, and implementing QR 
code authentication might be a time-consuming procedure. QR code authentication is being phased out in favor of 
newer methods.

Abstract 
Climate change is one of the major challenges faced by the world in the 21st century. The recent IPCC 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report highlights that even with the rapid decarburization, the existing 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have severe irreversible impacts on the climate. Therefore, negative emissions 
technologies like direct air capture (DAC), bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, afforestation and 
reforestation, etc. are expected to play an important role in climate change strategies. Researchers are working on 
scaling up the technologies to get significant benefits. However, the different direct air capture methodologies are 
energy-intensive. While researchers are working on identifying ways to improve process efficiency, this research is 
focused on identifying the areas of application where DAC is more effective. This study aims (i) to summarize the 
various popular DAC methodologies – solvent, solid sorbent, electro-swing, cryogenic, and humidity/moisture 
swing – based on the identified indicators, and (ii) to evaluate the DAC technology to identify the preferred sites in 
India for developing DAC facilities in the near and long term. All states and union territories of India are evaluated 
from the short- and long-term perspectives based on clean energy and sequestration capacity. The proposed 
framework will help the government agencies and private investors to take informed decisions on the preferred sites 
for developing DAC facilities.

1. Introduction
Global warming and climate change is one of the serious problems being faced by the earth right now. Greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHG) is increasing rapidly due to the industrial growth. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the major 
contributors to climate change. The concentration of CO2has rose from 280 parts per million (ppm) in the pre-
industrial period to 412 ppm in 2020 (Dlugokencky and Tans 2022).  The increased CO2 emission has contributed to 
the global temperature rise. According to scientists  at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, the average 
global temperature has risen by 1.1 °C since 1880 (World of Change: Global Temperatures 2022). The increased 
temperature is causing climate anomalies and adversely affecting the various species living on the planet. India 
alone accounts for 7.02% of total annual CO2 emissions of the world (Ritche et al. 2022). Globally, researchers are 
working on improving the current industrial processes to reduce emissions, developing newer technologies to reduce

6. Conclusions
Direct air capture is an important negative emissions technology having significant potential to combat climate 
change. DAC is getting a lot of attention from investors, who see a potential in the technology to complement the 
decarburization efforts being carried out throughout the globe. Different DAC methodologies can be used to remove 
CO2 from the atmosphere and each has its advantages and limitations. Solvent and solid sorbent based systems are 
currently the most mature methods. Companies are trying to scale up these processes and reduce the cost of capture. 
The study provides a brief comparison of the different DAC methodologies. Available literature pointed out that the 
energy source and the nearness to the sequestration capacity are two major factors that determine the efficiency of a 
DAC system. Based on these two factors a weighted factor method is developed in the study to evaluate all states

and union territories in India for this potential to set up DAC facilities. It was found that in the near term, Gujarat is 
most preferred when both factors have equal weightage and Himachal Pradesh is most preferred when clean energy 
is given a 75% weightage. But considering the geography of Himachal Pradesh which lies in the Himalayas, 
construction of a DAC facility might be challenging and thus Gujarat will be preferred. In the long term, 
Maharashtra and Rajasthan are the most preferred states for equal weightage scenarios and 75%-25% weightage 
scenarios, respectively. Both the locations have significant renewable energy potential and sequestration capacity 
which makes them suitable for the long term scenario. It is interesting to note that Gujarat is among the top five 
preferred states in the long term scenario for both cases, thus it is beneficial to establish a DAC facility in Gujarat as 
it has potential not only in the near term but also in the long term. The current study only uses two factors– clean 
energy and sequestration capacity– for the evaluation of DAC methodologies. In future, it will be interesting to 
develop more factors for the evaluation. Moreover, the future studies can be carried out to compare various DAC 
methodologies based on their maturity and viability. India also requires a more comprehensive survey of 
sequestration capacity. Currently most of the literature only provides an estimate of the sequestration capacity based 
on theoretical and empirical formulas. More research on DAC from an Indian perspective can help in increasing the 
awareness about the process, which can lead to more stakeholders considering DAC to include in India’s actions 
against climate change.

Abstract 
In recent years, neutrosophic sets has become a subject of great interest for many researchers and has been widely 
applied to multi attribute decision making (MADM) problems and the single valued trapezoidal neutrosophic 
number (SVTN) is used to deal with uncertain information.  In this paper, a new aggregation operator namely single 
valued trapezoidal neutrosophic ordered weighted harmonic averaging (SVTNOWHA) operator is proposed for 
solving MADM problems.  The combining ideas of the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal 
Situation (TOPSIS) and SVTNOWHA operator, which can be prove the accuracy of decision maker. A 
SVTNOWHA – TOPSIS approach for MADM problems with SVTN information is proposed. Finally, an example 
is provided to elaborate the proposed method. In the proposed SVTNOWHA - TOPSIS approach, the ratings of 
alternatives and attributes for illustrative problem are represented by the SVTN numbers. This study has developed 
the SVTNOWHA - TOPSIS method using the neutrosophic information in order to solve the investment company 
problem. In future, the proposed method may also be applied to solve other MADM problems such as enterprise 
selection, supplier selection, low carbon logistics service provider selection and investor selection.

Multi attribute decision making (MADM) is an important part of decision process.  In 1981, Hwang and Yoon 
developed the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Situation (TOPSIS) for solving multi criteria 
decision making (MCDM) problems. In 1965, Zadeh developed the theory of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic when 
applied to a various type of MCDM problems. Moataz and Aminah (2016) presented TOPSIS method based on 
prioritized aggregation operators to solve MCDM problems.  Muhammad and Fazal (2017) proposed fuzzy TOPSIS 
method for solving MCDM problems.  Jibin et al. (2018) presented TOPSIS and fuzzy preference relations based on 
hesitant fuzzy set for solving MADM problems. S. Zeng and Y. Xiao (2018) presented hesitant fuzzy MADM using 
TOPSIS and distance measures.  Gia Sirbiladze et al. (2019) developed hesitant Fuzzy TOPSIS method for solving 
Facility Location Selection Problem.   Desyta and Suharyanto (2019) presented Fuzzy TOPSIS method for 
determining priority of small dams construction.  Dhiraj Kumar and Sharifuddin Mondal (2019) presented fuzzy 
TOPSIS method for optimizing of forging problems.  Sindhu et al. (2019) developed TOPSIS method for solving 
decision making problems under picture fuzzy sets.  Aydemir and Gunduz (2020) presented fermatean fuzzy 
TOPSIS method with dombi aggregation operators for solving MCDM problems.  A. Fahmi et al. (2020) presented

are proposed.  The SVTNOWHA – TOPSIS method procedure has been explained and the proposed method 
extended for solving MADM problems with single valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers. Finally, an example is 
illustrated in a case study of Investment Company when choosing an investment plan. In the future study, we aim to

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to examine the ability of different statistical features obtained from denoised vibration 
signals to distinguish between healthy and defective Rolling Element Bearings (REB) at the six sigma significance 
level or Defects Per Million Observations (DPMO). Raw vibration signals from the experimental setup were 
subjected to Interval Dependent denoising. Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) technique was used to generate 17 
statistical features for 4 independent conditions of REB, viz., healthy(N), and REB with defects on Inner Race (IR), 
Outer Race (OR) and Ball (B).  These statistical features were compared using the Independent Samples test at a six 
sigma significance level. Five statistical features that could distinguish between a defective and a healthy REB viz, 
Root Mean Square (RMS), Standard Deviation (SD), Square of Mean of Square Root (SMSR), Mean Absolute 
Value (MAV) and Log-log Ratio (LLR) at six sigma significance were identified. The methodology used in this 
study is a unique combination of vibration signal analysis, statistical feature extraction and simple inferential 
analysis of REB defects at very low significance levels comparable with six sigma DPMO. The identified statistical 
features can be used before predictive analysis.

1. Introduction
The research on Rolling Element Bearings (REB) fault diagnosis is important as REB plays a vital role in rotating 
machines and their rotating state is directly related to the performance of the machines (Ni, Wang and Zeng, 2019). 
Time Frequency analysis (TFA) is widely used in REB fault diagnosis and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is 
one of the prominently used TFA technique. The computing techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN) 
and  support vector machines (SVM) are being used increasingly for REB fault diagnosis and the effectiveness of 
these methods is directly related to the quality of the features (Rai and Upadhyay, 2016). Raw vibration signal with 
unwanted noise leads to improper fault diagnosis and hence, the raw signal is denoised to attain effective fault 
diagnosis. Several statistical features using different signal processing techniques were extracted from denoised 
vibration signals by past researchers to diagnose and predict REB failures. Recent research by Hoang and Kang 
(2019) used deep learning algorithms based on convolution neural networks. The bearing fault classification is 
performed by using features without using any feature selection method yielded good results under a noisy 
environment.  However, another recent study (Niu et al., 2019) used Deep Belief Network and Principal Component 
Analysis (for feature reduction) for REB fault diagnosis. It may also be noted that approaches such as z scores and 
six sigma have been used in the past to improve fault detection accuracy (Mohanty, Sahu, and Mahapatro, 2018) 
In this study, vibration signals of a 6205 deep groove ball bearing were acquired independently for a healthy REB, 
and defective REBs like REB with defect on the ball, defect on IR and defect on OR were subjected to Interval 
764","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Mean and Peak were able to differentiate between a healthy and defective bearing satisfying the five sigma criteria 
of DPMO (233 defects per million). WNNL was able to differentiate between a healthy and defective bearing 
satisfying four sigma criteria of DPMO(6210 defects per million). All the statistical features except mean, skewness 
and WNLL were able to differentiate between a healthy and defective bearing satisfying 6 sigma criteria of DPMO, 
when defects were in OR. Mean, Peak NNLL and WNLL can also distinguish between a healthy and defective 
bearing satisfying 6 sigma criteria of DPMO, when defects were in IR.  
Thus, this paper presents a fresh approach/ methodology for feature extraction, selection combined with independent 
samples test, which can critically distinguish between defective and a healthy REB. It also identifies the statistical 
features that can distinguish between defective and a healthy REB and also confirm to six sigma standards of 
DPMO. Conversely, the chances of RMS, SD, SMSR, MAV and LLR erroneously distinguishing between a healthy 
and defective bearing is less than 3.4 per million occurrences.  
The above results implied that null- hypothesis H0 could not be rejected after the Independent Samples Test as it was 
not possible to reject all the sub null- hypotheses simultaneously. However, it was observed that null hypotheses 
corresponding to some statistical features could be rejected leading to the inferences drawn in this section. Figure 5 
also supports these inferences (tabulated in Table 4) as it clearly highlights specific Statistical features and the 
respective REB conditions with approximate DPMO below six sigma, five sigma and four sigma threshold values 
shown by the dashed horizontal lines. 
 
5. Discussions and Implications 
Many researchers in the past have studied the ability of different combinations of denoising, feature extraction and 
feature selection. Researchers have also evaluated the ability of extracted features to ascertain bearing health. This 
study presents a novel approach for comparing the vibration signals of a healthy and defective bearing using 
statistical features at higher significance levels or DPMO corresponding to six sigma standards. The study also 
highlights some important statistical features whose values can be referred for continual monitoring of REB health. 
Owing to the recent trend towards the prognosis rather than diagnosis of REB and the improved computing 
capabilities, researchers have preferred predictive analysis techniques such as SVD and Artificial Neural Networks 
(ANN) based on machine learning principles. Predictive analysis is generally preferred over inferential analysis of 
the feature data. However, predictive analysis necessitates high levels of data measurement and computational 
capabilities and the associated effort and costs. Hence, the diagnostic ability of a statistical feature to differentiate a 
healthy REB from defective REB at a higher significance level corresponding to six sigma standards, before 
prognostic analysis, could be useful. This could help in eliminating statistical features that are indifferent to REB 
health without using much computational efforts, as a statistical feature that cannot diagnose REB defects also 
cannot predict REB defects.In addition, continuous on line generation of big data, monitoringand prognostic analysis 
of the data may be necessary only for REB that are used as critical elements of assemblies/ machines causing 
potentially catastrophic effects. In other applications, continual alerts on REB replacement can be both cost effective 
and help managers and engineers make their preventive maintenance schedules more effective. Hence, the novel 
approach of this study is expected to help future researchers to focus on a few critical statistical features. It may also 
be noted that the inferences drawn in this study are specific to the combination of denoising scheme, signal analysis, 
and features extracted at a specified significance level.  Future researchers are suggested to apply predictive 
analytics techniques such as ANN and SVD only to those statistical features such as RMS that clear inferential 
analysis tests to reduce the computational effortsensuring higher levels of effectiveness in REB health monitoring 
efforts. 
 
6 Conclusions 
 
This study is intended to explore the ability of different statistical features to distinguish between a healthy REB and 
REB with defects on ball, IR and OR at higher significance levels corresponding to six sigma standards. Vibration 
signals were extracted from a customised bearing test rig. These signals were subjected to Interval dependent 
denoising, and statistical features were extracted using DWT technique. Using DWT method of signal processing 
seventeen statistical features were extracted from the signals. Three pairs of independent samples were formed based 
on the REB condition concerning 17 statistical features. Inferences were drawn about the ability of each statistical 
feature to distinguish between a healthy and defective REB, by application of the independent samples test. It was 
inferred those the five statistical features, viz., RMS, SD, SMSR, MAV and LLR could critically differentiate 
between a healthy REB and a defective REB irrespective of whether the defect is on ball, IR and OR. This study 
suggests that the inferential analysis of statistical features can help researchers to focus only on those statistical 
features that can differentiate between healthy and defective REB by eliminating those statistical features that do not

differentiate between healthy and defective REB. Inferences at a significance level corresponding to six sigma can 
make these inferences more acceptable.

Abstract 
Covid-19 crisis has made huge impact and caused grave economic challenges in countries around the world and 
especially on developing countries like India. Many sectors were affected both economically and emotionally. One 
such sector which had the possibility of being harmed was that of migrant labourers. The labourers were suddenly left 
jobless due to the pandemic. Most of them moved to their place of origin but some decided to stay at their place of 
work. Many news articles highlighting their hardships and struggles were published. Government and private 
organizations extended some aid towards their daily requirements during the pandemic. However, not a lot of research 
articles were published about their condition and how they fared during the time. Being an unorganized sector, the 
workers do not have job security. Even in the best of times, their income rates are low and savings, non-existent. This 
project attempts to identify the issues, which affected the migrant labourers during lockdown. Data was collected from 
63 migrant workers using a structured questionnaire. The respondents were workers who had migrated from places 
such as North Karnataka, Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to Bengaluru. Data was collected from 
different parts of North Bengaluru. During the survey, it was found that earning was the factor that majorly affected 
their state of living. This study and subsequent analysis showed that migrants were content with their increased wages 
and job assurances given by their employers.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of Covid-19 in December 2019, led to a pandemic which put the world under an unexpected crisis. This 
caused enormous number of deaths (Vyas 2020) and also led to scarcity of food, water and basic necessities to many 
sections of the population in India. Covid-19 crisis destroyed the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around 
the world, and it has also emerged as the most disruptive global crisis in recent memory. The unemployment rate in 
India in April 2020 turned out to be 23.5%. This was much higher than the 8.8% unemployment rate in March 2020 
and even higher than the 7.6% recorded in the fiscal year 2019–20 (Vyas 2020). With the enforcement of the lockdown, 
not only were many people left without jobs but some also had to face the hassle of moving back to their hometown.

security, mobility issues, privileges and earning have a significant variance on itself. Among these four variables 
privileges have the highest variance followed by earning, mobility issues and job security respectively. Since 
livelihood has a dotted line, the variance is non-significant. Mobility issues and earning have significant covariance 
between them. The effect of the significance is 0.266. The rest of the latent variables have dotted lines, which indicates 
that they are non-significant. The measured variable regarding job guarantee is non-significant but it an effect of 20.03. 
Similarly, in mobility issues the measured variable regarding monetary benefits has significance and also size of the 
effect is high i.e. 3.359. The rest of the measured variables job guarantee, monetary benefits and quality of stay are 
non-significant.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
During lockdown we witnessed many migrant workers walked miles to reach the place where they belonged, being 
unemployed, no shelter and with financial insecurity. After the literature review, we considered five such factors which 
created major impact on their living during Covid for analysis. But there are many other factors that affected these 
migrants which can also be considered. Because of the time constraints the responses were collected only from North 
Bengaluru, which also limited the sample size for the analysis.  
From our analysis we found that majority of the migrants were farmers and agriculture workers in their villages. The 
main reason for their migration was lack of rural infrastructure. A fundamental change is required by the Government 
which will reduce the distress migration of these skilled agricultural labourers.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The Covid-19 outbreak, has disturbed millions of lives around the world. Similarly, it has affected a lot on the lives 
of the people who live in India. Many of the labourers who travel to different parts of the country had faced lot of 
issues. Some of these issues include getting back to their hometown, getting support to fulfil their necessities and so 
on. Our focus was to analyze the difficulties faced by them. This was possible by conducting a scheduled survey, 
which consisted of questions regarding the five major factors namely Livelihood, Earning, Privileges, Mobility Issues 
and Job Security. The qualities such as measure of central tendency, measure of variability was analyzed by 
performing Descriptive Statistics for the PC’s. The effect of age, occupation and gender on the factors was found out 
by conducting independent sample T-test. We have also built a Structural Equation model using JMP to build a 
relationship between latent variables and measured variables. 
 
From the analysis, it is found that earning has a significant effect on livelihood of migrant labourers. We can also say 
that earning has an impact on mobility issues, most of the mobility issues were concerned with the monetary benefits

given by the contractors/supervisors. The quality of stay was also a major factor for deciding the privileges given to 
the labourers. The job guarantee given by the bosses became the major factor for job security of the migrant labours.

Abstract 
Simulation is becoming a need for the industries nowadays as the businesses are required to take critical decisions 
frequently. Simulation has various applications in many areas. The current research focuses on simulating the 
warehouse situation. A simulation model of the warehouse is built by using Witness 2021 simulation software. The 
model is also validated by comparing it to a real-life situation. After running the model for a certain time, the statistics 
have been collected for the model. This will help to understand the existing situation for the warehouse. Then the 
efforts are made to reduce the queues. For that what-if- scenarios are generated. Based on these scenarios, the 
experiments have been conducted in the Witness experimenter. The results for these experiments are then analyzed 
and the best results with alternative solutions are provided.

1. Introduction
The fourth industrial revolution brought the modern technology into the manufacturing. It integrates various modern 
technologies which include internet of things, cloud technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning into 
manufacturing. Industry 4.0 represents a new industrial stage of the manufacturing systems by integrating a set of 
emerging and convergent technologies that add value to the whole product lifecycle (Dalenogare et al. 2018). 
Industry 4.0 has nine technological pillars one of these pillars which are internet of things, augmented reality, 
simulation, additive manufacturing, system integration, cloud computing, autonomous systems, cybersecurity and big 
data analysis. 
Simulation is one of the most important pillars of the industry 4.0 as it is the only one pillar which deals with the 
future analysis of the process. Simulation can reduce the cycle times and it can lead to less failures in the start-up 
phase of production (Simons et al. 2017).Schuhet al. (2014) mentioned that it will be easy and efficient to take 
decisions and the quality of decisions can be significantly improved by easy and quickly with simulations. 
Simulation gives a single point solution to the digital manufacturing. This is because of the multi utility nature of the 
simulation software which not only allow users to develop the model but also let them experiment with them and 
validate (Mourtziset al. 2014). 
This study deals with the process of simulation by using the DES simulation tool Witness 24 developed by the Lanner 
group based in UK. Witness is a process modelling and simulation software. Currently witness is used in many 
industries within different sectors. Witness allows users to build the digital model of the business which can be 
simulated for any period, and it helps users to analyze the model by generating various reports in the witness. 
Witness is very useful for solving real-life problems. In this paper, similar application of Witness in reducing the 
queue lengths is carried out.

Like Figure 4, Figure 5 represents the combinations of different cycle times and the outcome of the average number 
of parts in the queues.  
 
 
 
Figure 5. Results after Experiment 2 
 
From the above graph, it can be observed that, even the reduction of 1 min of cycle time of loading machine results 
into no queue after the packing machine. 
 
6. Conclusion 
There are so many advantages of using simulation over doing the calculations manually or with the help of spreadsheet. 
If we consider it financially the cost of making the prototype of the system and experimenting through it will become 
rigorous and costly. Whereas the software will provide the exact details. 
During this study, simulation has helped in the process of building the model also the experimenter feature of it has 
helped to optimize and analyse the processes which are being conducted inside the warehouse. 
The reports which Witness provided has given us the capacity of our existing system and its utilization. Also, Witness 
provided the statistics report after adding the processing machines. 
Witness also provided the visual interpretation of the processes in a single model which might not be possible as the 
machines and workstations are huge which helped in the external communication. Witness’ visual interface also 
helped to communicate effectively with the people working at any level with ease irrespective of their knowledge 
about the witness software. 
The dynamic chart inside the model helps to get the report at any specific time also it helps to get the day when the 
highest number of items were in the queue. 
In the optimization process witness has helped to get the scenarios which were possible to analyse also it helped to 
understand the effect of various parameters on the length of queues. From which it can be understood that the machine 
number are the most important criteria to reduce queue, the cycle times can help to reduce queues significantly, but 
the parameters and number of carriers don’t help much in reducing the length of the queue. 
Finally, this model helps in making critical decisions considering the factors which affect the system. So, it can also 
be used as a decision-making tool.

Abstract 
Technology is rapidly evolving, and the internet is now essential in most people's daily needs. The increased use of 
cyberspace and data creation has increased cybercriminal activities. In the Philippines, the internet has been 
exceedingly used by the youth in finding data and gaining general knowledge, and Filipinos have also been found to 
be susceptible to cyberattacks. In order to maintain data privacy, Republic Act No. 10173, otherwise known as the 
Data Privacy Act, was implemented to keep up with the fast development of technology that became a hindrance in 
educating people, which may put national security at risk. The risk of data breaches and leaks have always been a 
concern in the Philippines, and this risk heightens with the prevalence of the pandemic. Contact tracing has become 
an essential to the government during the pandemic, and it is used to protect the data privacy of the Filipinos. However, 
it was put at stake after the ECOP proposed the suspension of the data privacy act by disclosing the names of infected 
people in hopes of close contacts to turn themselves in. It was concluded that cybercrimes have already been prevalent 
even before the pandemic. To help solve this issue, it is recommended that contact tracing must ensure that data 
privacy is always upheld. People who are assigned in handling and sorting data should be aware of the DPA and what

Abstract 
To achieve minimal carbon emissions and zero NOx emissions of a diesel combustion engine, a numerical study on 
novelistic Oxy-Fuel Combustion (OFC) technique (nitrogen free combustion) is carried out.  Diesel engine chemical 
reactions mechanism indicates that the presence of nitrogen during combustion generates NOx emissions, so a nitrogen 
free oxidizer environment i.e. oxy-fuel combustion is investigated, analyzed and compared with the conventional air 
combustion engine. A 4-stroke water cooled Kirloskar type engine with Conventional Air Combustion (CAC) is 
experimentally tested at various load conditions, with data acquisition done on cylinder pressure, indicated brake 
power (IBP), indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and emissions. The experimental data is used to correlate and 
validate the 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation setup with CAC and the validated CFD model is 
used to study the OFC impact on in-cylinder flow, engine performance and emissions. The results indicates that NOx 
emissions are completely eliminated in OFC and carbon emissions are significantly reduced. Contrastingly an average 
drop of 45% in IBP, IMEP of OFC is noticed at all the operating conditions, which can be attributed to lean, early 
start of combustion and shorter combustion rates in OFC. Water injection technique is adopted to overcome the loss 
in engine performance with OFC, although a relative average improvement of 32% in engine performance is observed 
in OFC with water injection, the overall engine performance is still 10% lower compared to the conventional air 
combustion.

1. Introduction
Oxy-Fuel combustion is an unconventional combustion technology proposed by researchers to reduce the exhaust 
emissions (Huang et al. 2018). OFC is a nitrogen free combustion technique achieved by replacing the air by pure 
oxygen as an oxidizer for combustion. Absence of nitrogen in combustion eliminates the harmful NOx emissions and 
the exhaust contains only carbon emissions and water vapor. Equation 1 and 2 represents the combustion chemistry 
of CAC and OFC.

6. Conclusion  
This research is about an investigative study on converting a conventional combustion diesel engine into an OFC to 
evaluate the variation in in-cylinder parameters, engine performance and emissions at various engine load conditions. 
Below are the significant conclusions of this research  
• 
The start of combustion in CAC is occurring at 358CAD, whereas in OFC it is at 345CAD signifying an 
early combustion and resulting a relatively lower peak pressure and temperature. 
• 
The effect of increased oxygen volume during in combustion is inducing a very high effective thermal 
conductivity of the working fluid in OFC, thereby increasing the heat transfer loss through the cylinder walls 
and resulting a 45% reduction in IP, IMEP. 
• 
In OFC, NOx is completely eliminated and a remarkable reduction in CO emissions and unburnt hydrocarbon 
emissions are observed.  
• 
The loss in engine performance with OFC can be recovered by water injection technique. Water injection is 
controlling the early start of combustion, rate of combustion and wall heat transfer losses, yielding a relative 
average improvement of 32% at all the engine loading conditions with unchanged emissions. 
• 
Though the overall engine performance in OFC with water injection is still 10% lower compared to CAC, 
the loss in performance is well compensated by the reduced carbon emissions and zero NOx emissions.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on improving the flow efficiency of a production line using simulation software. The aim of this 
study is to simulate the actual flow using advanced simulation software and improvement in productivity was done 
by increasing the utilization of the underutilized facilities. Simulation modeling was used to evaluate the equipment 
and manpower performance for the manufacturing system. Each individual facility in the flow has to be analyzed 
carefully and allocated to stations in a balanced way over the available workstations. The paper is divided into 3 
parts, the first part consists of data collection and distribution selection in which selection of best data distribution 
was carried out, the second part is about simulation modeling, analysis of the simulated model in which 
underutilized facilities were identified, and cause of the underutilization was identified, in the third part, the results 
of the model were analyzed, validated and finally, best modifications for the flow were suggested to improve the 
efficiency of the flow. And finally, Cost-benefit Analysis was performed to determine the tenure of recovering the 
total investment. Based on the simulation results, the top under-utilized facility was M5, M6, M7, M9, and M3 and 
the existing production was struggling to meet the customer demand due to machine shortages. So, to overcome this 
underutilization problem, we suggested some modifications by generating different scenarios in the flowline 
described in the proposed improvement section.

1. Introduction
An unbalanced production line is one of the biggest and most common problems facing manufacturing industries 
today. In most manufacturing companies, only 50-60% of time is spent on production, the rest is wasted due to lots 
of unplanned downtime. Production losses not only affect the efficiency of flowline, but also affect the growth costs 
of the production system, finished product quality, worker safety, work environment and worker satisfaction (Padhi 
et al., 2013). In manufacturing due to lack of availability of advanced simulation software’s and relying on 
conventional methods for analysis of efficiency of the manufacturing facility had always led to wrong decision 
making. For a smooth production flow and the most efficient use of manpower and equipment a balanced 
manufacturing is the answer.  
The digital manufacturing problem is solved through simulation in a single step. This is due to the simulation 
software's multifunctionality, which allows users to experiment with and test their models as well as create them.

is as shown in Figure 6. The simulated statistical result after modification is as shown in Table 5. The statistical 
results shows that how the facility utilization was improved by adding additional facility parallel to facility M1, M2, 
and M8. 
 
5. Cost Analysis 
Currently the company works on margin of around 10% of the total cost. The cost price of Component 1 single part 
is about INR 1,544/-, and Component 2 is around INR 1,800/- and the sales price is about 1,716/- Rs and 2,000/- Rs 
as shown in Table 6.So, by producing a greater number of components a total profit of 12,440/- per day is achieved 
by the company, and annually if we calculate it is about₹ 35,47,094.40 as the number of working days yearly are 
274 days. For improving the flow efficiency, the company must make investment on 3 new facilities which are dual 
axis turning CNC. Each facility costs around ₹ 1,13,33,116. So, the total investment costs around ₹ 3,39,99,348 have 
to be done by the company to improve its flow efficiency (Table 7).

6. Conclusion 
After the final analysis of simulated model, it was possible to detect the inefficiency of workplaces by simulated 
model results. In particular, it was possible to identify how much each workplace contributed to total inefficiency. 
Since the aim of this study is to improve the throughput and efficiency of the system through reducing the idle time 
and improving the material flow, In the first simulated model result it was observed that the M5, M9 is the main 
reason to the inefficiency of the flow. This is due to the high M4 process timing per part, the M5 machine remains 
idle until a batch of 24 parts come from M4 process to the buffer. So, to overcome this inefficiency of M5 process 
the first option is to combine the M5 process and M4 process so that there will be no buffer waiting for M5 
operation for a long time or the next alternate solution is that we can simply utilize the M5 facilities forM5 other 
components which are in the queue for M5from other production flows. And for improving the effective utilization 
of M9 and M3 generation of multiple scenarios were carried out and obtained optimum solution was determined via 
adding additional facilities or CNC. Finally Cost Benefit Analysis was performed, and a period of 9.97 years was 
estimated for the recovery of total investment that the company has made.

Abstract 
Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the extra copy of 21st chromosome in human beings. People affected 
by Down syndrome have different anthropometric traits compared to rest of the population. They are shorter in 
height, have broader neck circumference, larger hip breadth and short hands. Many of the people affected with 
Down syndrome have desk jobs which require continuous sitting in the chair for a long period of time and causes 
musculoskeletal disorders among them. The office chair used currently is designed based on normal population. 
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) maybe due to mismatch of their body anthropometry with normal chair. An 
ergonomic chair for people with Down syndrome was designed by considering their body anthropometric 
characteristics. The body measures of people with Down syndrome are collected and compared with the rest of the 
population. For designing the chair, 5th, 50th and 95th percentile of the anthropometric data was considered.  It is 
found that people with Down syndrome needs chair with lower seat height, larger seat width and larger backrest 
width. The specific design of chair for people with Down syndrome will reduce their MSDs to a greater extent.

1. Introduction
Down syndrome is a medical condition when the individual possesses an extra chromosome. Chromosomal disorder 
is due to cell division error (Temporal et al. 2017). According to a survey conducted by Centre for Disease Control 
and Prevention in 2021, 1 in 700 babies are affected with Down syndrome. The number of individuals with Down 
syndrome has increased in the 21st century (Krasniqi et al. 2022). People affected by Down syndrome have different 
body anthropometric traits while compared to rest of the normal population (Hassan et al. 2021). Studies conducted 
in the United States reveals that these people are employed in various fields like desk jobs, data entry, hospitality etc 
(Kumin and Schoenbrodt 2016). The quality of life these people should be increased as no cure can be done 
completely for this medical condition. Proper facilities should be provided to improve quality of work life providing 
ergonomic facilities. As most of the people prefer desk jobs, they use office chairs. They are engaged in jobs which 
need less physical effort. The office chairs in which they work now are designed based on anthropometry of the 
normal population. It may be difficult for them to use these chairs for long working hours as they have different 
body anthropometry. Anthropometry is the method in which human body dimensions are taken and studied. It is 
widely used in the field of ergonomics, automobile design, industrial engineering, clothing apparels design etc. 
Anthropometry is used in order to understand the body dimensions, design products etc (Dianat et al.2016). Using 
chair which have mismatch with ones body anthropometry can cause MSDs. The dimensions of chair like seat 
height, seat depth, seat width etc. are designed based on anthropometry. The dimensions of chair depends upon ones 
standing height, shoulder height, sitting height etc. (Santamaría et al. 2018). Usually for designing a workstation, 
anthropometric dimensions of people using the workstations are collected and designing is done based on suitable 
percentile (Kibria and Rafiquzzaman 2019). In the present study a anthropometric chair is designed for people with 
Down syndrome. 
The conventional office chair that has been used by people affected with Down syndrome are designed based on the 
anthropometry of the normal population. Most of the people affected with Down syndrome are generally shorter in 
height. As height is an important parameter for designing a chair the existing design can cause discomfort for them. 
Similarly each parameter of chair is designed using suitable percentile of normal population. It is difficult for people

Seat width = 1.15*Biacromial Breadth 
Seat width= 48.86cm 
By BIFMA Guidelines seat width must not be less than 45.78cm. 
 
5.3 Seat Depth 
Seat Depth is measured based on the shortest height. 5th percentile of buttock-popliteal length is used for design. 
Excess seat depth can lead to comfortless. Seat depth here is 33cm. According to BIFMA Guideline it should not be 
deeper than 42.3cm 
 
5.4 Backrest Width 
50th percentile of hip breadth is considered for designing backrest width. Here the backrest width is 41.41 cm. 
According to BIFMA Guidelines backrest width must not be less than 36.06cm. 
 
5.5 Armrest 
Armrest are connected to seat surface. While designing chair for people with Down syndrome we must design 
armrest -in such a way to accommodate their shorter and broader hand. Pivoted Arm rest can be provided 
 
5.6 Discussion 
High prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders were found in users when products are not designed considering 
anthropometric characteristics. Users reported pain body parts including neck, shoulder, arms etc. (Kibria and 
Rafiquzzaman 2019, Taifa et.al 2016,Ansari et.al ).Present study utilizes this concept. Designing chair based on 
anthropometry of people with Down syndrome can reduce the MSDs to greater extent. Barboza et.al (2018) found 
that the dominant shape among females affected with Down syndrome were oval. Other shapes found were 
hourglass, triangle, bottom hourglass, spoon, diamond etc.Among oval body shape bust size is higher than that of 
abdomen size. Waist circumference is higher compared to normality. In the present study female body of oval shape 
is considered to do the chair design. The 95th percentile of  heightin Portugal region among normal population was 
found to be 167.4cm(Barroso et.al 2005).  The 95th percentile value of  people with Down syndrome was found to be 
150cm. This value itself indicates the difference between normal group and subject group. Ansari et.al (2018) 
designed chair with adjustable armrest so that users can adjust height of elbow level to avoid the pressure.Designing 
workstation based on principle of adjustability accommodates wide range of users. This can also reduce the risk 
musculoskeletal disorder (Taifa etal. 2016).A height adjusting knob is provided in chair so that users can use them 
comfortably. Kibria and Rafiquzzaman designed chair for teachers in university considering their body 
anthropometry. They used 95th percentile of female hip breadth to design the chair’s seat width. In this study also we 
considered the 95th percentile of female to design the seat width. The work stations are generally designed using 5th 
percentile and 95th percentile value considering suitability and to accommodate large number of users (Kushwaha et 
al. 2016). The chair’s seat height was designed based on the 5th percentile value of popliteal height and seat width 
based on 95th percentile of female hip breadth to accommodate large number of users. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Ergonomic fundamentals were considered to design the workstation and provide comfort. The 5th , 50th and 95th 
percentile were used to calculate the suitable results. Suitable allowances were also provided. By designing the 
workstation following guidelines user’s discomfort can be reduced which enhances their performance and 
productivity. While designing the workstation, safety guidelines should also be considered. The designing should 
follow the design for adjustability principle. The anthropometric dimensions play a vital role in the designing of a 
workstation. By using the collected data from different participants and based on the posture and nature of work the 
designing of workstation is done. When a workstation is designed based on anthropometric traits the MSDs were 
reduced to  greater extent.The body anthropometry of people with  Down syndrome are very different compared to 
the normal population. They are shorter in length compared to the normal population which make their seat height 
and seat depth shorter in length compared to existing chairs. Hip breadth and waist circumference are larger for them 
when compared to the normal population which results in increased dimension of seat width compared to existing 
design. Most office furniture are designed based on BIFMA Guidelines were not suitable for the subject group use 
for a long period of time. While calculating seat parameters it is evident that most of the dimensions calculated have 
high variation from the conventional design of chair.  Since more people of the controlled group are getting educated 
and prefer to go to a job for a daily living we should design workstations comfortable to them considering their 
anthropometric traits.

The limitation of this research work is that the anthropometric characters collected are from secondary sources. All 
the calculations and comparisons were done for population in Portugal Region. Further research can be done by 
collecting the anthropometric traits of Indian population. Variations among subject group and normal group can be 
found and a new chair for Indian population can be done.

Abstract 
The aviation sector is highly competitive and customer-focused. Because of its client-centric nature, the industry's 
profitability depends upon customer satisfaction. The entry of more companies into the aviation industry has 
increased competition and the necessity to maintain service quality. Prior studies have identified seat comfort and 
cleanliness as the most important elements in determining customer satisfaction among airline passengers. The goal 
of this study is to identify factors that influence customer satisfaction among loyal customers and disloyal 
customers. Seat comfort, departure/arrival convenience, food and drink, inflight wifi service, inflight entertainment, 
online support, ease of online booking, onboard services, leg-room services, baggage handling, cleanliness are taken 
into account as the factors influencing customer satisfaction. Probit regression is used to find out the influence of 
various factors on customer satisfaction. After conducting the study, it was discovered that the impact of factors on 
customer satisfaction varies depending on whether the client is loyal or disloyal. Seat comfort, departure/arrival 
convenience, food and drink, inflight wifi service, inflight entertainment, online support, ease of online booking, 
onboard services, leg-room services, and baggage handling all have an impact on customer satisfaction in loyal 
customers, with inflight entertainment having the greatest impact. Seat comfort, departure/arrival convenience, ease 
of online booking, onboard services, legroom services, baggage handling and cleanliness all influence customer 
satisfaction among disloyal customers, with seat comfort having the greatest impact.

1. Introduction
Customer satisfaction is given top priority in the aviation industry, which is a highly competitive industry. The 
aviation industry could be described as customer-centric. New companies in this sector are being forced to provide 
more satisfying experiences and services to their customers as a result of their growth and development. Because of 
its customer-centric nature, the industry's profitability is dependent on satisfying customers and meeting their needs 
(Gures et al. 2014). There are two types of customers in the aviation industry: loyal customers and disloyal 
customers. Customers who are loyal to a company are more likely to use the company's services again over 
competitors. This devotion to the company stems from their previous positive experiences with it. Customers who 
are dissatisfied with a company's service are more likely to actively seek out better alternatives. This could be due to 
a previous negative experience with the company or a negative attitude toward the brand (Rowley and Dawes 2000). 
Brand loyalty of customers depends upon customer satisfaction and service quality provided by the company 
(Hussain 2016). Companies should cultivate their loyal customer base while also attempting to please disloyal 
customers in order to change their attitudes towards the company. As a result, it's critical to investigate the factors 
that influence customer satisfaction in both loyal and disloyal customers. The goal of this study is to discover 
important factors that influence customer satisfaction in both loyal and disloyal customers. Ranking these factors in 
order of their impact on customer satisfaction will give us an idea of which factors should be considered in order to 
cater to both loyal and disloyal customers. A dataset containing a total of 129880 observations from the Kaggle 
website was used for this study. Customers are asked to record whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with the 
services provided after the journey. They are asked to rate 11 factors that are found to affect satisfaction on a 5-point 
likert scale, with 0 being the lowest and 5 being the highest score. These factors include seat comfort, 
departure/arrival convenience, food and drink, inflight wifi service, inflight entertainment, online support, ease of 
online booking, onboard services, leg-room services, baggage handling, and cleanliness.

Following the removal of ‘food and drinks’, ‘online support’, ‘inflight entertainment’ and ‘inflight wifi service’ 
changes in the coefficients of other independent variables were observed as shown in Table 6.

This change in regression coefficient is observed because of the correlation that the deleted variables have with other 
independent variables. Highest change in regression coefficient is observed in ‘Ease of online booking’. This is 
because ‘inflight wifi service’ and ‘online support’ variables have high correlation (0.507 and 0.569 respectively) 
with ‘Ease of online booking’ compared to other independent variables. 
 
4.5 Important Factors 
The contribution of each factor in predicting satisfaction is represented by the regression coefficient. The greater the 
regression coefficient, the greater the impact that independent variable has in determining customer satisfaction. 
Five most important factors affecting customer satisfaction in Loyal customers and Disloyal customers are listed in 
Table 7 based on their regression coefficient.

‘Inflight entertainment’ which is insignificant in the case of disloyal customers is found to be a significant factor in 
determining customer satisfaction in the case of loyal customers. Onboard services and Legroom services were 
found to be significant in determining satisfaction in both types of customers. This is in accordance with earlier 
studies which pointed out that customer satisfaction is linked to service quality provided by the airlines company 
(Walia et al. 2021). Similar studies conducted in other parts of the world also concluded that service quality has a 
significant positive impact on determining customer satisfaction in the airline industry (Hussain 2016). 
 
5. Conclusion 
Customers who are loyal and disloyal have different combinations of factors that influence customer satisfaction. 
Seat comfort, departure/arrival convenience, food and drink, inflight wifi service, inflight entertainment, online 
support, ease of online booking, onboard services, leg-room services, and baggage handling are all factors that have 
an impact on loyal customers' satisfaction. Seat comfort, departure/arrival convenience, ease of online booking, 
onboard services, leg-room services, baggage handling, and cleanliness are all found to have an impact on the 
satisfaction of disloyal customers. In order to satisfy both loyal and disloyal customers, airline companies should

focus more on in-flight entertainment and seat comfort factors. Factors such as on board services and leg room 
services should also be considered because they have been found to influence customer satisfaction in both types of 
customers. Present study is based on the data collected from the customers of a particular airline company. In future 
studies the impact of various factors on customer satisfaction based on demography could be considered.

Abstract 
 
The concept of “Agile” originated nearly three decades ago from the software development and project management 
disciplines and existing presently in diverse forms and levels is an intriguing research arena that has wider scope and 
implications. Agile as a method has germinated into various forms such as scrum, kanban, scaled agile framework 
(SAFe), large-scale scrum (LeSS), spotify model, continuous integration, scaled agile lean development (SCALeD), 
and many more. Agile initially adopted in an isolated software development and team level, has over the years 
progressed into projects and programs, and furthered into solutions and portfolios, and achieved full-service expansion 
into an enterprise level framework. It has been proposed in this article to undertake a novel approach to survey the 
literatures of agile methods, models, and practices from software development and modeling to large-scale case study 
organization levels in a less explored banking and financial services sectors. Outcome of this study highlights the 
causal factors, best practices, benefits along with learnings that practitioners of banking and financial services sectors 
could adopt and envision a streamlined agile implementation.

1. Introduction  
Agile is the buzzword of 21st century that has its roots in software development domain (Gerster et al., 2019) has 
invariably caught the attention of practicioners from diverse industries and practices. The term “agility” is referred as 
a real-time software development method that engages in simultaneously creating and learning from client induced 
changes and adding value to client engagements through continual components development (Mikalsen et al., 2018).  
Agile methodology has been restructured into various models based on features, types and velocity such as scrum, 
scaled agile framework (SAFe), kanban, spotify model, and so on.  PMI defines “project management as a specific 
management action that contributes to the execution of a process and that might employ one or more techniques and 
tools” (PMI, 2008, p. 433).  Agile project management is defined as “an approach having a set of principles with the 
objective of delivering the project management in a much more flexible and iterative manner to reap benefits of highly 
innovative and valued products for customer with exemplary performance in terms of schedule, budget and quality” 
(Conforto et al., 2014). Agile method got introduced as a siloed software development methodology has over the years 
progressed into projects, cross-functional solutions, portfolios, and as an enterprise level guiding framework.  
Banks are highly regulated and complex institutions that has diverse functions and social responsibilities. Banking 
functions characteristics are well-structured, traditional approach and the services necessitates inculcating high levels 
of trust, whereas agile methods perform iterative updates and continuous releases. A working agile framework (Figure 
1) from one of the leading financial institutions has been presented in a logical architecture based on the real experience 
of the author of this study from the information technology industry during 2018.

5. Conclusions  
This paper evaluates in a systematic and detailed approach the earlier studies on agile methods, models, and practices 
from software development, modeling to large-scale case study organization level in a feeble explored banking and 
financial services sectors. Findings and analysis of this study highlights that there are multiple challenges, causal 
factors, remedies, best practices, success attributes that practitioners of banking and financial services sectors need to 
envision when they plan to adopt agile implementation.  Due to the traditional banking values and approaches, there 
are challenges and impediments in the agile transformation in this sector. Practicioners have to strike a balance in 
adhering to regulatory complications as well as educating and servicing the customer to create trustworthy and long-
lasting relationships when adopting the agile methods, models and practices. The thematic summary of agile 
implementations using state-of-the-art methods at multiple levels primarily for Banking and Financial Services 
domains consisting of remedial measures and success attributes (presented in section 4 and its sub-sections) could 
provide some valuable cues for practitioners to guide with mitigative measures and key success factors towards agile 
adoption. Literature evidences suggest future research avenues in terms of applying cutting-edge hybrid agile 
techniques, categorizing IT Governance mechanisms and widening the scope of agile adoption to other industries.

Abstract 
This paper presents an in-depth review of the studies around the Green Procurement and the Sustainability 
Performance of the Small and Medium Enterprises in India and at the global level. It aims at understanding and 
establishing the gaps within existing knowledge.  Micro, Small and Medium-sized enterprises accounts for more 
than 90% of all businesses and around 70% of jobs worldwide. 27th June, which is celebrated as the Micro, 
Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day, highlights the importance of these organisations in achieving the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by 2030. Sustainability being a buzz word across the globe, majority of 
the countries have outlined a plan for the future towards achievement of Sustainability in businesses. The study 
involved outlining the global practices and achievements in Green Procurement and Sustainability Performance 
of SMEs. The studies found that most of them focused on Green Supply Chain and little attention was paid to 
Green Procurement. Many studies on Green Procurement and its impact are conducted in the global West. Some 
studies in Indian context have addressed Sustainable Procurement, however they have paid little attention to 
establish the correlation with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of Sustainability. Very few Indian studies and fewer 
studies in Pune region, highlights the importance of study in this area. The present paper will provide more 
insights for understanding the Sustainability issues of the SMEs in India and at a global level, and how Green 
Procurement can be one of the solutions.

1. Introduction
India has traversed a long journey post-independence by starting as a newly independent poor underdeveloped 
nation in the year 1947. There existed a policy of self-reliance that was driven by ideology during 1950s-1960s 
strategy (Ray, 2006). A diversified industrial production strategy was planned ranging from simple consumer 
items to capital goods and heavy machinery. Trade was neglected, especially the exports (Wolf, 1982). Post 
1991, after the introduction of the Liberalization, Privatization and the Globalization (LPG) Policy, the Indian 
economy witnessed a paradigm shift and larger growth. Several sectors like IT, ITES, Biotechnology and 
Pharmaceuticals spurted out with several industries (Unctad, n.d.). Later in the year 2006, the Micro, Small and 
Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act was notified to deal with the policy issues affecting the 
MSMEs. Since they are regarded as the engines of growth, several advisory and consultative mechanisms were 
established. Since the MSME sector plays a crucial role in contributing to India’s economy. It is considered as 
one of the emerging and a dynamic sector that can contribute towards the Self-Reliance (“Aatmanirbhar”) of the 
country (Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, 2020).  The MSMEs has a new definition from 
July’2020 as - 
1. A Micro enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed one
crore rupees and turnover does not exceed five crore rupees. 
2. A Small enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed ten
crore rupees and turnover does not exceed fifty crore rupees 
3. A Medium enterprise, where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed fifty
crore rupees and turnover does not exceed two hundred and fifty crore rupees (Ministry of Micro, Small & 
Medium Enterprises, 2020). 
The Brundtland Report that was introduced by the World Commission on Environment and Development 
in 1978 is credited with familiarizing the term ""sustainability"" internationally (WECD). According to the study, 
sustainable development is meeting present needs without sacrificing the ability to satisfy those of coming 
generations. If just economic interests are taken into consideration, the environment and overall welfare would 
suffer. The Triple Bottom Line's three pillars—economic, environmental, and social concerns—must thus be

Abstract 
Construction is crucial to a country's overall economic growth, particularly in developing countries, in the current 
era of globalization. If construction operations are not carried out strictly according to a local or national building 
code, they might result in large-scale failures endangering human lives, personnel property, and the economic 
balance. It is vital to handle the construction process's risk elements. The self-weight of soil and surcharge loading 
behind the retaining line is the driving force and the shear strength of soil is the resisting force as a result, deep 
excavations invariably cause lateral and vertical ground deformations. As a result of the produced ground 
deformations, nearby structures and services become kinetically loaded. Risks associated with ground movement 
cannot be calculated solely using mathematical predicting models and engineering simulations as it needs to address 
the uncertainty of soil properties, Geo-materials, ground constitutive nature, building stage modeling, three-
dimensional impacts of deep excavations, time-dependent natures of ground deformations, and the critical necessity 
to include human variables such as craftsmanship into prediction models are all important considerations. This 
article presents a review of the most effective methods for evaluating hazards related to deep excavation and current 
mitigating techniques. Theoretical approaches to enhancing the safety of deep foundation excavation are examined 
in the context of a hospital building in Khartoum state and a residential district project in southern Jianxi province.

1. Introduction
The use of below-ground space in the development of congested urban areas for various reasons, such as 
transportation tunnels, is becoming increasingly popular across the country. Parking garages, basements, and utilities 
are all underground. Many plans to use the underground were highlighted by El-Nahhas. Deep vertical excavations 
and subterranean tunnels are required for such ambitious projects, which are frequently near existing structurally 
susceptible buildings and utilities (Nahhas, 2006). The amount and direction of the generated deformations are 
dependent on the building's closeness to the excavations, as shown graphically in Figure 1. Ground movement 
prediction and management around these construction pits are critical during the planning and construction phases of 
these excavations to protect the surrounding structures from current and future activities as the project progress 
(Nahhas, 2006). 
The advancement of science and technology in the construction sector, as well as the emergence of multiple fast-
growing economies throughout the world, has resulted in a decrease in the time necessary to finish a project and an 
increase in the quality of construction. The foundation of a building project is critical for determining the structure's 
stability. Extensive foundations, which are frequently used in commercial structures, need extensive excavations

A geotechnical survey was performed before the design which showed that the subsoil mainly consists of dense to 
very dense silty to clayey sand. The groundwater table was measured at 12 meters. Perched water was discovered at 
a depth of 6 meters during borehole digging. Rafts and piles were recommended for foundations (Gue et al., 2004). 
Excavation should be carried out to a depth of 8 meters, as planned. Before beginning any excavation, the contractor 
chose to install a shoring system consisting of 50 cm bored, cast in situ piles with an 8-meter length beginning at a 
depth of 5 meters. The reinforced piles 8m in length were cast in bored holes 13m in length. The consultant and 
contractor confidently installed shoring piles all around the perimeter with varying gaps ranging from less than 1 
meter in some places, as shown in Figure 3. This was due to an undefined well-shoring item and a lack of attention 
to the groundwater table and dense soil layers (Gue et al., 2004). 
 
The excavation for the basement was started and as the construction gradually progressed and the depth of the 
excavation reached 6m the perched water started flowing into the pit from all directions. The water collected started 
corroding the top dense layer of soil and cavities were formed behind the piles. To collect the running water, the 
contractor chose to dig trenches in front of the piles all around the perimeter and begin dewatering (20 hours/day 
pumps). The sand layer at 6 m deep was crushed by piling concrete, resulting in necks at that level. 11 piles on the 
east side of the plot had been sheared due to the allocation of necks inside the permissible line for retaining walls. 
The collapse had led to the fall of 1m long supporting soil. Lack of attention to the report from the geotechnical 
survey, the casting of shoring piles without appropriate control, and irregular gaps between them are the causes 
outlined for this failure (Gue et al., 2004). 
 
4.2 Residential Project in Jianxi 
The project building has 32 floors and 2 basement levels. The building is located in a residential district of southern 
Jianxi province in a suburban area. On the south side of the excavation, there are many resettlement houses and 
sewer pipelines. The perimeter of the pit is 180m and the bottom of the pit is 12m below the water table. The 
existence of relocation houses and pipelines is to hold accountable for the complex nature of the project and the 
increased rate of occurrence of accidents. Soil retaining systems discussed above are to ensure the safety of 
buildings around the foundation pit and for slope stability. It is been observed that safety accidents often occur 
during the construction of these retaining wall systems affecting the construction pace and loss of personnel 
property. The materials available in the suburban region are not enough and the initial design of the support 
mechanism is heavily dependent on the experience of the professional. Any minor flaw in the support design safety 
accidents of a relatively larger magnitude. An administrative penalty was imposed due to the disturbance caused by 
the accumulation of mud on public road surfaces during the construction of the diaphragm wall (Gaoxiang, 2018). A 
survey conducted on the people involved in the construction process revealed that the majority of the workers 
believe luck to be a major factor in determining the safety of the pit. The failure of construction schemes and safety 
measures as well as the personnel's lack of safety awareness are the main sources of accidents. To scale back or even 
eliminate the occurrence of safety accidents, it is necessary for every construction technician to strictly follow the 
building code, and development plan and take safety measures in each step to achieve a safe environment 
(Gaoxiang, 2018). 
 
Because of the uniqueness and complexity of the surrounding environment and the project, as well as the high cost 
of steel sheet pile support and the soil's poor adaptation, the diaphragm wall support and row pile support with 
anchors were chosen for the project as they are least susceptible to the hydrological aspects and underground 
structures around the site. The Supporting techniques of deep foundation pits are varied in different sites and it 
produces different consequences. If we would like to offer full play to all or any of the functions of deep foundation 
pit support technology, we should always take the initiative to offer full play to the benefits of support technology, 
and judge the characteristics of the project intimately consistent with the development requirements and therefore 
the characteristics of the building itself, then choose the supporting method which is suitable for it. The analysis of 
the encompassing environment and therefore the hydro-geological condition should be taken because the key points 
within the analysis of the characteristics of the project, and therefore the support mode of the deep foundation pit 
should be adapted to the surrounding environment and hydrogeological condition (Xiaoyan, 2018), (Ou et al., 1993). 
 
3. Conclusion 
Even for shallow excavations, appropriate temporary earth-retaining structures should be constructed to protect the 
sidewalls of the excavation. The design should take into account the impacts of severe weather as well as the 
presence of existing foundations of structures Extra precautions should be taken when working close to an existing

building and resettlement houses. Risk Management is a crucial stage in a project, having cost efficiency and safety 
of the environment as its primary objectives. To limit the damage of deep excavation works to nearby buildings, a 
building evaluation is an important aspect of the risk management process. The technique is given in Technical 
Reference 26: 2010 – Technical Reference for Deep Excavation (Singapore Standard 2010) provides designers with 
a good reference on how to conduct building assessments. 
The supporting technology adapted in the construction of a deep foundation pit should be such that it avoids long-
term effects on the environment or destabilizing existing structures around the excavation. It is vital to study and 
build the monitoring and management mechanism from all perspectives, paying special attention to the management 
of dust pollution and noise pollution in the surrounding environment, to protect people from the negative effects of 
production and life. To study the structural behavior of retaining walls due to soil-structure interaction and also 
monitor the structural health of structures near the excavation, a comprehensive study was presented. From the 
results obtained it can be stated that bracing or reinforcement mechanisms are necessary to provide constraint or 
limit the wall movement and deflections. An anchor retaining bracing mechanism is recommended to keep the effect 
of excavation on nearby structures to a minimum.

Abstract 
The Rotary Evaporator is used for systematically removal of solvents from samples by using evaporation 
procedure in chemical laboratories. The working principle of rotary evaporator is that the boiling point of liquids 
lowers on decreasing their pressure which allows the solvent to vaporize at lower temperatures than when boiled 
in a normal atmosphere. Molecular cooking for the preparation of distillates and extracts can also be done by this 
device. After thoroughly studying the device and its functions we have designed the parts of rotary evaporator 
and assembled using SOLIDWORKS software. In this we have taken vapour duct, rotary mechanism assembly 
and bench for static analysis using SOLIDWORKS. The maximum static stress and static strain, minimum static 
stress and static strain of vapour duct, rotary mechanism assembly and bench are analyzed. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
A rotating evaporator is a laboratory instrument for evaporating solvents from samples in an efficient and gentle 
manner. Rotary evaporators are used to extract chemical substances which are further used for other chemical 
purposes by professors in chemical and biochemical labs.In the industrial field, rotary evaporators are used to 
extract cannabidiol (cbd), the major component of marijuana, which is then utilized to make medicine in the 
pharmaceutical field. Rotovap's fundamental premise is to enhance the rate of evaporation of the solvent by 
lowering the pressure to lower the boiling point of the solvent, rotating the sample to increase the effective 
surface area, and heating the solution. Mainly the rotovap manufactured in the foreign countries uses cast iron, 
aluminum and other metals. The rotavaps bodies are made by casting method which increases the material usage 
and cost. In order to reduce the raw material usage and manufacturing cost the modeling of the body is done 
with Sheetmetal. This reduces the raw material usage, cost and makes the body can be easily manufacturable 
and serviceable. This device is currently manufactured in China, by some German OEMs. The cost of the device 
supplied by these OEMs is huge, with the current world scenario, the manufacturing and import of goods from 
China has been severely affected, which has resulted in great demand for the device and its spares in the Indian 
market. This has pushed up the cost of the device exponentially, making both cost and time unaffordable for a 
lot of Indian laboratories. After thoroughly studying the device and its functions, we are trying to develop a low 
cost, completely Make in India rotary evaporator by modeling and analyzing important components of rotovap. 
1.1 Objectives 
•
To fabricate the device at low cost compared to existing rotary evaporators.
•
To increase the serviceability of rotary evaporator.
•
To increase the ability to withstand loads.
•
To reduce the weight of device compared to present rotary evaporators by fabricating with sheet metals.

6. Conclusion 
The design and analysis on the structure of the rotary evaporator is developed successfully and it indicates that 
the design of the rotary evaporator created has good enclosures provided for the equipment for preventing the 
unexpected spillage of the chemicals and breakage of the glassware. Material for the parts of the rotary 
evaporator is selected on the basis so that it can with stand their actions from strong acid and alkaline 
substances. Static Analysis is done in SOLIDWORKS simulation on the parts of the rotary evaporator where 
they experience loads and forces. Torque is applied on the vapor duct and Loads are applied on rotary 
mechanism and bench by considering factor of safety. The simulation results unambiguously shows that the 
parts designed are effective and give better performance under working conditions. Hence, this design comes 
with easy manufacturability and increased serviceability compared to the imported equipment accompanying 
good aesthetics with full safety conditions.

Abstract 
Seaport inefficiencies have caused barriers to maritime operations especially operational disruption which ultimately 
adds to high-cost expenses, redundant waste, environmental pollution, and financial losses. As a result, operations, 
economical and environmental sustainability cannot be attained which will impact the complete maritime supply 
chain-related aspects. Therefore, a lean, agile, resilience, and green (LARG) performance model is proposed as a 
method to control these issues and improve the competitiveness and efficiency of seaports in the Indian marine 
context. LARG criteria in the seaport supply chain have been identified and analyzed using extensive literature 
reviews and expert assessments based on the Indian seaport supply chain perspective. This paper aims to identify 
and select the relative importance of each LARG performance model on basis of operational. economical. and 
environmental related performance of seaport supply chain using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique 
by forty-three experts from various maritime domain experts in India. The research results indicate that operational 
performance has the highest contribution to seaport supply chain performance in Indian seaports followed by 
economical performance and environmental performance. This research study can also assist on related dimensions 
in seaport performance to enhance trade capabilities, operational efficiencies, and competitive advantages of the 
seaports in the maritime supply chain area. Furthermore, this LARG management tool can be applied in the global 
maritime context considering adaptability aspects.

An efficient maritime supply chain management requires synchronized development in customer service level 
satisfaction and maritime internal and external operation system efficiency. Maritime organizations also need to gain 
and possess values and advantages to be eminent from their competitors in the domain on delivery services, 
financial services or in aspects of industrial support (Christopher et al. 2016). The advancement of LARG (lean,

The finding of this research study involves incorporation about modelling LARG related concepts performance in 
maritime operations and seaport supply chain activities of Indian context and result of this paper can be utilized to 
support seaports to be competitive among their customers and seaport related stakeholders to ensure the operational 
sustainability aspects of the seaports and also includes support towards economic growth. This research paper guides 
to innovative scope towards maritime and seaport domain research to establish the dependency of LARG (lean, 
agile, resilience and green) key dimensions based on its concepts and to investigate the applicability of the proposed 
model by assessing the LARG performance in the maritime operations and seaports supply chain. To evaluate the 
LARG performance in the seaport supply chain and maritime operations several seaports across the geographical 
locations and cargo position-wise can be chosen as test cases for the research. 
This research study will also support maritime domain experts and seaport practitioners, decision makers to 
comprehensively develop a holistic substantial management concept to boost the seaport performance in efficiency 
and effectiveness aspects. This research study can further also support associated maritime and related seaport 
entities with stakeholders towards enhancing of the trade capabilities, operational efficiencies and competitive 
improvements of seaports supply chain and maritime operational activities.

Abstract 
In a rapidly changing world where technology is constantly evolving. The ultimate goal of any supply chain is to 
achieve end-to-end transparency by means of analysis of real time data. With the onset of the pandemic several supply 
chains have crippled. The inception of an intelligent supply chain can open doors to create a transformation in the 
existing supply chain management system into one that is independent and self-conditioning. Various tools such as 
Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, sensors, etc. can be used for the digitalization of the supply 
chain. In the Indian Manufacturing industry, while multinational companies are aggressively working towards 
digitalizing their supply chains, the MSME sector is reluctant to undergo this transformation. The possible reasons for 
this might be the lack of information and research available which truly understands the benefits reaped by companies 
which have digitalized their supply chains in this sector. The focus of this research is to conduct an exploratory study 
on the impact of digitalization on the manufacturing industry. The study is based on data collected from a survey, 
which upon analysis using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling reveals that digitalization 
has a positive and direct influence on visibility and performance. Inculcation of digitalization improved transparency 
between the supplier, retailer and distributor. It also highly positively impacts the planning operations for MSME 
companies in the Indian manufacturing sector. Some of the most beneficial aspects were the performance of the order

1. Introduction
In a world that is rapidly evolving and changing, the impact of technological innovations is constantly felt. Digital 
technologies have advanced faster than any other innovation owing to a majority of the world's population having 
increased access, and in just two decades resulting in significant changes to basic processes across a wide range of 
businesses. 
According to a McKinsey report, Digital applications could improve almost every sector of India's economy. 
Information technology and business process management, digital communication services, and electronics 
manufacturing hold the capability to double their GDP to $355 billion to $435 billion by 2025. New digital ecosystems 
are already forming in agriculture, healthcare, retail, logistics, and other industries, redefining consumer-producer 
interactions (N. Kaka et al.2019).   
India plans to raise the contribution of the manufacturing industry to the GDP from 15 % to 25% (S Mathur 2019). 
To accomplish so, a network of tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 suppliers with high levels of quality, flexibility, and efficiency

Since the indirect effect of digitalization on visibility (𝛽𝛽=0.565) is greater than the direct effect of digitalization on 
visibility (𝛽𝛽=0.515), a mediation effect does exist. Digitalization has a positive and direct influence on visibility and 
performance. Visibility has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between digitalization and performance.  
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
Further divisions can be created to better understand the impact of digitalization on MSMEs. 
• These divisions could be made on the basis of the geographical breakup of MSMEs to understand the impact of 
digitalization on the MSMEs in various states 
• It could be done by going one level higher and dividing the country into north India, south India, east India and west 
India. 
• Categorization can also be done to understand the impact of specific technologies on this sector such as the impact 
of just cloud computing/big data/sensors/additive manufacturing to name a few. 
• Division could further be made to understand closely the impact of digitalization on a specific sector which lies 
under the umbrella that is the manufacturing industry such as, just the electronic parts manufacturing industry, or just 
the textile industry. 
• The work would take a different path depending on the sections chosen to understand the impact and the various 
factors identified. 
• The implications of changing control variables could also be absorbed and tested further. 
 
5.4 Validation  
In order to validate the hypothesis Test-retest reliability, Cronbach Alpha, Kurtosis and Skewness and Hypothesis 
Test - Model Fit was conducted. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The aim of the project was to understand the benefits reaped by digitalization in the MSME companies which have 
upgraded their supply chains. There was a targeted focus of investigating the direct effects of digitalization on the 
performance and chain visibility, and the mediating effect of visibility on the relationship between digitalization and 
performance. 
 
Our research revealed that digitalization has a positive and direct influence on visibility and performance. The study 
also identified visibility as a significant mediating variable, with partial mediation. It was further found that the up 
gradation to a digitalized supply chain reaped benefits in several factors. Some of the most beneficial aspects were the

inculcation of digitalization improved transparency between the Supplier, Retailer and Distributor. It also highly 
positively impacts the Planning operations. 
Hence deeming the up gradation to a digital supply chain highly fruitful and beneficial for MSME companies in the 
Indian manufacturing sector.

Abstract 
Solar air heaters are renewable, active heating devices that use an absorber plate, a collector and an air blower to 
heat a space under consideration. They are meant to aid the existing heating devices and not replace it. In 
conventional solar air heaters, there is absorption of solar radiation by the black absorber plate and used to heat the 
air beneath it which is made to flow using a blower and heat is used to warm the space. In this study, the 
conventional solar air heater is modified with the help solar water heating system with a reflector which aids in extra 
heat gain by the absorber plate of Solar air heater which in turn heats the air to a higher temperature. Study was 
conducted over a three-day period between 10:00 to 18:00 hours and average meteorological and input values were 
taken. There was 48% increase in amount of heat gain by the solar air heater while the increased in efficiency of the 
solar air heater is nearly one and a half times than the conventional solar air heater which was the aim of the study. 
This modified solar air heaters could be useful in industrial as well as domestic applications as it is more efficient.

1. Introduction
The world's total annual energy consumption is approximately 5.67 x 1020 J. If we compare the amount of solar 
energy accessible on Earth 5 x 1020 J per hour, demonstrating that solar energy can provide the world's energy needs 
without harming the environment(Van De Graaf, 2014). Electricity is now produced by extracting energy from fossil 
like crude oil, natural gas and coal. Global civilization must break free from the shackles of fossil fuels, and a 
commitment must be made to switch to renewable and environmentally friendly sustainable resources and phase out 
fossil fuels. Furthermore, conventional energy resources are scarce. As a result, the world's energy demand must be 
met via alternative energy sources(Shukla & Modi, 2017). To save our future, we must also plan to take 
revolutionary step to shift toward cheap solar energy based sources(Silveira, 2003). 
Solar air heater collect heat from sunlight and use it to heat air(Solar Air Heating Systems, n.d.).A solar air heater 
catches solar energy in the form of thermal energy and can be used as a thermal collector due to its simple design, 
low construction cost, and easy maintenance. The kind, dimensions, and design of the absorber plate, the insulating 
materials, and the quantity of glass covers all influence the solar air heater's effectiveness (Hassan & Abo-Elfadl, 
2018). Due tothe less heat transfer rate to air from the absorbing surface and the considerable heat loss into the 
surroundings, solar air heaters function poorly (Alam & Kim, 2017). The usage of expanded surfaces can increase 
the rate of heat transmission(Daliran & Ajabshirchi, 2018; Mohammadi & Sabzpooshani, 2013), artificial roughness 
applied to absorbent surfaces,(Behura et al., 2017; Kabeel et al., 2017; Sahu & Prasad, 2017) etc. There are also 
several strategies for reducing solar air heater losses. Multi-pass flow, selective coating on the absorber plate, porous 
media, and other techniques are among them.

Figure 10 demonstrates the hourly variation in efficiency of both conventional and modified SAH. The 
Experimental efficiency of conventional and MSAH was 18.2% and 27.6% respectively. The daily average 
efficiency of modified SAH was 51 percent higher than conventional one. There are higher losses in conventional 
and modified SAH if the efficiency is low. Explanation for inferior performance of conventional SAH was due to 
lower efficiency and higher irreversibility that happened in it(Bayrak et al., 2013). 
Figure 11. Variation in efficiency of conventional and modified SAH 
5.6 Proposed Improvements  
In the current experimental investigation, the enhancement in SAH is done with the coupling of SWHS (solar water 
heating system) and the use of reflectors with the constant mass flow of water in SWHS and constant mass flow of 
air in SAH’s. There are also many issues which can be investigated for further research. Recommended issues 
studied are as follow: 
The flow rate variation of liquid and air in SWHS and SAH’s can be done and can optimize the best value for the 
highest output gain. 
Double pass SAH can be used instead of single pass SAH and investigate the same experiment also analyze the 
output result for both the cases. 
6. Conclusions
The thermal performance of modified SAH and conventional SAH has been evaluated. The augmentation in this 
experiment was of reflectors. The reflector was faced on SWHS for three consecutive days. The comparisons are 
done in conventional and modified SAH and found that modified SAH is beneficial than conventional SAH. 
The following are the main findings for modified solar air heater compared to conventional SAH: 
•
The modified SAH obtained 7.54 % higher output air temperature than the conventional SAH.
•
The daily average heat gain absorbed by the air in modified SAH was 48%greater than conventional SAH.
•
The efficiency of the conventional and MSAH was 18 percent and 27 percent respectively.

Abstract 
In the Globalization era, pollution from old vehicles is increasing faster. This may lead to changing the vehicle or to 
curtail vehicle pollution, which may result in the scrapping of old vehicles. To complement and supplement 
Government of India passed Vehicle Scrappage Policy in FY2021, a pilot study was conducted to know the public 
awareness of Vehicle Scrappage Policy. An effective policy related to vehicle scrapping cannot be successfully 
implemented unless large number of people supports policies on Government intervention. This paper aims to 
explore the public comprehension and acceptability about Vehicle Scrappage Policy after creating awareness in 
Bengaluru, India. In this study, methods adopted are Pilot study through market survey, statistical analysis and 
encompasses relevant literature review. After the survey, people have awareness about the Policy but unsure of 
fringe benefits one can attain from Government.Therefore, creating awareness and advertisement on the Vehicle 
Scrappage Programs along with benefits both economically and environmentally to the Country are warranted.

1. Introduction
The pollution from the vehicle exhaust is one of the main sources for pollution of air. According to CSTEP the 
pollution causing in Bengaluru may go up to 74% by 2030 (The Hindu, 2022). Old vehicles have further promoted 
air pollution in the total vehicular pollution by polluting 10-25 times more than that of newer vehicles (IBEF,2022). 
For this reason, Government has taken initiative to scrap old vehicles by discouraging people from using old 
vehicles. To control the pollution from older vehicle, Government follows a principle that the ‘polluter must pay’. 
Thus, the Government has planned to levy green tax for such old vehicles and issued guidelines to states / UTs. 
Green tax is implemented on the vehicles which pass fitness & emission test after 15 years of registration of 
vehicles. According to Government of India, the green tax is valid only for 5 years and the Owners are eligible for 
scrapping their vehicles as well. The implemented green tax shall be around 50% of the road tax which also depends 
on the State / UT Governments. If public is not interested in renewing their Registration Certificate with such 
percentage of taxes, the Owners can offer their vehicle for scrapping to the registered scrappers. It is better to scrap 
the vehicle, as it reduces the pollution. Moreover, the Vehicle Owner obtains repayment from the authorized 
scrappers along with concession in road tax on buying new vehicles in parallel (MoRTH, 2022). 
In order to offset environmental impact, environmentalists had three options that is to introduce electric vehicles; 
introduce strict rules on emission by bringing (BS6) engines and introduce vehicle scrappage policy paving way for 
circular production. In particular, an electric car has substantially lower operating costs than a comparable fuel or 
diesel vehicle. Electric vehicles charge their batteries with electricity rather than utilising fossil fuels such as

Figure 6 reports knowledge on acceptance of policy by customer segmentation. It shows that majority of students 
and salaried have decided to resell rather than to abandon their four-wheeler. On the other hand, Self-employed have 
chosen to scrap vehicle rather than reselling it.  
 
 
 
Figure 6. Customer Segmentation about Acceptance of Policy 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
The data clearly indicates that, out of 126 responses only 67.50 % respondents own vehicle. Majority of respondents 
were not having knowledge about the Vehicle Scrappage Policy. Market survey made people to get insight about the 
awareness. As a result, 81.20 % accepted that scrapping old vehicles will reduce environmental pollution. But 50.60 
% believed that Scrapping Vehicle is an effective way of replacing old vehicle and 49.40 % opted for resale. 
From the study, it can be concluded that even though people appreciate the policy, the respondents are still unsure 
because the policy is new and people are not satisfied with the benefits announced by the Government. Further, the 
respondents are keen to observe the acceptance of policy in near future, until then people shall choose reselling their 
car instead of scrapping. This shows that the Government has to create awareness, advertise and stress the vehicle 
scrappage programs to leverage the benefits from the policy considering environment. 
From our market survey, people received awareness about the Vehicle Scrapping Policy and now they are expecting 
more from the Government. Instead of 25% rebate on the road tax, the Government should increase the tax rebate 
since; an individual will pay more than 25% in terms of taxes ranging from GST to road tax, cess, and toll gates 
etc. Strict laws on emission of vehicles should be imposed so that people will scrap their old vehicle to hinder tax. 
The automobile industry should use best-in-class technologies for scrapping old vehicles, where it can increase the 
availability of good raw materials which can be recycled and used for future propose. Government should advertise 
more about the scrapping areas to make aware for public.

Abstract
Slot management systems such as the Truck Appointment System (TAS) play a crucial role in the functioning of the 
logistic terminals such as loading and unloading facilities by managing the timing of truck arrivals. But truck arrivals 
are unpredictable due to the uncertain nature of road traffic. Both early and late truck arrivals increase truck waiting 
times and create congestion around the loading facilities, which is undesirable. Due to the emergence of Industry 4.0 
technologies, real-time truck arrival information can be shared to manage slot adjustments better as late arrivals reduce 
slot utilization and affect slot availability for future bookings. This study is focused on a loading facility facing 
uncertain truck arrivals and proposes mathematical models for optimal rescheduling of slots in the presence of truck 
arrivals information. The integer mathematical model developed for optimal rescheduling minimizes the truck waiting 
times by explicitly capturing the complexity of loading operations at a petrochemical facility. We integrated the 
rescheduling model into a discrete-event simulation model to compare the performance of the proposed approach with 
the current scenario to estimate the expected benefits at higher congestion and demand levels. The results show that 
the truck waiting time reduces by more than 50% at higher congestion levels.

A Decomposition Based Algorithm to Minimize the One 
Machine Weighted Tardiness Problem

Abstract 
The one machine weighted tardiness problem has been studied extensively by researchers over the last few decades. 
It is a problem that is simple to state, but not easy to solve. It is a problem of sequencing a set of independent jobs on 
a single machine with the objective of minimizing total weighted tardiness. In view of its NP-hard nature, a 
decomposition-based heuristic is proposed and computationally compared with some well-known heuristics available 
in literature. The proposed heuristic consists of two phases. In the first phase, certain dominance conditions for a 
selective forward neighborhood swap are developed and applied. The second phase consists of a local improvement 
procedure using a single pass insertion technique to further improve the schedule. The simplicity of the algorithm 
enables manual solutions to small problems. Several problem-sets with different schedules and three measures of 
performance are used in this comparison. Initial results are promising and indicate that the proposed heuristic is the 
best for all measures of performance.

Abstract 
This study aims to understand the effects of variable nose cone geometry on the performance of a ramjet engine. The 
performance of a Ramjet engine is primarily measured by its critical factors, namely, the pressure recovery ratio and 
velocity variations. Specifically, the combustion performance and overall efficiency of a ramjet engine depend on the 
pressure recovery ratio. Design modifications are carried out by using the formulae from the literature and simulations 
are carried out initially to validate the results from the literature for the specified nose cone angle. Further, the nose 
cone angle is varied from 6° to 20° with increments of 2°, and its impact on the overall performance and efficiency of 
the Ramjet engine is analyzed. Variations of pressure recovery ratio along the cowl and ramp surface of the engine 
are plotted along with their contours to determine the most favorable nose cone angle. Considering the optimal nose 
cone angle, the concavities are also varied along the ramp of the engine’s inlet for a range of 2 mm with increments 
of around 0.5mm in between them. The best pressure recovery ratio which benefits the working of the engine is 
understood. Graphs are plotted to compare the various results obtained between the pressure recovery ratio along the 
cowl and ramp surface for varying angles and concavities. The best pressure recovery attained concurs with literature 
for a nose cone angle of 11° while its combination with the concavity of 4.318 mm gives the optimum performance.

1. Introduction
Ramjet engine is an air-breathing jet engine that uses the forward motion of the engine to compress the incoming air 
for combustion. Ramjet engines have the best efficiency at supersonic speed of Mach 3 and are limited to a maximum 
speed of Mach 6 due to the shockwave-induced pressure loss that occurs due to the slowing of intake air to subsonic 
speeds. The first part of a ramjet is its diffuser (compressor) in which the forward motion of the ramjet is used to raise 
the pressure of its working fluid (air) as required for the combustion of fuel. It is then passed through a nozzle to 
accelerate it to supersonic speeds. This acceleration gives the ramjet a forward thrust. Ramjets cannot produce thrusts 
at zero speed. Hence, they require an assisted take-off to gain speed until it begins to produce thrust. Inlet cones are a 
crucial component of Ramjets in raising the pressure inside the engine body, which would eventually produce the 
thrust. The main purpose of the inlet cone is to slow the flow of air from supersonic flight speed to subsonic speed 
before entering the engine. 
The length of the nose cone assembly and pressure recovery ratio are dependent on nose cone angles. Varying the 
nose cone angle can result in large number of shockwaves being produced within the body. The optimal nose cone 
angle provides the best efficiency for its functioning. Ramjets can be particularly useful in applications requiring a 
small and simple mechanism for high-speed use, such as missiles.

Pa. It is also noted that the primary shockwave gets converged with secondary shockwaves, due to which the primary 
shockwave is not hitting the cowl at the cowl tip.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Considering the advent of research in the field of Ramjet Engines, this paper describes the effect of varying inlet nose 
cone angles and concavities on pressure recovery ratio. Initially, the model geometry is considered by varying the 
inlet nose cone angles from 6° to 20° in steps of 2°. Upon selection of the ideal nose cone angle, the best configuration 
is suggested by analyzing the performance of the nose cone angle at various concavities. The concavity is varied from 
2.794 mm to 4.826 mm in the steps of 0.508 mm. 
The inlet nose cone angle of 11° is used to validate the model by simulating the setup suggested in the literature. The 
boundary conditions mentioned in the literature are applied in the simulations. The obtained pressure recovery ratio 
plots and pressure contours fall in good agreement with the literature results. The same setup is used for the study of 
configurations with variable nose cone angles. It is noted that high back pressure in case of 20° causes the heated air 
to leak out of the inlet region, reducing system efficiency and leading to an aerodynamic stall. With respect to the 
effect of angle, it can be concluded that the 11° nose cone angle has the best pressure recovery ratio. The results 
obtained from variable nose cone angles are further extended to note the effects of variable concavity. The concavity 
of 3.81mm was suggested in the literature. The effects of various concavities, ranging from 2.794 mm to 4.826 mm, 
are investigated in this study. It is found that an aerodynamic stall is obtained in the case of 4.826 mm. Importantly, 
in the present study, it is noted that a concavity of 4.318 mm gave the best pressure recovery at 11° nose cone angle.  
It can be concluded that variation in inlet nose cone angles leads to non-monotonic changes in pressure recovery ratio. 
At a smaller nose cone angle, lesser number of secondary shockwaves are being produced and as a result, the primary 
shockwave hits the cowl tip. Since the number of primary shockwaves being produced are less at smaller nose cone 
angles, the pressure recovery ratio is low. With an increase in the size of concavity, the number of secondary 
shockwaves increases, and hence the pressure recovery also increases. But at large nose cone angles (θ1 > 11°), more 
number of secondary shockwaves deflect the primary shockwave within the cowl surface. As a result, overall 
shockwave propagation is disturbed due to the deflections, reducing the pressure recovery ratio. Also, the presence of 
concavity along the ramp surface alters the flow leading to a total pressure rise in the concavity models. Hence, with 
the increase in concavity, a gradual increase in the pressure recovery ratio is observed.  
 
Proposed Improvements 
Further improvements to precisely gauge the pressure recovery ratio by considering the addition of the diffuser at the 
inlet nose cone.  While the compression ramp and isolator region play a significant role in compressing the inlet stream 
of air, the diffuser further contributes to the pressure recovery ratio.  A study on the design of the diffuser in the inlet 
nose cone would suggest the ideal geometry for supersonic applications.

Abstract 
The growing interest in Cu-based shape memory alloys is significant today. Most of the research has been done on 
Ni-based shape-memory alloys and across the variety of classes, since Cu-based shape-memory alloys have the 
ability to be fabricated very easily by induction melting are available at low cost and possess very good mechanical 
stability. The importance of inclusion of Manganese in Cu based shape memory alloys, which states that the 
improvement in manganese leads to high working temperature conditions for shape memory alloy [8]. So, in the 
present study an attempt is made with further improvement in the manganese content by careful study in order to 
produce a very high temperature SMA with the composition of CuMn13Al 7. Structural analysis on the test samples 
are performed by X-ray diffraction, DSC and Pseudo Elastic effect. The shape memory ratio, recoverable strains are 
tested and these two are the two main design parameters for the SMA application. In this paper the shape memory 
effect is presented. Developed shape memory alloy can be used for actuator applications over a large number of 
thermal cycles.

Abstract 
Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water without soil. It is type of horticulture and subset of 
Hydroculture. The water must be enriched with nutrients and the plants need some type of inert medium to support 
the root system. The research gaps were identified after the detailed review of literature. Extant literatures show that 
Hydroponics farming is more efficient and high yielding. But very limited studies are made in comparison with the 
traditional farming. Few studies also examined that there is less awareness about Hydroponics farming to the people. 
Also, there was not detailed study about challenges regarding hydroponics farming and subsidies which help to setup 
it. Thus, we are trying to fill this gap through our study.

1. Introduction
Hydroponic farming is thriving in India. One of the major factors driving its growth is also the technology curve that 
diminishes costs and helps in scaling its operations. Further, integration of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics 
measure important indicators that help in food/crop planning and hence help connect in the food security ecosystem. 
Besides the technological factors, the need for creating a smarter and green market in highly populous nations also 
creates space for hydroponic farming (rooftop or vertical farming) to grow as a trend. Even though the growth of 
hydroponics in Indian agriculture is rising every year, it seems there is still a large population of farmers who are not 
much aware about hydroponic systems. In this research paper we try to study the awareness of Indian farmers about

5.3 Recommendations for future research 
Our study was done only in the north and south urban regions of the Bangalore. The results may be different for 
different states. Future research can be done on other states which can help in a more accurate analysis. 
 
The sample survey was done on hydroponic farmers and their customers from our visit of 4 hydroponic farms. Opinions 
on others like Distributors, E-Commerce suppliers were not taken so further research including information from these 
sources would help to provide another alternative perspective on this subject. 
 
The farms we visited were not large-scale commercial farms. So further study can be conducted on larger commercial 
farms to see how the results differ from this study. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The research paper focuses on the role of hydroponics in the Indian agriculture. Hydroponics is a highly effective 
approach utilized in a variety of agricultural domains and also during the natural disasters. However, hydroponics 
requires less manpower, but it is still costly and complex, with high productivity. The awareness about hydroponics 
among the people was less; many people did not have a clear picture about Hydroponics. From this research we found 
out that many people do not prefer Hydroponics farming as the initial investment cost is very high and the financial 
support provided by the subsidies in the Government for Hydroponics farming are very less compared to traditional 
farming. Even though there is huge demand for Hydroponics produce as it is organic, medium and small-scale farmers 
faced the majority of difficulty in distribution and marketing. Among all the hydroponics produce greens have a huge 
demand. 
The main purpose of this paper was to create awareness among farmers in India about the benefits of hydroponic 
farming when compared to traditional farming and to understand the various challenges faced by them in India in 
setting up a hydroponic farm.

Abstract 
The adoption of the new Hybrid Education model during the pandemic altered the teaching-learning techniques that 
posed instructors and students with a slew of obstacles as they attempted to adapt to the digital modes of 
communication. The objective of this research is to discover new challenges faced by teachers and students which 
stayed as roadblocks in the Technology adoption process. The research provides a new framework for depicting 
several stages of student-teacher digital involvement. A qualitative approach is employed in order to arrive at a 
grounded Theory. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques are used to contact teachers and students. The 
findings indicate that teachers and students are now confronted with a variety of new obstacles like Unstable internet 
connectivity, work-life imbalance, unethical methods, and response verification dilemma. The Exploration resulted 
in the development of a new framework that identified four quadrants depicting phases of student-teacher digital 
interaction.  The outcomes of this study assist institutional management authorities in identifying the numerous 
problems that they would face when implementing online teaching-learning methods. The research is the first 
attempt to unite student-teacher conflicts by proposing a four-quadrant framework, thereby giving a road map for 
educational institutions seeking to increase students' self-reliance.

Introduction
Coronavirus-19, one of the most devasting worldwide pandemics in history, emphasized the importance of 
enhancing public health and socioeconomic policies to prevent the mortality and morbidity caused by this virus. 
These health and social measures include personal safety measures; environmental measures; and measures of 
supervision. (World Health Organization, 2020). The most major change made with the implementation of the 
aforementioned steps was the global lockdown. This pandemic has wreaked havoc on India's economy (Das, 2020). 
Education is no exception. When this lockdown was declared, it immediately halted all academic-related activity 
taking place across the country. The velocity at which teaching-learning techniques shifted dramatically was not 
anticipated in previous works of literature, and perhaps the teaching profession was not prepared to face such a 
circumstance. These extraordinary times have brought to light significant impediments to information exchange.

The above-proposed model represents the levels of digital involvement from students and teachers in this new Tech-
based Education Model. The vertical axis represents the teachers’ digital involvement, and the horizontal axis 
represents the student’s digital Involvement. The “+ (positive) sign” in the framework represents the deepest level of 
digital involvement and the “- (negative) sign” represents the least level of digital involvement. 
The Ist quadrant represents a level where the teachers are doing their best to adapt to the new ways of teaching, but 
students are unable to cope with the new digital environment. Students are overloaded with the content, classes, and 
other upgradations and they are finding it difficult to cope-up. Hence this involvement is called WEBINAR 
SICKNESS. The IInd quadrant represents a high level of digital involvement from both ends i.e Teachers and 
Students. This level of involvement is ground-breaking and is proposed to be known as INNOVATIVE ROUTINE. 
IIIrd quadrant represents a completely off-track situation where both parties are extremely affected negatively by the 
new Tech-based Education Model. This level represents the worst condition of the education sector and is thus 
called DERAILING. Finally, the IVth quadrant represents a situation where students are completely accustomed to 
the new digital environment, but the teachers are failing to cope up. Teachers are unable to contribute and thus this 
level is creating a bar or a CEILING. 
 
5.4. Implications for the Proposed Framework 
The suggested conceptual model has the potential to make significant contributions and expand the existing 
literature in this field of teaching-learning in the new normal. These results allow educational institutions to assess 
the level of engagement of their professors and students in the digital age. Schools and institutions can quickly 
collect data from students and instructors and plot the points in one of four quadrants, so providing a clear image of 
the total success of Knowledge Exchange. This model could assist educational institutions in assessing their current 
level and implementing strategies to advance to a stage that is conducive to the growth and prosperity of the 
education sector. This methodology would assist the educational entity in identifying the deficiency and instilling 
the measures necessary to overcome the restrictions faced by teachers and/or students. Institutions, colleges, and 
schools can develop action plans to attain the INNOVATIVE ROUTINE level to overcome all of the problems. 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the findings, the study suggests that both students and teachers commit to bring education to a condition of 
complete satisfaction on both ends to reach a degree of complete self-reliance. The flaws highlighted in the 
preceding sections are raised from both the instructor and student perspectives. The largest obstacle faced by 
teachers and students is the network problem and the need for both sides to adapt to the changing instructional 
patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to offer teachers and students, full access to technology and sufficient training for 
teaching, learning, and evaluating. Another difficulty was recreating the environment that existed in formal 
teaching-learning physical classrooms, as practically all interviewees favoured offline classes for superior 
information transmission in both directions. This issue requires significant effort to resolve. One of the new concepts 
uncovered by this research was the Answer Verification Dilemma faced by teachers, which rendered them incapable 
of confirming the authenticity of a student's response to the non-performance of a task. The difficulty was to 
determine whether the kids' comments were logical or an attempt to evade responsibility. This research report also 
offered a novel model depicting the many levels of student-teacher interaction, dubbed the Self-reliance window, 
which depicts the relationship between the levels of student digital involvement and instructor digital involvement. 
This window presents four levels of digital involvement - Quadrant 1- Webinar Sickness, Quadrant 2- Innovative 
Routine, Quadrant 3- Derailing, and Quadrant 4- Ceiling - allowing the education sector to assess the current 
student-teacher digital involvement relationship and take steps to strengthen it. 
In brief, the study described the many obstacles that teachers and students experienced as a result of the 
implementation of the new Tech-based CEM. The paper's findings were based on previous research and open-ended 
interviews with teachers and students in the new institutional system. With the new online teaching-learning 
systems, both students and instructors encountered numerous obstacles, which is highly aggravating. New levels of 
Digital participation patterns have been investigated, and a new model is offered.

Abstract 
With a growing concern for environment and mounting pressure from stakeholders in the manufacturing 
ecosystem, there has been a movement for the manufacturing firms to take the route of green manufacturing and 
green innovation. Green manufacturing innovation involved developing a green awareness, having green 
manufacturing systems in place, developing a green manufacturing culture and continuous improvement towards 
excellence. Automobile and Earthmoving sectors being one of the large contributors to manufacturing economy 
in India clearly lacked a framework to pursue green manufacturing practices. To understand the green 
manufacturing practices, to differentiate the ‘leaders’ and ‘followers’ in green manufacturing innovation, and to 
predict green innovation index (score), this research surveyed 70 predominantly small and medium manufacturing 
firms and a few large firms of automobile and earthmoving sectors in Karnataka, comprising both ancillaries and 
assemblers. Multiple Linear Regression was employed with a ‘green innovation index’ of a firm as the dependent 
variable and factor scores (from exploratory factor analysis) as independent variables. Key factors that determined 
the green innovation index were - ability to recycle, recovery management, green stakeholder support, green 
commitment of employees, green value chain, cost and resource assessment, green design, strategic alignment 
towards green manufacturing, Reuse and implementation of 3R’s.

Abstract 
Coagulation plays a very crucial role in the treatment of potable water, especially in consumption of drinking water 
for human kind. Aluminium sulfate is the most common chemical coagulant. Aloe vera is widely acknowledged as a 
plant with numerous uses. It is useful in medicine, but utilization of Aloe Vera using in various water and waste 
water treatments can be used as a low cost adsorbent instead of high cost adsorbent. In this study, some natural 
coagulants have been explained for the coagulation process. Water is an important resource for the survival of life. 
This study focused on developing an efficient and cost-effective processing technique by using Aloe Vera gel to 
produce natural coagulant for use in raw water treatment. The turbidity removal efficiency of alum and aloe vera 
powder are 89.65% at coagulant dose 40mg/l and 77.68% at coagulant dose 150mg/l respectively. The results 
showed that the alum is more effective than aloe vera but some drawbacks have been seen in using alum, as it 
induces Alzheimer's disease because of its carcinogenic properties. So aloe vera powder is reduced the Alzheimer's 
disease.

1. Introduction
Portable water is indispensable in terms of sustaining life; clean drinking water is a basic human need. Water is a 
precious and essential natural resource, unevenly distributed on our planet. Freshwater represents only 2.5% of 
global supplies of water. About 70% of this freshwater quantity are either trapped under ice caps, or disseminated in 
the form of humidity or steam. Less than 1% of fresh water, about 0.007% of the planet's water, is easily accessible 
to the various uses for development (Irma, et al. 2016). The scarcity of drinking water is now becoming a global 
matter of concern in urban as well as rural areas of several countries.  
In the 1980s, these studied were based on surface water and the estimate of a number of factors, such as coagulant 
kind, coagulant dose, pH and raw water characteristics (Wiley 1989). Next introduction in the coagulation 
technology was streaming current detector (SCD), which was extensively used along with jar test in regulating 
coagulant dosage and therefore process (Dentel, Thomas and Kingery 1989). 
In chemical coagulants, alum is generally used in water treatment. The use of alum as a coagulant increase the 
aluminum concentration in treated water (Altaher and Alghamdi 2011). Alum has various negative effects on human 
health, including Alzheimer's disease.  
The use of natural resources in the process of water treatment, thus constitutes a potential promising ways to reduce 
on one hand, the high costs and environmental impacts due to the use of synthetic products used previously (Amruta 
and Munavalli 2017). Native to the Indian subcontinent is the Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis) family Asphodelaceae. 
Aloe Vera's positive uses in the food business, pharmaceutical industry, cosmetics industry, etc. are attributed to its

characterising potential local resources (plant- and/or animal-based) that could be used as natural coagulants, 
optimising extraction process conditions, and assessing other types of wastewater with various characteristics. In 
conclusion, taking into account all the benefits, the use and development of natural coagulants have promising 
futures as a green technology with a workable, long-term solution for reducing water pollution. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study was mainly focused on the preparation of Aloe vera; study on its performance and effectiveness as a 
coagulant in the water. Alum was give better result compared to Aloe vera. The turbidity of raw water is reduced by 
87.62% with Alum; and 78.48% with Aloe vera powder as the coagulant. Hence, it is better to use the natural 
coagulant aloe vera during raw water treatment. This is also effective in terms of cost and environmentally friendly 
and coagulation-flocculation activities. Aloe vera may be effectively employed as a natural coagulant for the 
treatment of raw water, according to this experimental investigation. As a result, natural coagulants may substitute 
alum without affecting how well the procedure works.

Abstract 
 
The hospitality industry contributes about 6.23% to the GDP of a country and 8.78% of employment in the country. 
This sector has seen strong growth in recent years due to the massive inflow of foreign travelers, and the movement 
of national tourists has also increased. World stock markets are declining now as investors become more concerned 
about the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hotels, travel & tourism, and airlines have also experienced 
enormous losses. This study examines the effect of hospitality stock returns during the COVID-19 pandemic period, 
i.e., hospitality sectors, on stock index returns (Nifty 50) during the pandemic period. The weekly rate of hospitality 
stock index return (Nifty50) was considered for the study. A dummy variable was used to measure the effectiveness 
of the hospitality stock returns during March-May 2020. The study period was restricted from March 25th, 2020 to 
May 31st, 2020. The GARCH Model was used to analyse the data, and the results were validated using Residual 
Diagnostics. Finally, this study reveals a significant impact on hospitality stock returns during the COVID-19 
pandemic period.

1. Introduction  
The hospitality industry has been affected the most as a result of travel limits imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
both internationally and within India. Hygienic emergencies distress the hospitality sector in immeasurable ways, 
including the deficiency of occupations of local people; advance reimbursement responsibility of affected 
organizations, and low to no habitation paces of hotels that may prompt impermanent or perpetual end; and income 
issues. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the government has approached with supporting measures, for example, the 
all-inclusive Wage Assistance Scheme for the hospitality industry, drawn-out credit bans and low loan costs, and the 
waiver of the rental installment of state lands for the forthcoming fiscal year to tide over the liquidity issues. The 
Mauritius Investment Corporation (MIC) has additionally been set up to propose interests in qualified organizations 
through various speculation devices, including both value and semi-value instruments. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic will remain in our amassed memory for quite a while into the future as a result of its 
perplexing impact at different levels on the overall economy. With continuing government support and the help of

Based on the validation results, we intend to reject the alternative hypothesis (H1) that there is no serial correlation in 
the residuals because Q-statistics are insignificant in all distributions with a large p>0.05 and accept the null hypothesis 
(Ho) that there is a serial correlation in the residuals because Q-statistics are significant in all distributions with a large 
p<0.05. 
 
Model selection: 
Following a residual diagnostic check, it was discovered that the GARCH Model with all distributions was satisfactory 
with the test for serial correlation. The ARCH-test for heteroskedasticity and the normality test with Jarque-Bera 
statistics are used to determine heteroskedasticity and normality. As a result, all of the models are acceptable. As a 
result, the most desirable model will be the generalised error distribution. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study tries to explore the interaction between 31 hospitality companies' stock returns and stock index returns 
during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The volatility of Indian stock market returns has been modelled by using 
GARCH models that capture the most common stylized facts about stock returns during the pandemic period with the 
help of ML ARCH-Normal distribution (BFGS/Marquardt Steps). This study used data from the 1st of March to the 
31st of May 2020 as an exogenous variable, and a dummy variable was used to measure the influence of the COVID-
19 pandemic on the hospitality industry. The findings of the ARCH test conducted point out the significant presence 
of ARCH effects in the hospitality stock returns during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The perception of investor 
behaviour has a significant impact on the hospitality stock market as well.

Abstract 
The purpose and operation of prisons has been the subject of official and unofficial scrutiny for decades. Despite a 
lengthy history of excellent jail administration, scholars, lawmakers, the government, and companies have been 
interested in prison reform or effective management. To turn convicts into law-abiding citizens, the government needs 
to highlight their human rights and quality of life The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) is responsible for 
providing prisoners with a secure, safe, and compassionate environment and establishing rehabilitation and 
reintegration programmes. This research has been conducted in two parts. In the first phase, the researchers will assess 
existing legislation and offer appropriate jail management rules and services. The team will study prison management 
philosophy to achieve a balance between inmates' rights and correctional services. In the second part, the researchers 
will examine whether current rules need to be changed to provide effective jail regulation and correctional services. 
All data sets, laws and regulations will be examined to create a model for successful jail management that balances 
regulation and correctional services. The investigators intend to study the best practices and the impact of COVID-19 
on correctional services. The extensive and rigorous literature review (SLR) will help to find improvement areas, 
conduct a survey, validate ideas, and implement the suggestions practically.

Abstract 
Firms across sectors have gone global, entered foreign markets, exported, and imported products & services through 
various international business strategies. The dynamics of the higher education sector in India have seen a rapid shift 
with changing regulations, a revolutionary New Education Policy (NEP), and a spurt in the quality & features of 
virtual education. There is a growing excitement of opening campuses and goal posts across borders, while facing an 
uncertain future due to the impending entry of foreign universities and institutions in the country. Extant research in 
higher education lacks insight into the application of concept of global strategy for competing in the larger 
competitive environment. This paper aims to bridge this gap by identifying the drivers for development of various 
innovative & flexible international business strategies that can be applied to higher education institutions (HEIs). 
Previous studies show that HEIs are faced with a challenge that there is no single pattern in the wide range of 
choices made by students based on different variables, such as motivation, culture, language, online education, 
economic & political situations, employability, and other aspects. Findings indicate that study abroad, semester 
abroad, immersion programs, credit transfer pathways & twinning arrangements through university collaborations, 
are few of the models for gaining international education that have encouraged students to stay home while being 
able to achieve the distinction & benefits of international education. The research builds a conceptual framework for 
the various drivers of international business strategy and proposes a model for Global Citizen Development (GCD) 
which is validated using Content Validity Ratio (CVR) with a case study approach.

1. Introduction
Indian higher education is complex, extremely fragmented, and riddled with many contradictions (Kapur, 2010). It 
has been witnessing a huge demand from college aspirants and as Indian higher education institutions (HEIs) failed 
to meet the growing numbers, these were absorbed worldwide and multiplied with increasing realization of better 
prospects. 
Figure 1 shows that a large and growing number of students go abroad for studies, just like the 18,000 students who 
were enrolled in higher education institutions Ukraine when the country was invaded by Russia in March 2022. 
The trend is now changing as the mode, formats and drivers have been seeing paradigm shifts leading to exciting 
possibilities for increased contribution of higher education towards service exports and to ever broadening 
competitive frameworks, as well as mutually beneficial partnerships. The focus of Indian public policy has also 
shifted from preventing brain drain to encouraging brain circulation with academic collaborations. (UGC, 2022). 
Indian HEIs have come a long way through active capacity building, particularly over the last decade, and have been 
taking many initiatives on the international front to nurture the intellectual life of all stakeholders. The trends and

5. Conclusions and Future Research 
Indian HEIs have the potential to make their own mark in the world and end the growing debate of why they are not 
able to break into the top table of rankings. With growing competitive forces, there is a strong need for global 
positioning that is balanced with fulfilling the need gap of the students. However, Internationalization of higher 
education has been very sparsely studied through strategic lenses. There is a need to look at this area beyond 
neoliberalism & a presently limited vision. 
 
This study has proposed a comprehensive framework of drivers for strategies of international business that provide a 
new direction of global citizen development. The simple international business strategy of expansion into new 
markets through opening of a branch campus or acquisition has not been a preferred route for Indian higher 
education institutions until now when IITs are being invited by other countries. Smaller degrees of collaboration like 
curriculum validation, faculty & student mobility, as well as joint research have low execution costs and high levels 
of outcomes that can assist in increasing brand equity, which is going to be an important parameter of consideration 
when finalizing any dual or joint degree arrangement.  
 
This framework provides a foundation for future researchers to validate and develop in detail along each parameter 
& proposed strategic dimension. There is potential to deploy better qualitative and quantitative research methods to 
draw deeper insights that can make contributions to practice, policy, and scholarship.

Abstract 
Crop insurance is one of the utmost significant tools which can be used in agriculture to protect farmers against 
loss. PMFBYS plays a major for the betterment of agriculture by providing financial assistance to farmers, 
stabilizing the income of the farmers, encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices, 
etc. The present study focuses on to Analyse the inter-relationship between the factors affecting the PMFBY 
scheme with respect to time. The study considers five variables claim amount, farmer’s share premium, number 
of insured, sum insured and area insured ha. From 2016 to 2022 for six years of PMFBYS started till now in 
Karnataka. The study is carried out on Descriptive statistics, VAR (Vector Auto Regression) Estimation, Least 
square with the dependent variable for each five variable with individual formulas, Roots of Characteristics 
Polynomial, VAR Granger Causality/Block Exogeneity wald Tests, VAR Residual Normality Tests, VAR 
Residual Serial Correlation LM Tests. In this, regard the model satisfies the stability condition and helps for 
further study on PMFBYS.

1. Introduction
Agricultural Sector includes extra hazard factors and suspicions when it tries to compare with other major 
industrial and service sectors. Karnataka state is one of the large producers of food crops in India(H.V, 2015). 
Nearly they produce five-point zero two percent food grains total in Karnataka. At the time of the increasing effect 
of climate change all over through frequent scarcity, unbalanced rainfalls, increase in global temperature, drought 
(R. K. Ghosh et al., 2021), etc. To overcome such problems and to save farmers from loss, crop insurance takes a 
major role. Agriculture insurance company of India limited”, in various states of India with different schemes, 
some of the insurances are implemented by the government such as Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana 
Scheme(Jain et al., 2020). The newly introduced scheme PMFBY affords extensive insurance protection against 
failure of the crops and assists in soothing the income of the insured farmers(Singh & Kumar Singh, 2019).  
The primary objective of crop insurance is to, protect farmers from financial loss and act as a guiding tool in risk 
management(S. Ghosh, 2019). In crop insurance, food crops can be considered as a major tool for other crop 
insurance. Food crops are paddy, green gram, wheat, maize, rice, millets and pulses etc.  
The farmers will be deciding the type of crop insurance they need and the capacity to pay premium. Farmer who 
is willing to apply for loan for them Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana Scheme is compulsory and the scheme is 
elective for non-loanee farmers(H.V, 2015). For food crop insurance, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana Scheme 
is contributing more benefits and facilities with different premium rates. PMFBYS is applicable for both rabi and 
kharif season as well (Paulraj & Easwaran, 2020). The premium for PMFBYS is less compared to other schemes 
and it also reduces the (Rajbee 2022) burden of the farmers who receipts loan and safeguard them against 
intemperate weather(Paulraj & Easwaran, 2020). The PMFBYS was implemented to remove the numerous

Figure 2. Normality test on profitability as dependent variable 
From Figure 2, the probability value is 0.000, which means it is less than the significance level i.e., 0.05, so we 
reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis states that residuals are normally distributed, and it is accepted for 
the best fit model. 
 
6. Conclusion: 
The Government created several crop insurances programs to safeguard all farmers' hard work and efforts around 
the country. So that farmers may quickly obtain the claim amount and have their losses covered. Crop insurance 
schemes were created to help farmers reduce their losses. It offers financial assistance and encouragement to crop 
loss farmers, the loss caused by natural disasters, pests, and diseases. The PMFBY scheme plays a major role in 
agriculture and benefits farmers. This study carries the initial step in identifying a different variable and correlating 
the effect of the PMFBY scheme in Karnataka. The study also involved a Unite root test, criteria order selection 
has base test for the analysis. Once after this analysing VAR estimation with the help of each individual variable 
has been considered with the formula to find the least square. The least-squares method is a statistical procedure 
to find the best fit for a set of data points by minimising the sum of the offsets or residuals of points from the 
plotted curve. Least squares regression is used to predict the behaviour of dependent variables. This was 
considered for each variable to know the probability and the fit. The second test was done on the root of 
polynomial characteristics. To find its stabilising condition. The third variable, the VAR Granger Casualty, was 
considered to know all the five variables, which help us predict the dependent variable. VAR Residual Serial 
Correlation LM Tests help to know, as a result, neither test can rule out the possibility of no serial correlation. In 
other words, from lag 1 to 3, there is no evidence of serial correlation. Thus, it can be concluded that the VAR 
model satisfies the stability condition. Therefore, all the variable’s holds good for the study.

Abstract 
The socio-economic prestige of women is a good predictor of civilization. Social status of women is influenced by 
their economic circumstances. Women’s place in the decision-making process is determined by their socioeconomic 
status, which opens the door to even more independence. Women in rustic ranges, as well as public ranges, are now 
taking the initiative to put their skills to work in order to earn a living. Women's equality in society is achieved through 
increased awareness. Females' economic standing in society can be improved by encouraging them to invest in a 
variety of investment opportunities. In the past, women were not as conscious of investment trends as men were. 
Women in both the urban and rural areas now have specific investing goals, such as children's education, marriages, 
tax savings, wealth accumulation, future security, and so on. This study targets to analyze the various investment 
behavior of women and to identify the factors influencing women behavior on various investment patterns. The study 
focused on Women of Bathinda District in Punjab. The primary data has been collected from 83 females by distributing 
the structured questionnaire. The data has been analysed through chi- square test and t-test with the help of Statistical 
Package of Social Science (SPSS). The result shows that all the women have same attitude on their investment and 
the interest rate is most influencing factor deciding the investment behavior of women in urban and rural area.

1. Introduction
In the earlier days, men were the only earners in the family. The rest of the family members, children, wives, sisters, 
younger’s, parents are dependent on only one person for their daily expenses. With the advancement of time, women 
of the nation are also started to earn their livelihood. When women start to earn money, the unemployment level starts 
decreasing which directly increases the GDP growth of the nation. The highest increase of unemployment percent 
goes to 23.75%. India faces many up and down during the covid-19 and recovering from this phase not only males 
but women also play a vital role to recover the growth of the nation.  
Women start to empower themselves from (MSME’S). This statement was given by the minister of women 
empowerment and child protection, Bintang Puspayoga. These women not only adjust the demand of markets but also 
lead a new marketing trend. Nowadays women are also coming in front and contributing to the growth of the nation 
by developing new entities. Yes, in the society of male chauvinism it is very challenging for females to accept the 
term of entrepreneurship. But now women are giving answers to the male dominating society by providing 
employment opportunities in an innovative way with an ability of risk-taking. 
There are many kinds of women entrepreneurs like an Affluent, these women are the family members of a well-his 
scheme settled entrepreneur. The second type is of pull entrepreneurs, these are the women of urban areas who are 
willingly taking risks for something new and the financial helpless for them are commercial banks or any institute of 
finance. The third type comes to push entrepreneurs where women force themselves for starting new businesses 
because either they become widows or get divorced from husbands. They build small entities for their livelihood. 
Urban women are mostly coming forward in the Bhartiya Mahila Bank which merged with the state bank of India in

Table 9 exhibits the result of independent T-test for rural and urban women concerning the influencers for making 
investment decisions. The mean value of the rural women is 1.66 which is very near to value 2, which means to say that 
interest rate is the factor which influences more for taking decisions among rural women. The mean value of the urban 
women is 1.93 which is very near to value 3, which means to say that interest rate is the factor which influences more for 
taking decision s among urban women.  Since, the P value is 0.99 which is more than the 0.05 level of significance. It clearly 
shows that the null hypothesis is accepted. It means that there is no significant difference between factors influencing 
investment behavior of rural and urban women. So, finally the interest rate is most influencing factor deciding the investment 
behavior of women in urban and rural area.  
 
 Suggestions  
● 
Making investments are good to bear the future expenses and to make future secured. 
● 
Investment should be done in a manner so that an investee can get high return with less risk. 
● 
Before investing money, investee should carefully consider the level of risk connected with the investment. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Nowadays, women represent the investment sector. It becomes essential that women should take their own decisions which 
will make the nation modernized and help for women empowerment. To increase the wealth management firms, firms 
should focus on accomplishing the needs of female investors. This study gives a detailed description about the investment 
behavior and the factors influencing women behavior on various investment patterns of women in Bathinda district of 
Punjab. They prefer to make investments in bank accounts and in post office for the safety purpose. Safety is the foremost 
thing that influences saving and investment decisions. In our study 13.3 percent of the respondent are investing the money 
for the purpose of tax savings. Most of the respondents are saving the money to fulfill their social obligations such as 
marriage of a child, further education of children’s. Study shows that most of the women are investing the money in 
traditional way especially in Bathinda district and they are not that much aware about the innovative ways to invest their 
money. The data has been analysed through chi- square test which shows that there is no association between women 
Educational level and having Bank account for making investments in study area. We also studied Independent sample T-
Test for Rural and Urban women concerning the influencers for making investment decisions which concludes that the 
interest rate is most influencing factor deciding the investment behavior of women in urban and rural area. So, Investment 
should be done in a manner so that an investee can get high return with less risk. Before investing money, investee should 
carefully consider the level of risk connected with the investment. The Financial awareness programmes must be organized 
which will promote the financial literacy, it also provides people with a foundational grasp of financial concepts that can 
help them make better financial decisions in the real world. They'll be better able to manage their money, make wise 
judgments, and maintain healthy spending and budgeting habits as a result of this knowledge, which will contribute to 
financial wellness over time. The primary advantage of financial literacy is that it allows to make informed financial 
decisions. It teaches how to budget, save, borrow, and invest money successfully and to meet financial objectives with 
financial stability.

Abstract 
Early studies have already reported an increase in anxiety, and depression in the general population, especially those 
facing extended lockdowns. These effects are magnified in the elderly population due to stricter lockdowns, higher 
threat of illness, and loss of social support. Older people are being challenged by requirements to spend more time at 
home, lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, temporary cessation of employment 
and other activities; and anxiety and fear of illness and death of their own and others. It is therefore important that we 
create opportunities to foster healthy ageing during the pandemic. Population considered for this study was elder 
individuals from age 60 to 90 of Bangalore urban region. Questionnaire survey based on Likert scale was used in this 
study and data was collected from 152 elder people. Prior to that, the developed questionnaire was subjected to a pilot 
study and reliability of the questionnaire was checked by finding the Cronbach’s alpha value.  Descriptive analysis 
and independent sample t-test were conducted to reach the objectives.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 has spread worldwide causing an unprecedented public health crisis and drastically changing the lives of 
countless members of the general population. Widespread lockdown and preventative measures have isolated 
individuals, affected the world economy, and limited access to physical and mental healthcare (Conroy, K.M., 
Krishnan, S., Mittelstaedt, S. and Patel, S.S., 2020). While these measures may be necessary to minimize the spread

Various aspects were analyzed to understand the situation and response of the elderly population during and after the 
pandemic. Different aspects were analyzed by considering the objectives of the study and the questionnaire was 
developed. The data was collected through a questionnaire on the Likert scale to understand the response of the elderly 
population.  
The questionnaire was prepared considering the factors like if they were aware of the symptoms, and the preventive 
measures to be taken, we discovered that they were not aware of them initially during the onset of the pandemic while 
the awareness was created gradually which also resulted in them getting used to following the covid-19 protocols. An 
analysis of the challenges they faced, how they responded to the different situations, and the necessary changes they 
have adapted in their life due to the pandemic was done which revealed the lack of awareness on using the 
technological applications, difficulties in using smart devices and impact ongoing cash to the cashless transaction was 
studied.  
The study also focused on the effects of the pandemic on mental health, the support, and assistance they were provided 
during and after the pandemic, the social support, economic well-being the inconvenience faced by the elderly 
population. Through the combined aspect of economic wellbeing and awareness, the study also had a major objective 
of creating awareness about the government initiatives, schemes, and policies provided to the elderly population.

Abstract 
Every company in this competitive world wants to increase its revenue share. One of the ways to increase revenue 
is by increasing production. In this study it was observed that the delay in production was because of the ordering 
process. Elimination of the delays from order processing, can increase the production. Workflow activities have 
inherent data interrelationships and errors in data can impact on other related activities. Considered human factor 
from which errors might get generate in information flow. Another reason for delays could be not taking corrective 
action on previous issues in time. This paper tried to optimize the order processing procedure by automating 
intermediate manual activities of order processing to eliminate errors and proposed a method to effectively 
prioritizing the issues to take corrective action, this can lead to decrease wastage of resources also. This approach 
will help to increase the production and ultimately revenue of the company.

1. Introduction
A multinational company is a supplier of fuel dispensers, point of sales systems, payment systems, forecourt 
merchandising and support services. Its major revenue share comes from fuel dispenser. XYZ sales their fuel 
dispenser through distributors and also directly to state run oil industries and private oil industries.  
Improvement is needed in the system in order to survive in global competition. This improvement should be more 
effective and efficient than earlier system while fulfilling customer’s demand. Increase in the production can be 
reflection of improvements in the system. And production can be increase by eliminating delays from order 
processing. 
Order reaches to customer service team in the company through regional team in configurator file (Configurator 
file has all the features of dispenser along with prices). The company is observing delays in order processing. 
These delays are divided in two stages i.e., 1) Order to sales order, 2) Sales order to dispatch. 
Observations: 
1)
Order to sales order: In this process it is observed that delays are happening due to errors in information
flow, that is customer service team has to fill two forms (Order summary or checklist and customer order
acknowledgment (OA)) for engineering team and customer respectively after getting order from regional
team. Engineering team makes BOM by referring order summary form and customer service gets order
confirmation by customer’s signature on customer OA form. This confirmation gets in four working
days. Order summary and customer OA are filled manually. If error happens while filling these forms,
that error will flow through the system, and it will be unnoticeable until customer ask for amendment in
OA form. Due to this order to sales order stage takes more than two weeks of time.
2)
Sales order to dispatch: Delays are notice in this stage due to not taking corrective actions on previous
issues in time. And this is because of ambiguity in prioritization of issues.
Ultimate impact of such delays is decrease in the production. By optimizing order processing procedures will lead 
to increase in production as well as the revenue of the organization.

From above both the table 10 and table 11, we can spot that issue no. 6 has higher cost impact. 
4. Results and Outcomes
4.1 Objective 1
Time taken to fill order summary and customer OA form has been reduced after automating the form filling
process. Below table 12 shows time taken by before and after automating the process.

From above comparison it can be seen that, old process taking average time of 243.75 min in 4 weeks to fill order 
summary and customer OA form and new process taking only 48.75 min (Table 12).  
4.2 Objective 2 
Issue prioritization is based on QDRF no. higher the QDRF no. higher the priority. 
By comparing table no. 8 and 9, it is observed that issue no. 6 has higher cost impact, and this issue needs to be 
taken as first priority to take corrective action. Similarly issue no. 8 and 9 need to be taken as second priority, and 
so on. 
5. Conclusion
Delays can slow the order processing process, and ultimately reduce the production that company intended to 
achieve in constrained resources. As delays are observed in order processing process due to errors in information 
flow. Order processing delay is an indicator that orders processing function is not an effective and efficient 
process. These errors are eliminated by automating manual form filling process i.e., Order Summary and Customer 
Order Acknowledgment form using excel. Standard template is developed to understand all requirements of the 
customer along with terms and condition in Customer OA form. Due to automation human interference in the 
process got less, no need to assign resource to fill up form and give lot of time to verify and do amendment in the 
mistaken form as well as in BOM. Due to this 80% of the time is reduced in form the filling process. Also, no 
need to inform about delays due to this process and it also improve the image of the organization in customer.  
To show the cost impact of the issue, impact stage rating added in prioritization of issues along with rating of 
severity and occurrence. By multiplying all three criteria, it gives effective prioritized open siren issue for 
corrective action, and it also help to show which issue has highest cost impact. Ultimately both actions i.e., 
automating form filling process and open siren issue prioritization helps to reduce order execution time.

Abstract 
Research on rural women entrepreneurship has attracted the attention of several scholars as well as various governing 
bodies. In the literature, there have been several studies documenting the success and failure of rural women 
entrepreneurs. However, it is necessary to know the hierarchy of factors that impact the commencement of the 
businesses they manage. The purpose of this research is to identify the factors that influence rural women's decision 
in establishing a business venture. It is an attempt to compile a comprehensive list of criteria and rate them in terms 
of their impact on the advancement of rural women entrepreneurs. A literature review backed by expert opinion 
resulted in the identification of sixteen different variables and the authors used fuzzy AHP to come up with a 
comprehensive list of criteria and their degree of importance. An examination of the relative importance of these 
characteristics can assist policymakers by highlighting important aspects that affect the initiation of the business by 
rural women entrepreneurs. The findings have the potential to aid in effective decision making by policymakers 
through emphasizing critical elements relevant for entrepreneurial success.

1. Introduction
Economic thought on entrepreneurship philosophy can be traced back to 18th and 19th century with Richard Cantillon, 
Adam Smith, and Jean-Baptiste first expressing their opinions on the subject. After being overlooked for a long period 
of time, entrepreneurship research has gained momentum since the mid-20th century to become one of the most 
powerful, dynamic, and expanding topics in social sciences, extending its application in specialized journals and 
conferences encompassing a wide range of academic sub-disciplines (Braunerhjelm et al.2022).  According to 
Agarwal and Lenka (2015), entrepreneurship is a process of establishing new businesses and entrepreneurs use several 
resources in developing these businesses. The field of entrepreneurship is not restricted to a specific gender. Female 
entrepreneurs are marking their presence both nationally as well as globally (Agarwal and Lenka2016). The number 
of working women, particularly female entrepreneurs, have increased (Rastogi et al. 2022) and their significant role 
in developing small and medium businesses is leading to the growth of emerging economies. Research evidence shows 
that rural women are involved in several entrepreneurial activities which includes handicraft, catering business, food 
and beverage business etc. (Ghouse et al. 2021). However, when compared to their male counterparts’ they are unable

6.  Implications and Future Research Directions 
The research findings are valuable to researchers, academicians, and policymakers. It gives a framework for 
reorienting programs and policies to boost rural women’s entrepreneurial growth in the future. According to the study, 
the research findings will have an influence on government policies and will be an effective tool for implementing 
initiatives focused at empowering rural women entrepreneurs. The analysis brings out the significance of possible 
future research in the field of rural women entrepreneurship, resulting in creation of a long-term economic influence 
on the way of life of women entrepreneurs in the societal structure at large.  
 
Future research directions and recommendations for the study are: 
1. The study prioritizes the factors and ranks them; further research can be done on their strength and their inter-
relationship.  
2. The research specifically discusses the factors in general, they can further be validated with the help of a case.  
3. Factors can also be determined and assessed in context of a specific industry in which rural women entrepreneurs 
are involved. 
 
8. Conclusion 
Entrepreneurship is an emerging concept and in the present era women are consistently trying to break the biases and 
creating their own ventures for their personal growth as well as income flexibility. In the same way rural women are 
no different. They are creating small and medium enterprises by starting something on their own and empowering 
themselves to lead better lives and become independent. However, there are many factors which affects the initiation 
of their enterprises and act as challenges and barriers in their way forward. For successful implementation of policies 
and programs these factors need to be identified and prioritized to get meaningful insights about the status of rural 
women entrepreneurs. As a result, this research attempts to identify several elements that impact the initiation of 
businesses by rural women entrepreneurs through a literature review. The authors achieved objective 1 by obtaining 
factors influencing rural women entrepreneurs’ venture initiation and objective 2 by prioritizing and ranking these 
factors. Identifying factors available in the literature and grouping them along with the assistance of expert panel for 
offering their comments makes the process more meaningful. The study developed four groups of factors namely, 
personal, social, resource and technological. Fuzzy AHP is used as a technique to find both local and global weights 
for the factors with the guidance of expert opinion from the academia as well as budding women entrepreneurs. These 
factors are then ranked in order to identify which factors are most significant and which are least important in terms 
of their impact on rural women entrepreneurs. Analysis of the strength and inter-relationship between the factors along 
with the identification of variables from a specific industry have been recommended as prospective research areas.

Abstract 
Work-Life Balance is relatively undiscussed topic among the parents of special need children compared to parents of 
neuro-typical children. This article presents the results concluded by our own research aimed at determining factors 
influencing work-life balance in parents of special need children. The result is based on the analysis influence of total 
25 variables categorized into 3 major factors: day-To-Day factors, work-life factors, occupational factors, personal 
factors. The study explores this topic by addressing factors influencing work-life balance and its hardship faced by 
parents of special needs children. The ultimate aim of our work is to raise awareness and inspire parents with special 
needs children to look at their specific hardships and stage in life to understand what type of work-life balance 
programs and emotional support they would need in an organization or their colleagues can provide. With context of 
management if an organization in terms of their employers, understands what extra support parents of special needs 
children need, they will be able to get maximum productivity from their employee.

1. Introduction
Building a sustainable work-life balance culture within a company is a win-win for all. Dr. Fredrick F. Reichheld is a 
renowned speaker at major business forums and has stated, ""an increase in retention of just 5% can boost revenues 
25% to 100%”. In support of this, Forbes magazine has reported that not having work-life balance is one of the top 5 
reasons employees do not stay with a company.  
But what is Work-Life Balance? According to Susan Simmons, work-life balance means “bringing work, whether 
done on the job or at home, and leisure time into balance to live life to its fullest. It doesn’t mean that spend half of 
your life working and half of it playing; instead, it means balancing the two to achieve harmony in physical, emotional, 
and spiritual health” (Simmons). This balance is especially important for employees with special needs children 
because of the below stated few problems. 
Problem Statements 
Some of the major problems faced by parents of special needs children: 
•
Diverse Disabilities, Diverse Needs
No child is the same, even if they have the same handicap the type of special needs child a person has at home highly 
changes the type of work-life balance that is needed. Some people have special needs children who are hospitalized. 
There is also the difference as to whether a person’s special needs child is mentally or physically handicapped or, in 
some cases, both. Depending on the type of disability, there are many specific issues that would affect one’s work/life 
balance. For example, disabilities might require a round-the-clock caregiver, frequent hospitalizations, or frequent

6. Conclusion 
From this study, we will hopefully see that the work-life balance is a lot more entailed when a special needs child is 
involved. Employees with special needs child need to know what specific work-life balance programs they need to be 
able to work. They can do this by understanding what extra hardships are in their lives, and by being realistic at what 
stage they are at in life. A lot of these decisions will revolve around the type of special needs child they have. 
Employees will also need to understand that companies will not always offer those programs, so it is important to 
evaluate everything and make clear distinctions between needs and wants.  
 
On the other hand, employers need to know just what their expectations of their employees are, so that they will know 
if the employee is reaching them. They also need to know what time and effort they are willing to put into establish 
work-life balance programs, and which programs fit well with company policies and are beneficial to the company. 
Employers will see that while it might take extra work-life balance effort to hire a parent of a special needs child, it 
can still be beneficial and the employee can still have maximum performance in the company. 
 
The purpose of this paper was to show that establishing a work-life balance, especially among working parents with 
special needs children, is essential to both the health and production of a company. Successful organization are those 
that understand the hardships faced by parents of special needs children, create programs that help their employees 
attain balance between work and life, and understand their employees’ needs at different stages of their lives.  
  
6.1. Recommendations 
Our study solely focused on the Work-Life Balance of Parents with Special Needs Children, and did not include any 
comparison group (e.g., parents with typical children). Prior research in this field suggested that the experiences of 
these employed parents are distinctively different from employed parents of typically developing children; particularly 
in their ability to find appropriate child care. However, it would be beneficial to compare the demands, resources, and 
strain outcomes of working parents with special needs children to working parents caring for a typical child. 
 
The sample encompassed a diverse group of working parents caring for children with special needs. We interviewed 
parents through support groups in Bengaluru Karnataka. However, this method of recruitment meant that any parent 
who are not associated to these support groups (or who choose not to be part with them) were not included in this 
study, thus restricting the range of types of parents we sampled. 
 
Considering the geographical location surveyed and the number of parents available in that location, this result is 
derived. Thus, the results might get changed based on different location and the increase sample size.  
Also, the data for this study was gathered using only a self-report survey questionnaire, which may lead to Mono-
Method Bias. Mono-method bias may have inflated the strength of the observed relationships among demands, role-
specific strain, between-role strain and resources. So, in this context proposed future improvement is, data should be 
gathered through multiple sources (e.g., from both parents, observation, location etc.)

Abstract 
In recent years, customer engagement has gained significance due to the rapid growth of the Internet in the last few 
decades, which has offered enormous opportunities to customers. The purpose of the study is to assess the effect of 
social media marketing activities on customer engagement in social media brand communities. In addition, the study 
also examines the related outcomes of customer engagement in social media brand communities. Data were 
collected using a structured questionnaire from 159 social media users who follow particular brands on social media 
or were members of brand pages on social media. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling in Amos 
22.0. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that social media marketing activities significantly affect 
customer engagement in virtual brand communities. Moreover, customer engagement stimulates brand loyalty and 
consumers' intention to repurchase the brands promoted using social media platforms. Also,customer engagement 
positively influences consumers' willingness to pay a premium for the said brand. Social media has provided 
marketers a new opportunity to connect with existing and prospective customers and collect insights about the 
customers through interaction in social media brand communities. The marketers can utilize these customer insights 
in policy formulation and strategic decision-making. Therefore, this study will help brand managers boost customer 
engagement on the social media brand community pages.To the best of our knowledge, this study is a novel attempt 
to conceptualize the effect of social media market tingon customer engagement. It also provides valuable insights to 
the marketers on envisioning the related outcomes of customer engagement, i.e., brand loyalty, repurchase intention, 
and willingness to pay a premium to increase their brand community engagement.

Abstract 
Digital transformation is disrupting manufacturing, business, and almost every field. It is imperative for all 
organizations to transform to be relevant in the competition. Digital transformation is not a piece of software 
technology that we can buy, plug in and it will work. As pointed out by scholars and industry practitioners, 
transformation is a continuous journey, and to be successful, we need to identify critical elements of 
transformation and success factors and work on it. While there are several factors, when organizations are 
transforming, human resource and HRM plays a critical role. Implementing digital transformation without 
considering the people factor will be the disastrous approach. This research aims to determine the effect of 
human resource factors and HR management on the organization’s digital transformation. Using MS Excel, 
Regression analysis was carried out. Researcher has found a strong connection between organization digital 
transformation and human resource management factors.

1. Introduction
Digital transformation has caused disruption and a tsunami of uncertainties in the business world across the 
globe (Kontić and Vidicki 2018; Albukhitan 2020). Plenty of organizations perish as they fail to compete in the 
digital era. Bankruptcy of the movie-rental company Blockbuster and the selling of the Washington Post to 
Amazon are good examples that demonstrate the negative impact of not transforming. Simultaneously, digital 
transformation offers enormous opportunities and benefits to companies and leaders who act fast. 
Digitaltransformation is opening new technology and business horizons (Schaede 2020). Transformation is vital 
for the survival and success of industries and businesses (Ramnarayan and Mehta 2020). Digital transformation 
is a top priority in a CEO’s strategic planning list. 
The current situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic has created a destructive effect on the economy of the 
entire world, but it is acting as a catalyst for digital transformation. Presently, every company globally started 
thinking about digital transformation and the various ways to engage its customers through digital 
communication (Twilio 2020). Covid-19 forced leaders to think about remote engineering, usage of digital 
technologies, the safety of resources, and limitations (Jeff 2020). Yet transformation is not an easy task, a 
staggering 70% of digital transformation initiatives have failed (Saldanha 2019). All companies and executives 
know how crucial it is to evolve with technology and create digital processes and solutions but developing and 
managing the strategy is a different story (Blake 2019). Hence question is how to embrace the transformation 
and position it as a competitive advantage (Hess et al. 2016; Van der Zande 2018). Blake (2019) revealed in a 
publication that even though companies like GE and Ford failed in their transformation effort initially, they 
managed to adjust their strategy and succeed at a later stage. Narayana and Mehta (2020), further detail the 
digital transformation success stories of L&T, Symphony and kelvein keith. 
There is no doubt that technical aspects are more important, but even more complex problems can be resolved 
with competent resources either internally or by using external resources. There are several success factors 
pertaining to digital transformation. This article will focus on aspects of people and Human Resource 
Management (HRM). Research will focus on people and human resource management factors in the successful 
implementation of digital transformation. 
The success of the digital transformation depends on the employees working for it and their management. 
Organizations and their leaders must incorporate innovative HRM by monitoring the employee’s digital skills,

Abstract 
Structural components are known to fail through the growth of a fatigue crack. One effective way to repair a 
component is by bonding fiber composite patches. In this study a pre-cracked Aluminium skin 6061-T6 of one mm 
thin plate is repaired by symmetrically bonding patches of fiber reinforced polymer. The repair is simulated through 
numerical investigations to compare the performance of Unidirectional Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (UD-CFRP) 
patched specimen with that of Uni-directional Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (UD-GFRP) patched specimen for the 
same stiffness ratio (S) and the same fiber volume fraction ( 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓).  The J-integral for the max and mini stress of fatigue 
load is calculated by finite element analysis in Ansys-15. The maximum stress intensity factor (𝐾𝐾𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ) and minimum 
SIF (𝐾𝐾𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ) are calculated from the relation between J-Integral and SIF for various crack lengths.  Then the Paris law 
is invoked using the relation between ΔK and the crack length (a) to determine the crack length versus fatigue cycles. 
The comparison of the results of UD-CFRP and UD-GFRP specimens shows that the UD-GFRP patched specimen 
achieves marginally better performance. However, UD-CFRP patches were much thinner.

1. Introduction
Most of the structural components under dynamic loading are susceptible to fatigue failure. The structural components 
used in structural components are subjected to time-varying cyclic loads that fail through the fracture, rather than 
yielding at a stress value below the yield or ultimate strength of materials. Such a failure of components under 
fluctuating loads is known as fatigue failure. Fatigue failure is characterized by crack initiation and propagation of 
crack until it becomes unstable. Once the crack becomes unstable the catastrophic failure of components may occur. 
Hence many structural components require a substantial amount of inspection and defect monitoring at regular 
intervals. 
There are two ways available to deal with cracks when they are found in a structural component so that the weakened 
structure can regain its strength. 
1) repairing of the damaged component or
2) replacing the damaged component.

Using fatigue cycles data; a semi-log plot showing the number of fatigue cycles (N) vs. crack length (a)was plotted. 
Figure 7 presents 𝑎𝑎 vs. N plot, it is observed in graph that number of fatigue cycles for UD-GFRP is marginal higher 
than UD-CFRP for10 to 17 mm in length, crack. The fatigue cycles numbers at 17 mm for symmetrical UD-GFRP 
patch repaired specimen has 4.56 % more number of fatigue cycles compared to symmetrical UD-CFRP repaired 
patch specimen.

6. Conclusion
A thin centered pre-crack skin of aluminium 6061-T6 is repaired using symmetrical UD-CFRP specimen and 
symmetrical UD-GFRP patch specimen. The stiffness ratio as well as volume fraction have been kept constant. The 
stress intensity factor of both specimen under fatigue load were found to be marginally same in the numerical 
simulation. Fatigue life of UD-GFRP of GFRP patch specimen was found to be 4.56 % higher than that of UD-CFRP

Thus repair through CFRP patch is recommended for repair of skin were weight of the patch and thickness of the 
patch is required to be small.

Abstract 
The combustion characteristics, performance, and emission analysis of a single cylinder compression ignition engine 
are investigated in this paper using GT-Power software.  For result analysis four cases of engine rotation are 
considered here in this study such as 2400,3000,3600,4000 RPM. Inlet and outlet conditions are assumed to be same 
for modelling. The input values of pressure and temperature at inlet conditions have been assumed as output values 
from the turbocharger because this engine model is designed as a turbocharger-less model. Fuel mass injection, start 
of injection, start of combustion, injection timing, combustion duration, and mass fraction burned in premixed and 
diffusion combustion had taken as a fixed value. Different sub-models such as inlet environment, intake runner, 
intake port, inlet valve, fuel injection, cylinder, crank train, outlet environment, exhaust valve, port and runner are 
connected together for analysis. Some parameters are taken from GT-suite template library. After modelling 
simulation run for 10 cylces and the results obtained are, if the rpm goes on increasing the cylinder pressure, 
cumulative heat release rate, engine torque, Brake power, brake mean effective pressure, concentration of NOx in 
ppm increases and hydrogen concentration and CO concentration in ppm decreases.

1. Introduction
Diesel engine is also known as compression ignition engine (CI Engine) has wide application in the automobile, 
agricultural, industrial and transportation sectors due to its  suitable properties such as reliability, low cost, high 
thermal efficiency, no need of spark plug to start the ignition of the fuel, no require throttle control to supply air to 
engine, load control is possible by varying fuel injection, high density of fuel gives more energy per gallon, no 
pumping losses, heterogeneous combustion in diesel engine provide lean air fuel ratio etc. Emission of harmful 
gases is the major challenge in diesel engine due to this researcher try to find alternate fuel Springer (2022). 
Diesel fuel in CI Engines is useful due to ignition take place without the spark. Because of the higher efficiency of 
CI Engines compare to SI Engines makes them desirable to use in transportation even though increased prices. 
Combustion of diesel fuel in CI Engine emits some harmful gases such as, (HC) hydrocarbons, (PM) particulate 
matter, (NOx) nitrogen oxides, and (CO) carbon monoxide which affect the environmental pollution. Out of these 
emissions black smoke and (NOx) oxides of nitrogen are harmful and disgusting. Worldwide research is going on to

Figure 15. HC Concentration in ppm- Engine speed [RPM] 
 
Figure 15. Shows the reduction of HC concentration along with increased engine speed this was happen due to 
complete combustion of fuel inside the engine. In diesel engine maximum HC concentration emits at low load and 
low engine rpm due to incomplete combustion of the fuel inside the cylinder. At low load and rpm engine run at lean 
air –fuel mixing conditions due to this required oxygen is not getting for combustion of total fuel. 
 
6. Conclusion  
GT-Power software is a powerful simulation tool for combustion, performance, and emission analysis, according to 
the findings of this study. The engine's performance is observed to be low at low speeds and vice versa. In 
comparison to a high-speed engine, low-speed emissions were higher. Effects of injection timing, fuel injection 
mass, premixed and diffusion fuel mixing fraction can be observed by using this software. The perfect inputs given

in the simulation will lead to perfect results. This single cylinder CI Engine model is validated for further research 
on utilization of alcoholic fuel in CI engine. After research observed that the validated model will suitable for future 
research.

Abstract 
Okra (Abelmoschus Esculentus) is perishable in nature and its variable prices as well as arrivals depend on the 
supply and demand in the market. Approximately 73% of worldwide Okra is cultivated in India. This research 
incorporates seasonal variation in the forecasting of arrivals and three categories of prices, which were de-
seasonalized to achieve a regression line. Initial values of level, trend and seasonality were exploited from the 
regression line and were used to perform static time series forecasting analysis. The same initial values were then 
updated for every new data entry for the adaptive time series forecasting model (Winters Model). The errors and fit 
of model were seen on the basis of MSE, MAD, MAPE and R2 values. A database for the arrivals as well as the 
maximum, minimum and modal prices of Okra was gathered for 12 years (Jan’10 to Dec’21). The static model gave 
a MAPE of about 19.33% for the prices and almost 207% for arrivals of Okra. On the other hand, the adaptive 
winter’s model, which incorporated the previous as well as the current data, streamlining itself after every new 
entry, gave an average error of 13.9% for the prices and about 18.9% for arrivals. This adaptive model predicted the 
modal price of Jan 2022 and Feb 2022 to be Rs. 5800/quintal and Rs. 5600/quintal, and the actual values observed 
are Rs. 5700/quintal and Rs. 5200/quintal.

1. Introduction
India is known for the producing numerous fruits, dairy products, spices, meat, vegetables, fibrous crops like jute 
and is also among the top five agricultural producers in the world. The vast geographical region of India allows for 
the production of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables owing to the different temperature conditions. India 
accounted for almost 14% of global production of fruits and vegetables in 2021 (Apeda.gov report, FY 2022). Okra, 
commonly known as Ladyfinger or Bhindi, comes under the Malvaceae family and the genus Abelmoschus. India 
produced 58207.8 thousand quintals of okra annually in financial year 2022, accounting for 74 percent of global 
production whereas Gujarat's data for okra in FY-22 was reported at 9248 thousand quintals (NHB reports, 2022). 
The crop can be sown in all kinds of soils in between January-March and June- August. Reddy et al. (2018) 
mentioned that high fluctuations from season to season, is a reason why farmers do not always capitalize on the best 
price for the crop. One of the most critical prerequisites for boosting Supply Chain efficacy is demand prediction. 
Vegetables are not gathered from the farmers in some months due to a lack of market demand. During other times 
produce is unavailable for various causes, resulting in price increases (Rais and Sheoran 2015). Even Zhang et al. 
(2014) described how accurate forecasting of agricultural products can be useful for developing a proper balance 
between supply and demand.

4. Conclusion and Future work 
4.1 Conclusion 
There is a high need to apply the concepts and methodologies of supply chain management to the agricultural sector 
to reduce the wastage of food and other resources. Most of the products in this sector are perishable and there is a 
need to anticipate the needs and plan accordingly well in advance. On analysing the data available, it was observed 
that there was seasonality present which repeated itself every year. The static model and adaptive winter’s model 
were used to analyse and forecast the data of okra productions and prices. The errors and fit of model were seen on 
the basis of MSE, MAD, MAPE and R2 values. 
 
 The Static model gave a mean absolute error of about 19.33% for the prices and almost 207% for arrivals of Okra. 
This huge difference is because of the COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted the supply chains in every sector. On 
the other hand, the adaptive winter’s model, which incorporates the previous as well as the current data and updates 
itself after every new entry, gave an error of 13.9% for the prices and about 18.9% for arrivals. This adaptive model 
predicted the modal price of Jan 2022 and Feb 2022 to be Rs. 5800/quintal and Rs. 5600/quintal, and the actual 
values observed from were Rs. 5700/quintal and Rs. 5200/quintal.

4.2 Proposed Improvements/ Future work 
In this report we have used 2 main methods for forecasting. There are many more such methods which can be tested 
such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Artificial neural network and other machine learning algorithms. Here complete data for 
year 2020 is considered because the market is still recovering from Covid-19 but over the next 5-6 years when the 
economy has been fully recovered, covid-19 related data of the year 2020 can be omitted as it will be an outlier in 
the database.

Abstract 
Industrial Automation companies or IA companies played a critical role in Industry 3.0 transformation of 
manufacturing and process industries. Between 1980 and 2000, IA companies like ABB, Emerson, Honeywell, 
Rockwell, Siemens, and Yokogawa dominated with several measurements and digital control systems. Introduction 
of new technologies like Internet of things (IOT), Big Data, Virtua and augmented reality and data science, the 
industry 4.0 concept has changed the expectation of manufacturing and process industry customers. Industries are 
looking beyond traditional control systems, and the field is experiencing new competition from data-driven 
companies and consultants like Accenture, IBM, and TCS. IA companies are under pressure of two-fold digital 
transformation; one is internal operation transformation and the second is to enable the transformation of 
manufacturing and process industries. This research will holistically study the impact of digital transformation on IA 
companies and suggest the action fields to remain competent in the market.

1. Introduction
Digital transformation is making radical changes in the business processes, manufacturing industries and in social 
networking. Digital transformation is essential for the industries and businesses to remain competitive. Digital 
transformation provides opportunities and challenges to employees, organizations, and entire societies (Setia et al. 
2013; Bharadwaj et al. 2013; Dabrowska et al. 2022). Utilization of software and tools like, cloud migration, digital 
twins, big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) could lead to 
process and resource optimization and increased return on investment (ROI) for the business (Dabrowska et al. 
2022). 
Digital transformation is reshaping our work culture, and workplace (Marsh et al. 2021). As a result of revolving 
technology customer expectations and behaviors are changing (Manyika et al. 2013; Coad et al. 2021). Leaders need 
to create the business models with customer value creation and market capture in  mind (Nambisan 2017; Song 2019; 
Lanzolla et al. 2020). 
Digitalization is not a new concept for industrial automation companies; these companies started classical 
automation in 1970. Digital technology is continuously evolving in IA companies and at current focus is on 
developing the intelligent production process or “Industry 4.0” system (Horwart et al. 2018; Oesterreich  
and Teuteberg 2016; Brettel et al.2014; Horwart et al. 2019) 
In the industrial automation, ABB, Emerson, GE Automation, Honeywell, Siemens and Yokogawa, are considered 
big players. There are many other small and medium-sized automation companies. All these IA companies are 
impacted by digital transformation (Hess et al. 2016). IA companies require a strategy for internal transformation to 
improve productivity and enabler of customer (manufacturing companies) digital transformation to create a value 
proposition. 
IA companies dominated Industry 3.0 era between 1980~2010 by supplying control automation to manufacturing 
companies. Distributed control systems (DCS), programmable logic controllers (PLC), supervisory control and data 
acquisition system (SCADA) and other systems helped process industries to optimize the work, increase productivity 
and flourish the business. Industry 4.0 (Piccarozzi et al. 2018), which started in early 2010 and digital transformation 
changed the trends and IA companies are challenged by new technologies. New technology trends like the Internet of

6. Conclusion 
Industry Practitioners had varying views regarding the impact of Digital Transformation on IA Companies. 
Professionals beileve that there is tough competition due to IT player entry to the IA domain. If implemented with 
right vision and strategy transformation will open new business domains, enhances customer experience, and 
optimize the engineering, manufacturing, and other business processes. 
 
In response to the challenges of digital transformation, plugging some digital tools and software will not help for 
holistic growth of the organizations; however a strategic management framework including strategy formulation to 
execution and control is required. Impact analysis presented in this article is one step in this direction. However, 
more research and practice are needed. As study covered just six executives’ there is an opportunity for further 
investigation for more insight from all stakeholders. This research will continue to work on the action fields and 
success factors to implement digital transformation in IA companies.

Abstract 
Standard work is an effective method for the continuous improvement of manufacturing systems. It is a useful tool to 
document the most efficient method to create a product or service and describes how tasks are executed consistently 
by anyone. Standard work helps to maintain the quality, provides efficient operations, and ensures the proper use of 
tools and equipment. It finds application in various organizations to manage their tasks effectively and 
efficiently. Standard Work helps to train employees to identify and eliminate non-value-added activities such as 
unnecessary motion, waiting, and defects, thus significantly reducing the time to complete the task. Standard work 
acts as a diagnostic tool, by exposing the issues and promoting continuous improvement. Even though this is a very 
helpful tool, it is often overlooked and underutilized. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of this 
Lean Manufacturing tool. In this paper, a lifecycle management project in the healthcare sector is used as an example 
of application. The Healthcare sector consists of various critical manufacturing processes and defects that require 
critical attention and quick solutions. The main findings are, that lead time can be decreased by approximately 22-
25% with the implementation of Standard work and is effectively a good tool to train the employees easily and to 
normalize the work procedures with increased flexibility and production, and decreased waste, errors, and lead time.

1. Introduction
Any of the healthcare industry, which is leading in the marketplace today, understands the significance of basic 
standards, what is acceptable and what is not acceptable in quality of service, safety of patient, policies for employees, 
etc. Standard work characterizes such an organization, in both its management activities and daily operations. The 
standardization-practicing organisation has systems in place for developing standards and the standard work, 
conveying them clearly, adhering and maintaining to them, and supporting their continuous improvement. Standard 
work is critical in healthcare operations for reducing waste, maintaining patient’s safety, optimising flow, attaining 
balanced and synchronous healthcare service production (Thomas 2012). 
We spend a lot of time in healthcare debating which norm to follow since there are many instances where ""expert 
opinion"" reigns supreme, and everyone is an expert. It's significantly more necessary to agree on standard practise 
first, then follow it and enhance it. A standard is an example or a rule that sets clear expectations. Continuous 
improvement method depends on setting, improving and identifying the standards. Without any initial standard, we 
can’t measure the effectiveness of the improvement to achieve a standard, we can’t improve the standard, we can’t set 
additional goals and can’t achieve the goals. Standards are foundation of all improvements, and new standards defines 
the revolutionary goals you pursue to achieve the continuous improvement (Shingo 1989).

Percentage reduction in time to complete the project= 23.57% 
By eliminating waste like waiting times, searches, and information corrections that result in rework, both in the project 
area and later in manufacturing, the application of standardisation in product development also significantly reduces 
lead time. With the calculations it is found that there is 23.57% reduction in lead time to complete the project. 
4. Conclusion
When used properly, seemingly basic methods can occasionally result in significant breakthroughs at cheaper prices. 
Lean production's central tenet, which encourages making more with less, is taken into account when implementing 
the standard job. Because of this, the corporation need not make a significant investment. The company now has a 
foundation for documenting the numerous project-related procedures thanks to the standardisation of the processes 
through Standard work. These documents are crucial for giving staff more flexibility, as well as for boosting 
productivity and reducing variability to the point where they can reduce a variety of wastes and manufacturing failures. 
Thus the advantages of applying Standard Work proved to be: 
•
Train employees easily
•
Reduce lead time
•
Reduce variability in process
•
Better control on project processes
•
Reduce rework
Standard Work is useful for simply documenting the Project procedures contained in projects. It is more interactive 
and simpler to grasp when typical work is documented using a SIPOC (Supplier, Input, Process, Output, Customer) 
diagram and a process flow chart with swimlanes. Employees can quickly comprehend the project process by 
standardising the job instead of constantly asking someone who is familiar with the procedure for assistance. By 
employing standard work, waste and rework can be decreased. Because there can be no improvement without a 
standard, standard work can be utilised as a tool for ongoing improvement.

Abstract 
In manufacturing systems, facility layout design has an importance as it helps to improve the productivity of layout, 
influences manufacturing costs, WIP and lead times. The current work aims to enhance the productivity of engine 
cylinder block line and achieving the increased demand by design of mixed product production line. Two production 
line has been considered for present work. After the detailed analysis of every activity at each workstation, merging 
of both production line has been done and new workstation sequence and proposed cycle time for each workstation 
has been evaluated. The Yamazumi chart is used to compare the average proposed cycle time at each workstation 
and the new takt time for balancing the line. New layout established the possibility of reducing the manpower and 
number of workstations for new demand. New layout is analyzed by using Witness simulation software which 
helped to determine the operators and workstations idle and busy time. Simulation results of new layout brought 
about reduction in manpower and reduction in idle time of operator. The proposed new layout demonstrates an 
increase in yield and productivity compared to the current layout.

1. Introduction
Industries are always in search of various strategies in order to gain a competitive advantage and have to conceive 
and implement new strategies which give them the advantages such as flexibility, quick response, low cost, 
efficiency, quality, reliability and service. Enterprises must constantly enhance the underlying business and 
production process to be competitive. Production layout plays an important role in manufacturing industry. The 
performance of a production line is strongly affected by different layout configurations. A good layout design can 
help you make better use of resources including equipment, materials, space, and labor, as well as reduce inventory 
and setup time. Changing a layout design is an expensive and long-term endeavor. Any change or rearrangement of 
an existing layout incurs a significant cost in terms of both relocation and processing time. As a result, modifying 
the layout design cannot be done directly. 
This study involved design of new mixed product production layout by combining the two lines at automobile 
industry. The goal of this study is to identify the current state of both line by doing detailed study of every operation 
and collecting all the necessary data useful for designing new improved proposed layout for not only improving the 
productivity but also optimizing the layout. 
2. Literature Review
To get the maximum benefits companies always try to increase their productivity. Work study can be used for 
manufacturing unit to enhance productivity (Bargi and Raushan 2014). Work study consist of method study in which 
we can find most effective method of performing job and work measurement helps to determine the time required by 
operator for doing an operation on job at defined level of performance (Biswas et. al. 2016). There are other many

5.2 Comparisons 
For comparison of existing and proposed line three performance measures has been considered and comparison has 
been done by considering the 20 blocks per day demand for both existing and proposed layout. For that purpose, 
number of head counts and workstations required for existing line for 20 block per day demand is calculated. If the 
suggested layout is implemented for the 20 blocks per day of demand, comparison Table 7 reveals significant 
headcount savings 43 percent and 37 percent reduction in floor space requirement due to the need for 8 fewer 
workstations than the current layout.

Abstract 
Scheduling is a persistent problem in manufacturing systems and is considered one of the most challenging 
combinatorial problems. The scheduling problem of flexible job shops where operations are scheduled on the 
available flexible machines is commonly referred to as FJSP and is considered as an important scheduling problem 
due to its nearness to advanced manufacturing systems. During production, the achines need setup for processing 
two different jobs consecutively. Such setup time is called sequence-dependent setup time (SDST). This paper 
presents a decentralized multi-agent-based model for the FJSP-SDST. For optimization, a popular swarm-based 
algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), is embedded with the multi-agent model to achieve a global solution. 
An illustrative example has been explained along with the computational results for the ten standard test cases to 
show the effectiveness and robustness of the approach.

1. Introduction
A flexible job shop is a manufacturing system where a variety of jobs can be processed by flexible machines. 
Scheduling problems, considered in the flexible job shop, are often known as the Flexible Job-shop Scheduling 
Problem (FJSP). FJSP has attracted the attention of researchers due to its closeness to real-world manufacturing 
systems (Mokhtari et al., 2015). For solving FJSP, two sub-problems, machine assignment and operation 
sequencing, are generally solved. Along with these, investigations are also carried out to solve FJSP with various 
constraints. maintenance planning, transportation and setup time(Gao et al. 2006; Li et al. 2020, 2013; Li and Gao 
2016; Nouri et al. 2016; Wang and Yu 2010; Hu et al. 2020). The setup time is needed to make a machine or 
resource ready for the processing of the job. However, the setup time soften dependent on the previous job 
processed on the machine. Such setup time is called as sequence-dependent setup time (SDST). 
For solving the FJSP-SDST, two solution approaches, exact and approximate algorithms, have been applied. The 
exact algorithms, however, are not suitable for large real-life problems owing to the NP-Hard nature of FJSP. Thus, 
the approximate algorithms have been applied more often for the FJSP-SDST. These approaches are hybrid Genetic 
Algorithm (GA) (Wang and Zhu 2021), Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)(Li and Lei 2021a), self-adaptive 
evolutionary algorithm(Azzouz, Ennigrou and Said 2017)and Tabu Search (TS) (Abdelmaguid 2015), Iterated local 
search (ILS) (Mousakhani 2013). The above algorithms have been applied with a centralized decision-making 
approach. The centralized decision-making approach works on controlling decisions centrally, limiting the 
flexibility and scalability to solve complex combinatorial problems such as FJSP. Instead, decentralized approaches, 
such as multiagent systems (MAS), are more suitable for solving such issues due to their ability to simplify complex 
problems through disintegration(Barbati et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2019). The agents in MAS are allocated different 
tasks which cooperate/compete with other agents to fulfil their objectives. In literature, different MAS have been

6. Conclusion 
This paper has addressed the FJSP with sequence dependent setup time (SDST) with an objective to minimize the 
makespan. The decentralized multi agent-based model is presented to solve the FJSP-SDST. The approach consists 
of three agents: coordinator agent, job agents and machine agents. These agents are employed with auction strategy 
to solve the two sub-problems of operation sequencing and machine selection along with fulfilling the SDST 
constraint. To perform global search, the multi-agent system is embedded with optimization algorithm Particle 
swarm optimization (PSO) to achieve minimization of Makespan. An illustrative example is solved. The 
performance of the algorithm is compared with benchmark algorithms by solving ten standard benchmark instances. 
The results are competitive for small problems and are much better for large problems. This approach shows the 
effectiveness of decentralized approach to solve complex problems of FJSP. In future works, the proposed 
decentralized algorithm will be applied on the other standard benchmark instances for testing the large problem size 
with multiple objectives and constraints.

Abstract 
Condition monitoring of the system is important, historical data is available for the system but we cannot always 
depend on it for near-net prediction of system failure.  In this paper, oil properties analysis and ferrography analysis 
is used to maintain and extend the life of the system. Due to sliding motion in the case of a single-speed worm 
gearbox temperature increases and it leads to a decrease in the performance of oil properties. As result, the overall 
performance of the gearbox gets affected. In oil property analysis, response parameters like viscosity index, and 
TAN  are analyzed, whereas Direct reading ferrography offers parameters like large particle count and small particle 
count, Wear Severity Index, and Wear Particle Concentration. Analytical ferrography gives us morphology related 
to wear particles. Microscopic examination of wear particles helps to find out the type of wear and source of wear. 
As per industrial application, the speed of the gearbox, the geometry of gear pairs, the material of gears, and oil 
level, the type of lubricating oil and load on the gearbox determines the process input parameters. On the basis of the 
required process parameters, an experimental setup using a single-speed worm gearbox is developed. Oil 
examination is carried out at fixed time intervals for recording response parameters. The oil samples obtained by 
experimentation can be examined through oil properties analysis and ferrography analysis. The current study 
includes formulating relation of oil properties to the wear of gear pairs to make a condition-based maintenance 
policy to maintain and extend the life of the gearbox.

Ferrography, oil properties analysis, worm gearbox, Bio chromatic microscope and condition monitoring. 
1. Introduction
study of wear, friction, and lubrication of surfaces that are in relative motion comes under the concept of tribology. 
Maintenance of the tribomechanical system depends on friction, wear, and lubrication. About 90 % of savings can 
be achieved through maintenance is possible with the help of the tribological approach. Wear of any system is 
unavoidable but keeping track is possible. There are various techniques used for condition monitoring of the system 
such as vibration analysis, spectroscopic analysis, etc. but this technique cannot tell about the actual type of wear, 
source of wear and change in oil properties. In this paper, ferrography and oil properties analysis is used to check the 
condition of the gearbox. To avoid sudden failure of the system it is requisite to monitor a viscosity index of oil, 
TAN, increasing WPC, and wear trend to prevent the sudden breakdown of the system.  
Condition monitoring helps to find out how a change in oil properties impact the life of worm gearbox and overall 
performance of worm gearbox. Also it is useful to establish the relation of oil properties analysis with ferrography 
analysis to make a better condition based maintenance policy. 
From an industrial application point of view, e.g., small machinery, escalators, conveyors, packaging equipment, etc. 
normally a worm and worm gearbox is used. It normally works in all three shifts per day. When there is power 
transmission from the input shaft to the output shaft in the gearbox, there is a sliding motion between the gear pair

of oil filtration in the system wear rate is more on that span. Overall direct reading ferrography shows there is 
continuous increase in wear because of oil degradation. 
6. Conclusion
In this study, constant speed and load are applied to the single-speed worm gearbox system. Oil properties analysis 
and ferrography analysis have been used to investigate the condition of a single-speed worm gearbox under the 
normal operating condition. Oil properties analysis provides viscosity index and TAN No. which shows the viscosity 
of oil decreases with degradation of oil, and an increase in TAN leads to corrosion. Ferrography analysis provided 
wear rate, oil condition, type of wear mechanism, and source of wear.  
In the case of oil properties analysis, kinematic viscosity goes on decreasing with time and TAN No. increases with 
time. the wear rate is low initially and it goes on increasing with time. Correlating these two condition monitoring 
techniques resulted in the comprehensive diagnosis of the operating condition of the worm gearbox. Because they 
are dependent on each other.  As no. of running hours are increasing degradation of oil also increases,  
change in oil properties depends on the number of running hours and wear rate depends on the change in oil 
properties. It is seen that process parameter with no. of running hour cause a change in oil properties and a change in 
oil properties causes an increase in wear. From this study, we can conclude that change in oil properties impacts on 
wear of the gearbox which shows that both are the function of gearbox running hours. 
A combination of oil properties analysis and ferrography analysis is very useful to find out the source of the problem 
if arises and to take corrective action as well as to make the condition-based maintenance policy to maintain and 
extend the life of the system.

Abstract 
In this study, the tribological behavior of EN24 steel and oil hardened non-shrinking steel (OHNS) is investigated. 
Experimentation is performed using a pin-on-disc wear test setup. EN24 is used as pin material and OHNS as disc. 
Samples of pin are performed under wet sliding conditions at ambient temperatures. Sliding speed, load, and time are 
input parameters, while frictional force, friction coefficient and wear are the output parameters. Wear losses and worn-
out surfaces are measured using an electronic balance and an optical microscope. By introducing oils between the pin 
and disc, lubricant enhances the system performance which is measured. Ferrography is used for figuring out how 
many and what kind of wear particles are in lubricating oil. Surface investigations were carried out using SEM and 
EDS to understand the friction and wear behavior. Taguchi L9 is used for the design of experiments, and ANOVA is 
used for optimization. Most significant parameter observed is load as compared to sliding velocity and time in terms 
of frictional force and friction coefficient. For wear, load and sliding speed are significant factors.

1. Introduction
Wear is the main factor in the failure of components, which are widely used in the industries. Steels and alloys are 
used as the connecting rods, gear shafts, large cross section for aircrafts, crankshafts, gear shafts and landing gear 
components and some heavy forgings, like rotor shafts and discs. For performing the experimental study EN 24 alloy 
steel is used as pin as it has application in various industries. It is a medium carbon low alloy steel that includes several 
alloying elements including chromium, nickel, and molybdenum. This alloy steels major components, Mn, and Cr, 
provide it excellent strength and hardness.  The qualities such as strength, toughness, and hardenability are all 
enhanced by nickel, which also raises the hot hardness value and increases corrosion and wear resistance. Now, it is 
necessary to increase power, reduce maintenance, and better replacement method while also reducing the size of 
machine components. These demands put a lot of pressure on demand and design for other solutions. It would be 
extremely costly and time-consuming to test solutions on an entire machine. Therefore, prior to full-scale tests, 
tribological research is widely performed using the universal experimental set-ups (Baig et.al. 2021).  
The major source of energy loss, which lower the performance of mechanical systems, is the wear on sliding pairs. To 
determine the impact on EN24 steel, a pin-on-disc wear test is conducted. A fixed pin with an applied load in contact 
with a rotating disc which makes up a pin-on-disc wear test device. The sliding wear and friction characteristics of 
lubricated or dry surfaces made of a range of materials are measured by the pin-on-disc setup. On the pin-on-disc test 
setup, the standard load, rotational speed, sliding distance, and temperature all these parameters are available. 
Specimen with a 50 mm length and Conical heads are used with such pins because they are simple to position and 
provide the ideal region of contact with rotating discs.

In Figure 16 It was observed that when the speed increases frictional force is in between mean upto certain speed, 
after that it increases in certain amount. Frictional force continuously increased when load increased. Load is 
significant factor in terms of frictional force. Table 6 shows ANOVA for frictional force, and it has found that load is 
more significant as compared to speed and time.  
 
In Figure 17 It was observed that when the load increased, the coefficient of friction continuously decreased. This 
occurs because of a large accumulation of wear debris and lubricant in the contact zone that acted as a third body as 
the load increased. Therefore, three body abrasive wear processes were responsible for the decrease in friction 
coefficient. Table 7 shows ANOVA for coefficient of friction, in which pressure has significant effect. 
 
In Figure 18 As the load increased continuously wear also increased, for wear load is significant factor. As the speed 
increases at certain speed wear also increases after increases in higher speed wear is decreased in minor, this is because 
of the at higher speed it gets constant boundary condition of lubricating oil between pin and disc. From analysis of 
variance of wear load shows significant result as shown in table 8.   
 
6. Conclusion  
The main conclusions that are observed during the experiments are as follows. 
• 
Most significant parameter observed are load compared to speed and time in terms of frictional force and 
coefficient of friction. Load and speed are significant factors in terms of wear.  
• 
It is found that the coefficient of friction continuously reduced as the load increased. This is because when 
the load increased, a lot of wear debris gathered in the contact zone and mixed with lubricant, acting as a 
third body. Therefore, the decrease in friction coefficient was caused by three body abrasive wear 
mechanisms.

Abstract 
A supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific 
product/service to consumers. This network constitutes people, entities, information, activities, and resources. A 
supply chain disruption occurs when demand or supply spikes or falls unexpectedly, resulting in a massive 
imbalance between the two. As supply chains become more global, the risk of such interruptions has aggravated 
considerably. In fact, catastrophic occurrences have highlighted the importance of analyzing disruption risk and 
developing mitigation plans to deal with it. In this research, we use the simulation software Arena to model a supply 
chain and analyze the consequences of network disturbances. The present research seeks to assist an organization in 
determining its level of risk in terms of disruptions that compromise product availability. A discrete-event 
simulation model of a multi-echelon supply chain consisting of a retailer, a manufacturing plant maintaining an 
input and output buffer, and a supplier is developed. Disruptions are introduced at different echelons of the system, 
and the dependence of customer fill rate and the demand fill rate on disruption durations are investigated in detail. 
The research offers a detailed understanding of the consequences of disruptions by capturing both risk profiles and 
material flow. Mitigation strategies, namely, safety inventory (inventory control) and contingency strategies for 
backing up specific suppliers or links in the supply chain (sourcing), are examined in the present paper. Furthermore, 
the effect of these mitigation strategies on the customer service level is also analyzed. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
A supply chain is a network between organizations to produce and distribute a specific product/service to consumers. 
The global supply chains are now dipping into a vortex of disruptions primarily driven by socio-political, 
environmental and technological factors. For instance, supply chains across the globe faced a meltdown during the 
COVID-19 outbreak that is still looming large (Dohale et al., 2021). The ongoing conflict between Russia and 
Ukraine and the advent of disruptive technologies like the blockchain technology and artificial intelligence also pose 
significant operational challenges to the business process. In this milieu, it is essential to explore some of the less 
dissected issues plaguing supply chain performance in the industry. 
A supply chain disruption is an unusual spike or steep fall in demand or supply, leading to a massive imbalance 
between the two. These disruptions may occur mainly due to: inefficient response to technology trends, natural or 
environmental calamities and inaccurate planning and forecasting. When products do not reach customers on time, it

Figure 10. Demand fill rate vs Disruption inter-arrival time with and without Safety inventory 
It is found that an increase in the safety inventory at the retailer side also helps in increasing the customer service 
level. Ultimately, these analysis offers valuable insights for supply chain practitioners to understand the sensitivity 
of both customer and demand fill rates with respect to multiple parameters including disruption duration, lot size and 
the availability of backup facilities.  
5. Conclusion
It is observed that disruptions even at one segment of the supply chain system significantly impact the performance 
of the entire supply chain system. A disruption in the upstream can significantly affect all the downstream segments. 
Therefore, it is essential to focus on each supply chain segment while developing mitigation strategies. Investing in 
backup facilities throughout the supply chain network should be done to minimise disruption risks in the system. It 
is observed from the results that when the mean inter-arrival time of the disruptions increases, the demand fill rate 
also increases. As disruptions occur less frequently and the system has sufficient time to recover from the earlier 
disruption, the disruptions do not get cumulated. An increase in disruption durations decreases the demand fill rate 
since the longer disruption durations make the system more prone to disruptions getting cumulated which can lead to 
a high level of retailer lost sales. While considering different types of distributions for the disruption durations, it is 
observed that as the maximum parameter (D_MAX) and the minimum parameter (D_MIN) increase, the demand/ 
customer fill rate decreases since the disruption duration increases for all the considered disruption distributions. It is 
noted that the least fill rate occurs in the case of uniform distribution since each disruption duration has the same 
chance of occurring, including the maximum disruption duration considered. But in the case of both triangular and 
normal distributions, the chances of having the extreme disruption durations are least likely to occur. As a result, the 
most likely duration is close to the distribution's mean. This feature implies that a triangularly or normally 
distributed disruption is easier to handle than a uniformly distributed disruption duration. Furthermore, the presence 
of a backup production plant can tackle the type of disruptions having high disruption duration and low disruption 
frequency (disruptions with high inter-arrival time) more effectively. Therefore, this type of disruption can be 
tackled by introducing backup facilities at each supply chain echelon. However, this option may not always be 
financially feasible.  
Quantification of the risk associated while introducing disruptions can be studied in a more realistic manner in the 
simulation model. Extending the current simulation model to include multiple entities at each stage/segment of the 
supply chain is an area for further work. More mitigation strategies can be developed and tested. Future work can 
also focus on optimising various parameters by considering cost aspects in the modelled supply chain to maximise 
the performance of the supply chain using the OptQuest extension in Arena simulation software.

Abstract 
This paper studies the impact of socio demographic profile, social support, and government initiatives on 
entrepreneurial intention of home-based women entrepreneurs in Chennai. Data were collected from 15 
entrepreneurs through in depth semi structured interview using purposive sampling technique.  The interview 
questions mainly concentrated to extract the financial position, age, marital status, education, home ownership, 
household size, family support, business income, future plan and challenges influence the reason for choosing their 
entrepreneurship. Result suggests that financial independence, lack of employment opportunity, and freedom act as 
main motivators for choosing entrepreneurship. Results also indicate that women entrepreneurs are not aware of any 
government schemes which are introduced by the government for the development of Women entrepreneurs.

Abstract 
Inventory control is essentially a predominant decision to be undertaken by operations managers of a firm. A 
proper inventory control system ensures a sufficient amount of goods or materials to meet the firm's demand 
without facing undersupply or oversupply of materials. Traditionally, decision-makers classify inventory items 
into various classes or subgroups for easy monitoring and managing stock levels. The classification efficiency 
can be ameliorated by applying machine learning algorithms. The present paper focuses on developing a hybrid 
methodology that integrates machine learning algorithms with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to 
facilitate multi-attribute inventory analysis. This technique enables the operator to leverage the benefits of both 
ML and MCDM. The data set is initially classified using MCDMs like the Simple Additive weighted (SAW) 
method and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model. Performance 
metrics like overall cost and customer fill rate are utilized to rank the efficiency of the generated MCDM 
models. Supervised machine learning algorithms like Decision tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), XG boost and KNN are employed on the MCDM models, and the performance of the system is 
established in terms of the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm. In order to prevent the inventory model 
from inclining towards the majority class, upsampling of the dataset is undertaken. Analysing the results, it is 
concluded that the application of TOPSIS MCDM provides better results for the considered systems in both 
machine learning and non-machine learning performance indices.

1. Introduction
Inventory-related decision-making and reviewing of any firm should be accomplished judicially since these 
policies are vital for customer fulfilment (Hatefi et al., 2013). Inventory control methods ensure a sufficient 
quantity of stock is maintained by a firm, hence enabling customer fulfilment at minimal holding cost (Silver et 
al., 2017; Sridhar et al., 2021). For ease of inventory management, the inventory items are generally classified 
into different categories based on the significance to the overall process in the firm. This methodology facilitates 
the scope for targeted inventory review policies and management. For instance, in the case of the stock that is 
considered vital to the majority of the process of a firm, it is important that the stock availability is continuously 
reviewed, whereas the items that are not crucial may not require continuous review. Hence inventory 
classification enables easier monitoring.  
In the classical approach, the yearly monetary consumption value of the inventory items is the only factor in 
consideration whilst the classification. Later on, several works were conducted highlighting the significance of

When Decision tree is applied for SAW and TOPSIS, it is found that SAW has accuracy 81.5% while TOPSIS 
has 83% and when Random forest is applied for SAW and TOPSIS, it is found that SAW has accuracy 90% 
while TOPSIS has 89% and when Support Vector Machine is applied for SAW and TOPSIS, it is found that 
SAW has accuracy 85% while TOPSIS has 84.5% and when XGBoost is applied for SAW and TOPSIS, it is 
found that SAW has accuracy 88% while TOPSIS has 89.5% and when KNN is applied for SAW and TOPSIS it 
is found that SAW has accuracy 80% while TOPSIS has 81% are obtained. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A generic hybrid technique of multi-criteria decision-making models combined with machine learning methods 
for analysing multi-attribute inventory classification problems is presented in this research. Inventory classes 
were determined by employing two different MCDM approaches, TOPSIS and SAW. Following the 
classification, five machine learning algorithms, i.e., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support vector machine, 
XGboost, and KNN, were employed to anticipate the pre-identified classes of each classification method. After 
checking and eliminating outliers, the dataset has been divided into a training dataset and a testing dataset. Once 
the division is done, then evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1 score, and accuracy were 
obtained. After analysing the results, it is evident that TOPSIS is best MCDM technique for multi-criteria 
inventory classification situations in all aspects like the fill rate and overall cost when compared to SAW. 
Although the prediction of algorithms may not be exact in some circumstances, depending on the various data 
sets, owing to concerns with data distribution and measurement, the case study proved that all algorithms were 
able to categorize inventory items exceptionally effectively. It is commonly acknowledged in the field of 
machine learning that an imbalance distribution of ABC classes can affect classification accuracy; thus, an 
evenly distributed training set was created using random under-sampling methods before a different data set, 
which included a distribution with Pareto assumption.  
 
As previously stated in this study, accuracy alone is insufficient for comprehensively evaluating and comparing 
categorization systems. Further research using additional data sets and/or alternative machine learning 
algorithms, as well as multiple MCDM methodologies, can be employed to examine the extent to which the 
general hybrid methodology suggested in this work can efficiently categorize inventory items. Most importantly, 
the hybrid ML-MCDM methodology can be applied for inventory classification in a real-world situation 
involving thousands of inventory items.

Abstract 
Transformer is a device which helps in improvement of efficiency and safety of electrical power system by increasing 
or decreasing voltage levels whenever we needed. As transformer is very important electric device it is necessary to 
check health condition of transformer by checking various parameters of transformer like voltage, current, etc. so if 
there are any abnormal change in parameters of transformer, we can easily detect fault present in the transformer to 
avoid catastrophic effects. It is very tedious job to monitor transformer manually so there is necessity of monitoring 
transformer in real time. For monitoring transformer in real time, we are using IOT in which various sensors, raspberry 
pi is used for monitoring and along with this cloud computing is used. Cloud computing is technology which is used 
for storing and processing data from any computer. There are many different IOT applications that use the open-source 
platform known as ThingSpeak cloud. Cloud computing is the success of IOT technology. And we are going to add 
machine learning into this for detecting whether transformer is faulty or not by using various algorithm.

1. Introduction
Transformer is very essential device in day -to- day life. In every area of our city at least one transformer is present. 
Basically, transformer is used for stepping up and stepping down the voltage by using the different number of turns 
within the coil on secondary side. Since current and voltage are inversely correlated, when a stepup transformer is 
present, current falls and voltage increases when a step-down transformer is present. The failure rate of transformer in 
India is more than other developed countries. Instead of checking faults or finding the reason behind failure whole 
transformer is replaced. This automatically affects the economy of our country. Transformer is one of the main 
components of electricity and big part of investment of government. If a transformer is overloaded, heated by low or 
high voltage current, or both, its lifespan decreases, which can cause an unexpected breakdown and supply loss for a 
large number of customers, which has an impact on the dependability of the system. Causes of transformer includes 
various parameters like overheat, overload, oil leakage, damage seal, broken lead, etc. Transformer has capacity to 
supply consumers of low voltage with electricity. Consequently, the transformer's operational state is crucial to the 
distribution network. For a long life, the transformers must be used in rated condition. Transformer overloading and 
inadequate cooling might result in sudden failure, which can disrupt the delivery of energy to numerous users. The 
manual monitoring of changes in ambient temperature, load current, and voltage. becomes very crucial task. Causes of 
Transformer failure are as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 13.  Bar graph presenting accuracies of various algorithms 
As Figure 10-13 shows the comparison of accuracy levels of different algorithms. Among all algorithms Random 
Forest gives more accurate result. Even with the enormous dataset, it operates effectively and predicts the outcome 
with a high degree of accuracy. Hence, for fault prediction in transformer Random Forest algorithm is more useful. 
6. Conclusion
 The proposed technique with results has shown that the protection scheme works properly with accuracy, sensitivity 
of this scheme very high for the abnormal and faulty conditions. Transformer Health Monitoring will help to identify 
or recognize unexpected situations before any serious failure which leads to greater reliability and significant cost 
savings. If transformer is in abnormal condition we can know from anywhere. No human power need to monitor the 
transformer. Details about the transformer are automatically updated in webpage when the transformer is in abnormal 
condition. With the help of Machine Learning, prediction of faults can be done. Also, while monitoring parameters 
of transformer, the actual reason which caused the failure of transformer can be found. The data obtained from 
transformer will be useful for creating effective dataset. In future we can add more parameters of transformer and 
create more robust ML algorithm to predict the fault in transformer. We can get all information by placing the 
proposed system modules at every transformer. In future, the machine learning based approach for fault detection in 
the transformer will be presented. The input to the system would be voltage, current and temperature while output 
would be the classification of faulty or non-faulty system.

In today’s world the continuous requirement of Electrical supply from Electrical power system network is increased 
with huge demand of various loads. Most of the interacting elements with power system network causes disturbances 
by creating different types of faults. It is required to identification and classification of different types of faults in 
three phase system accurately. The faults generally provide the damage to the system with carrying huge amount of 
current and breakdown of insulation (Stevenson 1982). For reducing breakdown maintenance and revenue losses of 
industry it is require for accurate measurement of fault identification. For multiclass fault identification sometimes the 
low cost bi-metal relay, electromagnetic relay, static relay is not suitable (Bhalja and Maheshwari 2006). The general 
type of faults which will occurring on the transmission lines are like single line to ground fault, double line to ground 
fault, three phase faults. The faults which are occurring on transmission lines not only damage the equipment and 
effect the power quality. So that it is required to identify the fault before the damage of equipment. The voltage and 
current signals associated with numerical relay are operated based on signal conditioning like filtering, sampling 
depends on the components available in the relay systems (Sybille et al.2000).  
The three main parts of power system is generation, Transmission, and distribution of power to the various 
consumers. The major faults are generally existing in transmission lines. There is huge requirement for immediate 
fault detection for uninterruptable power transmission and distribution. For reliable power supply to the consumer, it 
is required to facilitate power system maintenance and protection against faults. The most practiced method is usinga

4. Conclusion 
The implementation of wavelet transform for classification and identification of faults in power systems has been 
discussed in this paper. The performance of wavelet transform with fault analysis mainly depends on its threshold 
value, but this value is not same for different power system networks, and it is required to determine separate 
threshold value for respective power system network. This drawback can be overcome by using Radial Basis 
Function neural network.  The analysis of RBFNN also presented in this paper.  The RBFNN will not depends on 
any threshold value for classification and identification of faults in the power system. The RBFNN is require large 
amount of input and output data for training and testing to get better accuracy.

Abstract 
 
Speed breakers or Hump has formed to reduce the accidents, but unfortunately excessive use of speed breakers in urban 
area / inner cities / metropolitan distracts vehicle drivers. In addition to that, most of time drivers cannot recognize the 
appearance of unmarked speed breakers and lose control of the vehicle, causing serious accidents and loss of lives. 
Especially in India speed breakers may not be visible to driver’s eye due to fade borders, having no cross lines to indicate, 
damaged road, less differentiation from road and so on due to poor maintenance, in this article we proposed a new approach 
to sort out identified problems using image processing techniques. As we seen the high severity is in night time most cases, 
we planned to developed algorithms to work on night time as driver may avoid / mitigate the critical situation in daytime. 
 
1. Introduction 
The speed bump detection system in a vehicle is used to detect speed bumps, humps, speed breaker on the roads and alert 
the driver or other components in the vehicle to apply appropriate action like brake, steer etc. The driver may miss to notice 
the speed humps in complex driving conditions especially during night time due to less / no lights. An un-noticed speed-
hump on high speed is harmful to passengers especially pregnant women and elderly people travelled in vehicle. It also 
leads to damage the tires and tubes and even may damages the vehicle also sometime. Usually, speed humps / breakers are 
built in places like school zone, accident-prone locations, sharp Turing, congested residential streets, unmanned level 
crossings where speed of the vehicle needs to controlled to avoid accidents. The speed humps will have various physical 
identities such as height, length of ramps, depth etc. However, most of time it is not followed in India. Most of the humps 
in India are not being constructed and maintained according to the public safety guidelines of Indian Road Congress (IRC) 
i.e., IRC099, which is resulting in severe discomfort to the driver and even causing loss of direction control which is leading 
to fatalities. 
 
According to the news published in Times of India on Sep 14, 2015, 14:42 IST, according to the Road Accident Report 
(2014) published by the road transport and highways ministry, while 4,726 lives were lost in crashes due to humps, 6,672 
people died in accidents caused due to potholes and speed breakers. 
 
1.1 Objective 
According to Indian roads, different types of Humps are placed in roads to slow down the vehicle speed and sometimes 
installed in a series of several humps to prevent cars from speeding. Here we have captured few types and decided to detect 
it all by proposed approach.","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

• 
Current algorithm may not perfectly fit for Day time, as this paper only focus on night 
time, upcoming version may solve this. 
• 
There should be improvisation on performances 
• 
Going forward approach may able to classify potholes also along with Hump 
 
9. Conclusion 
The idea of this paper is to detect hump to prevent or mitigate the collusion and vehicle damage by hitting 
on it. The proposed method has resolved the identified problem and been proven by shown metrics for 
various dataset with all environmental scenarios like heavy rain, foggy, mist etc., proposed approach 
uses Sobel edge detection. Since this paper uses very basic image processing features such as gradient 
and physical properties of hump. we can use this solution in any embedded platform without much effort.

Abstract 
Wastage is reduced in the manufacturing process by employing a lean manufacturing technique known as the pull 
production system. In pull production, Kanbans are used to manage production activities. They are a basis for: when 
an item is to be manufactured, how many are to be produced, etc. In the current operation, food and groceries are 
carried from one station to another and enhancing it using lean manufacturing principles is addressed in this article. 
The primary aim is to reduce inventory, eliminate shortages, and reduce system work-in-progress of raw materials, all 
of which will be accomplished through lean methodologies. A schematic diagram of the pull process is constructed 
considering the current workstations in the mess kitchen. The number of distinct kanban’s necessary is computed. 
Implementation of lean production system with kanban’s dramatically improves the mess's performance.  Compared 
to the existing system, the proposed system would use fewer raw materials (work-in-progress) to meet the same 
demand. The proposed system will greatly improve the system's efficiency and station cycle times.

1. Introduction
The main goal of lean manufacturing is to increase productivity while decreasing waste and expenses. Important 
measures towards this goal are to:(i) minimize the inventory levels and cycle time and (ii) increase the utilization of 
workforce and facilities and pull production is a proved tool for achieving the goal (Puchkova et al.2015). 
Conventionally, push production systems are in use for production operations. In push system, production quantity is 
determined in large lots and is pushed towards the downstream stations. Hence work-in-process (WIP) is usually very 
high and poor response to demand variations. As a result, a general push system has high inventory holding costs, 
short inventory turns, a significant risk of product disintegration, and low service levels (Puchkova et al.2016). Thus, 
many businesses have used a pull approach for production operations throughout the last few decades. The pull-type 
system directs production in response to client’s demand. Instead of pushing items from manufacturing capacity, it 
allows inventory levels to be constrained and the WIP is managed by kanbans. 
The kanban system is one of the strategies used in lean manufacturing to attain minimal inventory at any given time. 
The kanban method is beneficial in several ways for managing operations and business in a company. It aids in 
increasing firm’s productivity and reduces manufacturing waste. The Kanban method can be used in manufacturing 
for only when there is a demand for the product (Rabbani et al.2009). 
Kanban (kahn-bahn) is a Japanese term that literally translates to ""visible component"" (Rahman et al. 2013). In 
general, it refers to some form of signal so it refers to cards in production. The kanban method is based on a client 
requesting a part from the part's supplier. The client of the part might be a final product consumer (external) or the 
production staff at the next station in a manufacturing plant (internal). Similarly, in a manufacturing plant, the supplier 
may be the person at the previous station. Kanban’s principle is that material will not be created or moved unless a 
client signals it to do so. Most firms have created numerous tactics and ways to make their production processes more 
efficient and effective in order to attain manufacturing excellence. Most Japanese organizations utilize the kanban

The actual cycle time is calculated in terms of seconds per unit in the table above. Here, only the workstations 1 and 
2 have walking time because the materials need to be brought from the supermarket to the respective workstations. 
From workstation 5, items must be brought in on foot for processing at workstation 8. Finished goods are brought to 
the final counter on foot. All other workstations are close to each other; therefore, the walking time will be very small 
and can be neglected. From Table 8, it can be seen that none of the worker cycle time is more than the system cycle 
time.

6. Conclusions 
By implementing the Lean Pull system in the dining room, the continuous consumption of inventory between stations 
can be reduced, the kitchen staff is assigned to different work stations according to the nature of the food cooked and 
the time needed to cook. Stations 6, 7 and 8 were in charge of the cooks Therefore, it is difficult to reduce the cooking 
time. Helpers can be removed to balance the system, and one helper is removed from each of stations 1, 4, and 9. 
Since the combined cycle time of both workers at stations 1, 4, and 9 is 12, 18, and 30 seconds respectively. Also, this 
time is less than the system cycle time of 36 seconds. Therefore, one helper can be removed from each of these stations. 
 
The total number of workers in the mess were 20, comprising of 7 cooks and 13 helpers. But the proposed system 
requires only 5 cooks and 13 helpers with further looking upon cycle time of workers 3 more helpers can be removed 
from the station. Finally, the mess can be run by 11 workers (5 cooks and 6 helpers) only instead of proposed 20 
workers. 
Theoretically the maximum possible efficiency is 96% with 6 workstations. But the actual possible efficiency of the 
system is 72% achieved with 8 workstations. Items produced at each meal are level production as they are produced 
daily on demand. The dining room service level will significantly improve if the proposed system is implemented. It 
is possible to achieve zero stockouts or disgruntled inmates compared to the previous system. In the current system 
occasionally, final items or raw materials unavailability happens. The lead time for each food preparation activity is 
increased by scenically rearranging the workstation and reducing the waiting time of in process units.

Abstract 
This paper presents a case study highlighting the use of a spreadsheet to improve inventory visibility at one of the 
leading frit manufacturing firms. Inventory visibility is the ability to monitor and track inventory in real-time, as well 
as get insights into how many units of each SKU are in stock at each location and where it is held inside a warehouse 
or fulfillment facility. The frit manufacturing process consists of using different natural rock powders as raw materials 
and heating them to high temperatures to convert them into frit. At this manufacturing facility, inventory management 
and raw material procurement relied heavily on the warehouse manager's observation skills and knowledge. The 
procurement of raw materials was done depending upon the decrement in the existing stockpile of that raw material 
and consumption behavior. There was a need to have a real-time inventory monitoring system to track the internal 
flow of stock in real-time, plan future purchases, and increase inventory visibility in the industry. The use of this 
spreadsheet will help to bridge the gap between unforeseen human error and inventory visibility.

1. Introduction
In recent times, practitioners and researchers have been more interested in the concept of Supply Chain Visibility 
(SCV) (Catalayud et al. 2019). SCV refers to the ability to trace goods in transit from manufacturer to end destination. 
It is a complex process that involves people, processes, technology, and the flow of information. Sharma et al. (2020) 
presented the vulnerabilities faced by the companies due to low SCV in the events such as Covid-19. The disruption 
in the supply chain has affected the material supply, productivity, deliveries, and revenue. Low visibility is one of the 
biggest hindrances in achieving supply chain resilience. Sodhi and Tang (2019) revealed low visibility is one of the 
highlighted concerns expressed by many manufacturers. With challenges in SCV becoming more prevalent, it is 
critical to comprehend the development and implication of SCV (Swift et al. 2019). Poor visibility and uncoordinated 
multi-tier operations can result in increased inventory carrying costs, premium freight expenditures, and longer cycle 
times for these businesses. 
The increasing complexity in the supply chains is forcing organizations to adapt tools and technologies that improve 
visibility in daily functioning. Caridi et al. (2010) suggested that enterprises will need to invest more to deal with 
increased supply chain complexity. Dubey et al. (2019) stated that improving SCV can be used to construct a robust

One unique aspect of this spreadsheet is that if the operator enters 
more material than present in the stock during material outward 
entry, an alert appears on the home screen informing the operator 
that there is an insufficient quantity of the entered material. From 
the stock sheet above, we know that only 10 Ton of Q1 was there 
in the stock. Since the operator made an outward entry of >10 Ton, 
the spreadsheet showed a message of ‘INSUFFICIENT STOCK’ 
indicating that the amount entered isn’t available in the inventory 
currently. Figure 8 shows the alert that is displayed on the screen 
if the spreadsheet operator enters material outward data greater 
than the amount present in the current stock.  
 
 
5. Conclusion  
The complexities and importance of SCV have gained the attention of many supply chain practitioners and researchers 
IV. There is a lot of scope in the development of technologies that can help improve IV. In this case study, an 
underlying issue was identified and solved using advanced spreadsheet modelling. This issue if not solved earlier can 
impact the financial health of the company in the long run. The developed spreadsheet approach can be utilized by 
many companies that follow a very outdated approach to managing their inventories. The developed spreadsheet can 
be beneficial to the supply chain professionals to properly communicate on SCV, which is a major issue for many 
firms interested in operating in an end-to-end environment.

Abstract 
In the year 20-21, globally India stands fifth in solar power capacity. The Indian government is eager to promote 
solar energy as one of the country's major energy sources. The objective of this research is to examine the 
Behavioral aspects which result towards the adoption of solar energy systems among household in India, which 
will further allow policymakers to increase the implementation of this exciting innovative eco-friendly 
technology. The framework of UTAUT2 with role of awareness, government policies, perceived functional 
benefit and risk-taking ability is used in this study to recognise and develop a quantitative approach and analyse 
their impact on the Behavioral intention of the rural households to adopt solar energy systems. The structural 
equation modelling (SEM) approach was used to examine the data of 516 collected from the field survey 
questionnaire. The outcomes mainly showed that Behavioral intention is largely predicted by government 
policies followed by facilitating conditions.

1. Introduction
Energy is considered as a crucial component of the economic growth of any nation. It has been claimed that 
without energy, sustainable development is almost unattainable. According to Abdullah, 2013 Increase in 
energy use results in growth and improved overall economic development of the nation's economy. The 
electricity sector is ultimately responsible for ensuring that sufficient power is provided to the users. The energy 
generation, efficiency, and reach of the distribution network are crucial elements that form the ability of the 
power sector to meet the demand of energy (Amewornu and Nwulu, 2020). In 2006, The International Energy 
Agency forecasted that by 2030 there would be an increase of sixty per cent from the current scenario in respect 
of the energy requirement of the whole world. A two-thirds rise will be due to China, India and their rapidly 
growing industries, which account for close to half the aggregate worldwide demand of energy by 2030 
(International Energy Agency, 2010; Kumar et. al., 2019).  
Despite widespread policy agreement, we are falling short of meeting international promises to deliver 
sustainable energy for all (World Bank, 2017). As reported by IEA in its SDG7 tracking progress report of 2020, 
during 2018, twenty countries with the greatest access deficits accounted for seventy-eight percent of the entire 
inhabitants lacking access to electricity. By addressing different technological, economical and institutional 
restrictions a transition toward greener energy can be achieved. Apart from all those, human resistance to 
change and its acceptance of solar power technology will be the final frontier (Aggarwal et al., 2019). This is 
especially noticeable in locations where good sunshine and farming conditions are favourable (Neira et al., 
2013).  
India has a potential for large amounts of energy generated by solar light as it has between 300 and 330 sun days 
a year (MNRE, 2018; Kumar et al., 2019). This potential has been referred in various studies in India 
context(International Energy Agency, IEA, 2010; Gevorg, 2011; Zarnikau, 2003). The absence of electrical 
availability by almost four hundred million in distant locations has intensified the need to use solar energy as an 
energy source (International Energy Agency, 2013; Kumar et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2020). The Indian 
Government, through the MNRE, is pushing this effort to achieve 100GW of solar photovoltaic energy by the 
year 2022, which contains 40 GW target out of the solar rooftop (MNRE, GoI, 2013; 2020; Aggarwal et al., 
2019). Despite established numerous benefits from solar power and its widespread global reach, private 
domestic investment on the solar rooftop is largely uncommon (Masini and Menichetti, 2013; Parsad et al., 
2020). The solar mission's long-standing success is when it develops without governmental assistance as a

Abstract 
Active Direct Methanol Fuel Cell (ADMFC) is chemical energy to electrical energy converter device akin to a battery 
for portable electrical appliances. Its construction is simple and compact without moving parts. One of the objectives 
is to develop a lightweight active direct methanol fuel cell for better portability and to improve the gravitational power 
density of the cell. At present assembling of the cell, it is made using Mild Steel (MS) bolts and nuts with insulating 
sleeves and Bakelite washers for maintaining electrical isolations.  The density of the MS material is 7.8 g/cm3. Hence 
less density material having the compatibility with a dilute methanol environment is a better solution for aiming at a 
reduced weight of the cell. Hence FRP fasteners comprising bolts and nuts are well suitable for the replacement of the 
MS bolting system.

Abstract 
The paper here presents the modelling of grid-connected solar photovoltaic system with LCL filter design with Voltage 
Source Converter control. The system model comprises of PV Array, Boost Converter, Voltage Source Inverter, LCL 
Filter, Utility Grid and Loads. The Boost converter makes fluctuating input DC to constant output DC. Voltage Source 
Inverter converters DC boost voltage to three phase AC voltage. The VSC is switching through the PWM technique 
has been controlled through a control unit comprising of the outer and inner control loops. The harmonics in the system 
has been caused by the power electronics devices and non-linear loads connected in the system and the presence of 
these harmonics in the system has reduced the power quality and operation of the system. The synchronization of the 
three phase output of the inverter to grid has been done through PLL. The modelling of the system has been done in 
MATLAB and an analysis of THD will be done on steady state of the grid voltage and current and inverter current. 
The THD of the grid currents has also been compared at two different values of solar irradiance. In order to mitigate 
the harmonics and improve the power quality of the system an LCL filter has been used and its value has been 
calculated to reduce voltage and current THD below IEEE standards.

1. Introduction
As with the demand for electricity has been grown in the past years, the need for renewable energy has grown which 
can provide cheap energy and are abundant in nature to cater the large demand. As the conventional energy resources 
availability are limited, the need for renewable energy sources are on the rise in the world. Solar as the renewable 
energy source is by far the best choice for tropical zone due to abundance of availability, less running cost, less wear 
and tear due to less moving parts and low noise production. The utilization of the solar PV power is better when it is 
connected to grid but there are some problems with the solar power system as unbalancing of voltage, sag and swell 
in the voltage, low power factor and harmonics in current and voltages. The major problem with the solar integrated 
grid system is the power quality in the voltage source inverter as well as grid, as the VSC converter output contain 
some harmonics. The VSC output is connected to grid which need to be synchronized and the harmonics of VSC 
output current should also be reduced. In order to reduce harmonics of output current of VSC an LCL filter with 
damping resistance has been used for this model. The damping resistance reduces the resonating problem in the 
system. The non-linear loads in the modelled system also produces some harmonics in the system. The modelled 
system contains solar PV array with Perturb and Observe MPPT algorithm, a DC-DC Boost converter controlled by 
duty cycle through P&O algorithm, a Voltage source converter and its dual loop control circuit, LCL filter, utility grid 
and non-linear and linear loads. And the THD of voltage and current of the grid and inverter current is calculated with 
and without LCL filter and the THD of grid current with LCL filter has been compared at two different values of 
irradiance. The LCL filter has been the most effective passive filters among all the passive filter in grid-connected 
photovoltaic system as conventional L and LC filter are less effective in harmonic attenuation, larger in size and

Figure 14. Inverter Current THD with LCL filter 
The Fourier analysis of the Inverter current shows that the filter reduces the harmonics quite efficiently and the current 
fed to the grid is balanced and in harmony to the grid current. The LCL filter topology used here is discussed above 
which is wye connected LCL with damping resistance, the inductors are connected in series on the inverter side as 
well as on the grid side and the capacitor is placed in between the inverters in parallel and the damping resistance is 
also is in series with the capacitor. 
The Table 2 shown below indicates the THD comparison of grid voltage, grid current and the inverter output current 
without the use of any filter and after the use of the LCL filter with damping resistance. From the Table 2, it is evident 
that the LCL filter helps in reducing harmonics in both grid and inverter current. The effect on grid voltage is negligible 
here as the grid is almost acting as a constant voltage source without any effect of the load.

6. Conclusion 
The modelled PV system of 100 Kw, grid connected LCL filter with dual loop control gives THD values within limits 
without resonance problem, so the modelling design is functioning within limits. The system modelled here has been 
analyzed with and without filters and it can be seen that a filter is very necessary for the harmonic mitigation if the 
control scheme of inverter is not able to eliminate the total harmonics. The control scheme here was only able to 
reduce the lower order harmonics and the higher order harmonics are eliminated through the LCL filter with resistance 
damping with optimal values of inductor and capacitor. The solar irradiance also affects the THD, as can be seen from 
the Fourier analysis of inverter current with LCL filter. The inverter current at 1000 W/m2 has THD as 4.77% but at 
800 W/m2 irradiance the THD is 5.10% which is slightly more when irradiance is decreased in this system. The system 
parameters which are taken and are calculated has been given in the Table 3 below.

Abstract 
The main objective of a supply chain is to fulfil the customer demands in the right quantity at the right time. If an 
organization cannot meet the customer demand, stockout or out-of-stock situations happen. Inventory stockouts are 
costly to the organization and are very common in supply chains. It not only results in the loss of revenue but also 
affects the service level, which results in a loss of competitive advantage. Stockouts can be prevented by proper 
inventory planning and control. For any organization, it is crucial to maintain optimum inventory levels to ensure 
customer satisfaction. These days, technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning give organizations 
the ability to foresee the future and proactively manage their inventory in the supply chain. This study investigates 
various supervised machine learning classifiers. It proposes the best machine learning stock out prediction model for 
each member of a four-stage divergent supply chain with eight members. Since the dataset for such a supply chain is 
not available, a supply chain operation simulation has been conducted under three distinct inventory replenishing 
policies such as Order-Up-To (OUT), Order-Up-To Smoothing (OUTS) and (s, S). Data generated from the 
simulation is divided into two sets, the train set and the test set. Various supervised machine learning algorithms are 
trained using training dataset. A five-fold cross-validation technique is adopted for the validation of the model. A 
random search cross-validation technique adjusts the hyperparameters of each classifier. The performance of the 
model is evaluated on the test dataset based on the assessment matrices, and it is found that boosting algorithms 
perform better than the other classifiers. This study proposes a meta-learning-based stacked ensemble model, using 
XG boost, Ada boost and random forest classifiers as the base model. The performance evaluation shows that for 
each supply chain member, the stacked ensemble model performs better than other classifiers, including boosting 
classifiers.

1. Introduction
A supply chain is a network of nodes which aims to meet customers’ demands (Kurian et al., 2020). It consists of 
various members, i.e., Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, Wholesaler, Retailer and Customers. For any supply 
chain, one of the most important assets is inventory, as it enables businesses to fulfil their customers’ requirements 
in terms of quantity and time. A stockout, usually known as an out-of-stock (OOS), occurs whenever an 
organization cannot satisfy the customers’ demand with their existing inventory. This stockout event is possible 
throughout the whole supply chain. 
An investigation of the prevalence and scale of stockouts in supply chains and distribution systems was carried out 
by Gartner Inc. and is recognized as the preeminent research and advising for business worldwide. Non-promoted 
commodities and promoted items encounter between six and ten percent stockouts and between eighteen and 
twenty-four percent, respectively (Oroojlooyjadid et al., 2017).

performs better than raw boosting algorithms for every member irrespective of the inventory policy followed by the 
members of the divergent supply chain. 
 
Under the OUT-inventory policy, Factory has a comparatively high-performance measure than other supply chain 
members. Although, Random Forest with other boosting models performs better than other classifiers. For 
Distributor, Random Forest and XG Boost have higher AUC values after the stacked ensemble model. In the case of 
wholesalers, Gradient Boosting Model and Random Forest perform better. For retailers, XG Boost and ANN 
performs better than other classifiers. In contrast and SVC perform worst throughout the supply chain under the 
OUT-inventory policy. In the case of OUT smoothing inventory policy, the highest F1 Score can be observed at the 
Factory stage. For factory, XG Boost overperform compared toother classifiers. For the Distributor, CAT Boost and 
Random Forest perform better, whereas for Wholesalers and distributor XG Boost and Adaptive Boosting perform 
better than other supervised ML classifiers. In the case of (s, S) inventory policy, Factory has outstanding 
performance for Adaptive boosting, and Distributor has best AUC score for XG Boost. Whereas for Wholesalers 
and Retailers, XG Boost, and Adaptive Boosting have maximum AUC Score and F1- Score. 
 
From the review of the performance assessment, it can be noticed that XG Boost, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive 
Boosting and Random Forest are the best classifiers. XG Boost is nothing but modified version of Gradient Boosting 
classifier. In order to improve the performance of ML classifiers, A meta learning based Stacked Ensembled Model 
(SEM) has been developed with XG Boost, Adaptive Boost and Random Forest as base classifiers and Logistic 
Regression as Final estimator, which performs better than other ensemble learning models. Table 9 provides the 
performance of the developed stacked ensemble model. It has the minimum AUC score of 0.8671 for the wholesaler 
under the OUTS inventory policy. Whereas maximum AUC score of 0.9558 is noticed at Factory under (s, S) 
inventory policy. AUC score in the range of 0.8671 to 0.9558 indicates that the stacked ensemble model has ahigh 
degree of predictive power. It can also be used for those practical cases in which demand distribution and inventory 
policy are unknown. However, the performance can be affected to some degree in accordance with the nature of the 
data.  
 
After identifying the most reliable predictive classification model, it can be implemented in the real world. The 
stockout prediction model will help managers in predicting when stockouts will occur throughout the time. Using 
the model's predictions, managers may determine how much inventory they should acquire to avoid a stockout. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Inventory stockouts are costly to the organization and are very common in supply chains. Occurrence of stockout 
results in degradation of the overall supply chain performance. Poor inventory planning results in not only loss of 
revenue but also loss of market share. This situation can be overcome by proper inventory planning and control. 
With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning, supply chain managers are interested inosinate 
driven approach for making inventory-related decisions. This study considers a simple type of divergent supply 
chain with four-stage and eight members under different inventory-position-based inventory policies such as OUT, 
OUT Smoothing and (s, S). Python-based supply chain operation simulation is conducted for each inventory policy. 
The output of the simulation experiment reveals that (s, S) inventory policy has the highest stockout instances at 
each stage, followed by the OUT and OUT smoothing inventory policy. Data generated from supply chain inventory 
simulation is used for training and testing the machine learning classifiers. 
 
The problem of data imbalance is solved by employing SMOTE sampling techniques, and it is found that algorithms 
used with sampling techniques perform better those without sampling techniques. Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) is a technique that helps to eliminate the multicollinearity issue that arises while developing machine learning 
models. Tuning of the model's hyperparameters is required to get a stable and high-quality level of performance in 
the prediction process. 
 
The primary focus of this research has been analysing various machine learning algorithms to predict stockouts. 
Considering this developed prediction models for each participant of a four-stage divergent supply chain consisting 
of eight members operating under three distinct inventory replenishment policies.  
 
The assessment matrices show that the performance of the model developed with boosting classifiers is better than 
that of other classifiers for every supply chain member under each inventory policy. It has also been found that the

combination of XG Boost, Ada Boost and Random Forest as a stacked ensemble model outperforms boosting 
algorithm and comes out as the best model for every supply chain member under all three inventory replenishing 
policies. A predictive classification model can be deployed for practical implementation once the best one has been 
identified. When the prediction model is used during order management, it will give every supply chain member the 
ability to take control measures. As a result, it will give rise to better operations and management of the supply 
chain. 
 
Scope of future work includes deploying both simulation model and prediction model for better user experience. In 
this study, supervised machine learning models are investigated. In the extension of this work, deep learning 
algorithms can be investigated for stockout prediction, as they may perform better. The study's future scope also 
includes the estimation of stockout quantities in the event of stockout instance. When stockouts are foreseen, action 
can be taken to prevent such a situation by including predicted stockout quantities into the usual order quantity.

Abstract 
The restaurant supply chain starts from the raw material collection to final product delivery. In today’s digital 
world restaurants are maintaining both traditional and digitalized methods for supply chain processes. In the first 
phase of the process, fixing the quantity of raw material demand analysis is a crucial factor for making decisions 
to avoid wastage of product or even stock-outs. As the raw material involved in the process is perishable it’s 
very important to keep it in the right quantity and quality standard to avoid serious issues to the people eating it. 
This study aims to analyze the upstream supply chain process of a startup restaurant. Upstream supply chain 
activity is linked with the supplier and raw material intake. Direct observation is done regarding their upstream 
supply chain activity and a theoretical study is done based on it. Information regarding the various sources of the 
raw material intake in that restaurant is collected. Further, analysis is done to identify the Strength, Weaknesses, 
Opportunities, and Threats of their Supply chain activities. In this study, suggestions are incorporated with 
managerial implication to enrich their Strength, make more utilization of their opportunities, washout the 
weakness and maintain barriers from potential threats. Correlation analysis is done to evaluate effect of supplier 
delay and preparation time delay on missed orders. It is found that both supplier delay and Food preparation 
delay is highly correlated to missed food orders.

1. Introduction
Supply chain Management (SCM) is the chain of process that starts from procurement of raw material to 
delivering final products to customers. The nature and participants are different for various types of supply 
chain. Industrial supply chain is differed from a supermarket supply chain, so and so. The supply chain activity 
can be divided into three based on supply chain flow, the main activity focuses on role of suppliers, internal 
functions of company and of customers (Al-Shboul et al.,2017) This paper discusses about a restaurant supply 
chain. A restaurant has several elements like buying raw materials, cooking food items, taking orders, dining, 
deliveries, billing and many more backend processes. A simple mistake in supply chain management can cause 
huge revenue loss, product wastage; can affect brand image and customer loyalty, sometimes leads to severe 
food borne illness type of issues. Thus, a restaurant manager should manage the supply chain with utmost care. 
The study emphasis on upstream supply chain management. Upstream supply chain practice was developed by 
Govidan et al. (2014). The supply chain practice with focuses on role of supplier including strategic supply 
chain partnerships (Sundaram et al., 2016). By implementing proper supplier management internal activities can 
build the upstream integration. The firm tries to communicate with upstream suppliers to get the quality items 
based on the requirements (Truong et al., 2017). Supply chain activity is a practice adopted to produce and 
effective and efficient process in managing supply chain flow to coordinate the requirements based on customer 
demand (Al-Shboul et al,..2018). Restaurants involve suppliers in solving problems to build a perfect purchasing 
strategy (Tarigan et al., 2020). Restaurant can build market intelligence to adopt contingent situation occur 
among the internal and external factors such as customers, competitor, technology changes and regulations 
(Alnawas and Hemsley Brown, 2019). The firm’s capability to communicate and integrate with suppliers will 
impact restaurant when they get environmentally friendly material and materials which have longer lifetime 
(Sautma et al.,2021). Restaurants can depend on purchasing strategy to build collaborations with suppliers in 
providing eco labeled products and to meet the requirements based on government regulations (Tarigan et 
al.,2020). 
FOODIE PANDA is a new restaurant started in pallichal, Trivandrum. It offers dinning in and delivery facility. 
They completed all their mandatory government proceeding and started operation by mid of January 2022. They 
offer good food in great nature ambience with live music performance. This paper intended to learn more about

Karl Pearson’s Correlation analysis found that both Supplier delay and food preparation delay is highly
correlated to the number of food orders missed. The correlation is so much significant as it is 0.976.
5. Conclusion
For an emerging restaurant like Foodie Panda, it’s very important to keep good records on upstream supply 
chain management. As far as new venture is concerned it will be having its own growth period to get established 
by their name so to maintain its profit level every part of the activity should be managed properly. This study 
gives an overall idea about the upstream supply chain activity of the concerned restaurant. Based on the 
Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat analysis the study identified the status of upstream supply chain 
management of the new restaurant Foodie Panda. Identified the point of improvement. If the restaurant 
maintained its strength by exploring the opportunities by reducing weakness and competing with threat, then in 
a long run the firm will be a success. Correlation Analysis and graphical representation is done based on 
supplier timing, Food preparation timing and missed orders. We identified that supplier should maintain proper 
time for delivering raw materials otherwise it will affect the whole process. The food preparation timing will be 
lagged, and restaurant will miss its valuable orders. We found that these factors are highly correlated. Proper 
Timing should be maintained for a cost-effective supply chain flow.

Abstract 
Sustainability has now linked as the foundation of any development. Economical sustainability has been a thrust for 
corporates since long but Environmental Sustainability was mostly neglected upto 20th century whereas Social 
Sustainability is still categories as less explored dimension. The objective of this paper is to underst the growing 
importance evolution of social environmental dimensions of sustainability in literature specifically related to leather 
sector. A bibliometric analysis was carried out to achieve the above objective. Scopus database was searched by 
using a large number of keywords in the title abstract fields. The resulted 542 articles were scanned after removing 
the duplicity, articles in languages other than English those got published after the year 2000, 349 articles were 
finally selected. A descriptive analysis of these articles were conducted, based on the significant contributions of 
influential authors, organizations, countries, publication sources, titles keywords etc., using the different open 
softwares like Mendeley, VOS-viewer etc.Our findings shows that in the leather sector,  in our selected dimensions 
of sustainability, researchers’ interest grew after 2012 before which the publications in these areas remained only in 
single digit per year. India is the most contributing country in leather sector, followed by the United State of 
America Italy. Another interesting observation was that around 10% of these documents were published in the 
Proceedings of 34th IULTCS Congress held at Chennai, India in the year 2017 with a theme “science technology for 
sustainability of leather”. Journal of Cleaner Production is the second most contributing resource followed by the 
Journal of the American leather chemists association, together these 3 resources contributed more than 20% of the 
selected documents.Also social dimension of sustainability was probably neglected by researchers in leather sector 
as only in 6 documents keyword “social aspects” appeared  only in one article “social sustainability” keyword was 
stated. Our researched have certain limitations, as we restricted our searched to SCOPUS data base only future 
researchers may explore other databases too.This study will contribute in understing the growing role of social 
environmental dimensions of sustainability for the policy makers/managers/researchers in the leather sector.

1. Introduction
Sustainability is a buzz word in the literature. Every year, thouss of articles are published that deals with this aspect 
in one way or the other after the introduction of the concept of sustainable development in 1992. The term 
sustainability is still a highly dispersed diverse topic even after this large volume of publications. Driven by social

the sustainability practices, while the leather sector was chosen to spot the pace of application of sustainability 
interdisciplinary research in this sector. Small number of papers got published in the area of social sustainability 
practices bibliometric analysis of the searched domain sector was not spotted during the selected time frame. 
Accordingly, to fill this literature gap, we conducted this bibliometric analysis by bibliometrix R package other open 
softwares like VOS-viewer. This paper highlights the conceptual structure of the field its evolution over a period. 
Prior to commencement of this study, certain choices regarding research questions, keywords to be searched, 
database to be explored analysis tools to be used was made. After data collection, analysis of the collected articles 
was carried out. Analysis started with the aspect of authors influence followed by affiliation analysis, source 
relevancy, most cited articles, keywords co-citation analysis. Analysis revealed that, Rao. J. R. is the most 
contributing author with 8 articles whereas National engineering laboratory for clean technology of leather 
manufacture, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China is the most relevant affiliating institution with 5 articles India is 
the most contributing country with 100 co-authorships. Proceedings of the 34th IULTCS Congress: Science  
Technology for Sustainability of Leather is the most contributing source with 31 documents but with poor citations 
of only 1 while Journal of Cleaner Production is the most relevant resource with 25 documents  more than 941 
citations. Igiri et al. 2018 is the most cited documents with 242 citations a Total Citations/year of 80. Leather is the 
most used keywords with 163 occurrences followed by sustainable development tanning with 131  75 occurrences 
respectively. Later on co-citation analysis revealed the co-cited authors, documents  sources. Furstenau et al. (2020) 
resulted that the scientific efforts are focused to enhance economic environmental aspects a lack of effort relating the 
social sphere of sustainability is visible. Our analysis reaffirmed this finding as out of the 349 selected articles in the 
selected domain in leather sector only 56 documents mentioned the social dimension in some way, further only in 6 
articles social aspects occurred as a key word social sustainability occurred only in 1 article as a keyword. This 
clearly shows the negligence of scientific efforts in social dimensions in leather sector. 
 
5. Limitations future research directions 
Through a dynamic analysis, this paper helps to underst the evolution of social environmental sustainability 
practices in leather sector. However, the work has limitations. The Scopus database was searched, that does not 
include all journals, enhance many papers might have been omitted. Although this work is based on a single 
database, the research inferences willaid as a base for futuristic studies. More largely, future researchers may 
perhaps need tosightsee the other databases too along-with Scopus using various keywords. So, this study may work 
as a starting point for the upcoming researchers in the presented domain sector.

Abstract 
India ranks number one for the number of road accident deaths caused across 199 countries as reported in the 
World Road Statistics, 2018 followed by China and US (Business standard, 2022). As per the WHO Global Report 
on Road Safety 2018, India accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the World. Many of the 
fatal injuries could be avoided if the victim had quick access to the medicine. The aim of this project is to analyze 
and provide insights to the implementing party such as social entrepreneurs, start-ups or government agencies 
about the potential of installing First Aid Medicine Vending Machine in the accident-prone areas and in the 
locations having less access to medicine. In the event of a mishap at locations where therapeutic stores are not 
within the compass, First Aid Medicine Vending Machine ensures the availability of first aid kit 24x7. It has a 
QR code, which can be scanned by the customers to make payments for the first aid medicines received. The 
machine would be capable of accepting paper notes and also scan debit or credit cards. Also, it is proposed to 
provide the nearest hospital address and contact numbers on the machine. The project proposal includes: Identified 
accident zones in Bangalore city, Human Resource framework and strategies to implement the proposed plan, 
Marketing strategy and promotional plan to create awareness among consumers about the usage of First Aid 
Medicine Vending Machine, Cost analysis for the implementation of the proposed project.

1. Introduction
India ranks number 1 in the total number of road accident deaths across the 199 countries as reported in the World 
Road Statistics, 2018 followed by China and US. As per the WHO Global Report on Road Safety 2018, India 
accounts for almost 11% of the accident-related deaths in the World. Report published by the Union Ministry of 
Road Transport and Highways, Road Accidents in India (2021) states that India, with only 1% of the world’s 
vehicles, accounted for 11% of all accident-related deaths. Further, 29.5% of these road accidents were fatal, 
claiming 1.5 lakh lives. There are approximately 20 accidents zones in Bangalore which cost 7700 lives in past 
12yrs. 
It is likely that, some of these deaths could have been avoided if the victim had got prompt emergency medical 
care. Infact, in the Pt Parmanand Kataravs. Union of India and Ors case (1989), the Supreme Court had held that 
Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to emergency medical care. 
The Supreme Court had also emphasized the importance of the “Golden Hour” that is ‘the time period lasting one 
hour following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood of preventing death by providing 
prompt medical care’. The mandated response time for cardiac, respiratory, stroke and accident cases is 10 
minutes. However, actual response time for all these types of emergencies was above 10 minutes in more than 
60% of cases. Further, in 50% of trauma cases, the patients were admitted to the hospital after the “Golden Hour”.

5. Conclusion 
This study has been conducted by the MBA students of Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences to provide 
necessary insights and analysis for the proposal of First Aid Medicine Vending Machine for the accident zones 
of Bangalore city. This Project Proposal is expected to assist social Entrepreneurs, Government 
Initiatives/agencies and other companies for the implementation of proposed plan to utilize the potential of 
Medicine Vending Machine. Following are the results of analysis carried out in this project work: 
 
• Bangalore city is in third place with 5520 accidents occurring, movement of around 42 lakhs of vehicles and 
740 deaths due to accidents. 
• We have observed that 481 people were injured, 437 accidents were non-fatal, 105 accidents were killed, 102 
accidents were fatal during 2022 till February 2022. During 2021, 2828 accidents were injured, 2593 accidents 
were non-fatal, 651 accidents were killed, 618 accidents were fatal. We have observed that, in the year 2022, in 
a period of 2 months, around 102 accidents have taken place.  The data analytics predicts that, there would be 600 
cases by end of the year 2022. This is same as the last year. By establishing the First Aid Medicine Vending 
Machine near the accidental prone areas we can reduce the non-fatal and fatal accidents by minimum 50-60% by 
providing the necessary treatment at the accidental spot itself.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown has caused massive disruption in almost every sector of the economy 
in India and informal sector has been the worst affected. The sericulture and handloom industry being the 
second most employers in the informal sector is important to the economy in terms of employment generation, 
output and export. But, the industry has been engulfed with manifold problems since its inception and COVID-
19 crisis worsened the condition of the sericulture workers. In this context, the current study is an attempt to 
look into the impact of pandemic and lockdown on the industry in the informal sector in Karnataka and the key 
problems faced by the workers in their everyday life. Taking information from both primary and secondary 
sources, it is observed that the sericulture industry in Karnataka is severely affected by COVID-19 and 
lockdown which resulted in loss of income and livelihood to the handloom workers. Ban on non-essential 
transportation facilities led to unavailability of raw materials, inflated price of yarn and dyes. Closure of 
markets resulted in unsold clothes piling up in weavers’ residents which drastically affected revenue generation 
in this sector. The weavers are living and working in ill standard houses and suffering from malnutrition, 
indebtedness etc.

About 85% of the funds for S&T come directly or indirectly from the Government, Central Silk Board (CSB), 
Bangalore under the Ministry of Textiles, Government of India is the apex body for overall development of 
sericulture and silk industry in India.   
 
Policy initiatives taken for the development of silk industry:  
a) National Silk Policy 2020 
b) Sericulture is included as agriculture allied activity under RKVY. This enables the Seri culturists to avail 
the benefits of the scheme for the entire sericulture activities up to reeling.  
c) The CSB (Amendment) Act, Rules and Regulations have been notified by the Govt. of India to bring 
quality standards in silkworm seed production.  
 
6. Conclusion   
The data obtained by the survey was analysed by statistical tools (SPSS Software) based on this interpretation 
were made. The present study briefly depicts a general picture of the sericulture weavers in the country and the 
multidimensional problems being faced by them. Both the primary and secondary data shows that sericulture 
workers are living in ill standard houses which are responsible for their poor health and unproductive working 
condition. They are having very low level of income resulting in acute poverty and hence malnutrition among 
them.

Cronbach’s Alpha is .716  
 
6.1 Findings 
• 
The COVID-19 pandemic and repeated lockdowns continue to take a toll on Karnataka’s weavers, both 
in the handloom and power loom sectors. Their income has dropped 70 per cent to 80 per cent, in the past 
year many are caught in deep financial crisis and wonder if they’d ever be able to get back on track.  
• 
In Doddaballapura, several looms have closed following a drop in sales. March to May remains the 
peak season with marriage orders and bulk purchases. But with lockdown restrictions, their business 
remains affected.  
• 
They are living on a hand-to-mouth budget. It’s because the government is giving them ration, they are 
able to live. The financial distress is unbearable to most of them and has drastically affected their 
livelihood.   
• 
By the time they could recover from the economic downfall in 2019, the pandemic hit them again and 
while they thought the worst was over and resumed work in October 2020, the second wave completely 
halted their business. With the pandemic spreading to rural areas, work did not resume in most of the 
region.   
• 
A weaver, Sanjeevappa, 47, says he can earn only ₹500 a week as the loom owner has capped the work 
to five saris a week to each worker. Nagaraja says he used to earn ₹3,000 before the lockdown. The 
financial packages or the loan moratorium did not reach workers, he says it helped loom owners, but not 
him.

Abstract 
Recent advancements in CAE have made it possible to create several new sheet metals forming techniques that are 
best based on more traditional technology. The goal of the current work is to conduct an experimental investigation 
of the behaviour of 1.5 mm thick aluminium alloy AA5052 H-32 during single point incremental forming in terms of 
major strain, minor strain and calculated thickness. An optical measuring device uses a circle grid to indicate the 
measurement area to estimate strain. The full factorial approach was used for the experiment design. Using Autodesk 
Fusion 360, it is possible to significantly generate the necessary tool paths and shape. For the experimental work, a 
truncated square pyramid geometry with a 60-degree angle was chosen.

1. Introduction
Single point incremental forming (SPIF) is a cutting-edge method for producing small batches of sheet parts quickly 
and profitably. Because SPIF is a die-less process, it may create parts with a wide variety of thicknesses and 
symmetrical and non-symmetrical geometries. The automotive sector, the aerospace industry, home appliances, and 
many more industries use sheet metal shaping. Additionally, it is simple and affordable to manufacture the needed 
components. Numerous researchers are attempting to satisfy client demands utilizing diverse manufacturing 
techniques without compromising product quality. It should be noted that any adjustments must be made easily for a 
new design or concept, and that newly established manufacturing methods must be able to produce necessary parts 
for the chosen material. Because of its versatility in part formation, incremental sheet forming (ISF) is the production 
technique most used in the automotive and aerospace sectors. It is possible to direct the movements of the Tool using 
a three-axis CNC/VMC machine. To limit the degree of freedom in the X and Y directions, the fixture should be 
designed accordingly. Even so, the downward indentation made by the tool should allow the clamped sheet to move 
freely in the Z direction. Any CAM software is used to generate tool paths. There is a variety of software, including 
ARTCAM, FUSION 360, Inventor, and others. In this project, we want to use Fusion 360 to generate Tool paths and 
construct a CAD model of the necessary shape. In this study, a tool path is generated according to our process 
parameter using a 3D contour tool path.

today that allow sheet metal to be locally plastically deformed, allowing for genuinely flexible manufacture of intricate 
sheet metal components. This can be accomplished either through the manufacturing of usable rapid prototypes in a

Figure 13. Main Effects plot for Calculated Thickness 
 
The primary effect plots for the major strain and minor strain are shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12. Major strain has 
been seen to increase when the step depth is decreased and decrease when the step depth is increased. The spindle 
speed and feed rate show the same phenomenon. Tables 4 and 5 present the results of an ANOVA for major strain and 
minor strain, respectively, where spindle speed is the most significant factor. 
 
The calculated thickness's primary effect plot is shown in Figure 13. It was shown that calculated thickness reduces 
with decreasing step depth and increases with rising step depth. The spindle speed and feed rate follow a similar 
pattern. Table 6 shows the ANOVA for the computed thickness, with spindle speed being the most significant variable. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The following conclusions were drawn from the present investigation are above graphical representation: 
Step depth, spindle speed and feed rate are the influential parameters affecting major strain, minor strain, and thickness 
of sheet in single point incremental forming. Present contributions of process parameters to the major strain, minor 
strain and calculated thickness of sheet were made assuming other process parameters as constant. 
As Step depth increases the value of major strain, minor strain decreases, and thickness increases respectively. 
With increase in value of Spindle speed and feed rate, the value of major strain and minor strain decreases, while 
thickness increases. 
Thus, Spindle speed has the larger influence on output response i.e major strain, minor strain and calculated thickness.

Abstract 
Worldwide food contamination crises and their consequence on health and monetary losses inflated public concerns, 
putting food supply chain under pressure to assure quality and safety. When short shelf life food products go through 
post-harvest process, it becomes difficult to isolate contamination source. Consequently, supplier claims to produce 
good quality food, meanwhile it reaches to consumer’s contaminations occurs in transit, which results in financial 
and reputation loss. Hence, food traceability is highly important to combat losses and maintain quality as expected. 
Internet of things (IoT) has potential to improve performance of logistic through traceability. Despite all the 
advantages, it imposes a mere cost on supply chain players. However, they can consider it as an opportunity to raise 
consumer fidelity when quality sensitive consumers are ready to bear additional cost. So this system termed as 
public priced traceability. Further, implementation of proposed traceability raises the question of investment 
decision that who will bear the implementation cost. To address the question a game theory approach applied. 
Mathematical model is developed for individual supplier, retailer and centralized investment. Numerical study 
revealed that in centralized investment model is the most profitable option, although selling price and information 
sensing price is higher than other models.

1. Introduction
Defects in manufacturing and functionality are now a concern to consumers. Such defects have led to product 
recalls, such as those of smart phones (CNN 2016) and medical devices (Ball et al. 2018). Contrasting other supply 
networks, the perishable food supply chain is more difficult due to improved quality assurance, effective information 
transmission, and handling requirements (Tsang et al. 2020). The food supply chain is further broken down into a 
number of phases. Supplier assesses product quality at each step of harvest. In this case, all of the supplier's efforts 
to produce a high-quality product result in financial losses if the environment parameters (temperature, pressure, and 
humidity) of the final product are not monitored during the logistics process. The demand of consumers for quality 
food is triggered by the numerous food scandals. The scandals with disastrous consequences are, milk contamination 
with melamine (Xiu and Klein 2010) and horse meat scandal in 2013 (Behnke and Janssen 2020). Consumers place 
the highest level of hygiene expectations on food, but the supply chain has been plagued by quality scandals and 
hygiene violations. As a result, people are becoming more sensitive about the quality of the products they purchase 
as well as their origin and delivery conditions, even though these facilities are more expensive. Consumers in China 
are reportedly willing to pay more for pork traceability, according to a recent survey (Wu et al. 2016).  As a result, 
consumers are crucial in motivating participants in the supply chain to fund the traceability system. Such a system of 
traceability is known as a public priced system.  
Consumers' desire to validate the accuracy and provenance of data is growing quickly. As a result, supply chain 
participants must build an effective traceability system for the accurate distribution of information if they want to

Abstract 
Maintaining a proper quality during export of perishables is a challenging issue as they degrade rapidly ones 
harvested. Hence, cold chain export is adopted. In order to deliver fresh and high-quality products to the end 
customer appropriate temperature-controlled distribution must be ensured. The current study targets 
‘distribution at destination’ part of the cold chain taking into account the produce quality degradation. An 
optimization problem is formulated for minimizing the total cost of distribution of temperature sensitive 
perishables so that the desired quality produce reaches the customer in consumable condition. The temperature 
dependent overall quality of the produce is determined from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation 
and Kinetic rate law model. The cold chain export of an Indian mango variety namely ‘Alphonso’ from India to 
Singapore has been illustrated as a case study. The results show that the developed distribution plan can assure 
the fulfilment of customer prerequisites at lowest cost.

1. Introduction
One of the major goals of export industries is to ensure that the produce reaches the destination and the end 
customers in acceptable condition, on time, with minimum cost. This becomes more challenging for perishable 
produce, including fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat and fish products, as they tend to degrade ones 
harvested or processed. The rate of degradation of produce depends upon various internal and external factors 
and time period up to which it is subjected to those parameters. One of the major factors is surrounding 
temperature. The perishable demands to be kept in a temperature-controlled environment (Manouchehri et al. 
2020). Failing to maintain the required temperature may result in rapid degradation, spoilage, growth of 
pathogens which makes the produce inedible. Almost one-third of all the food produced for consumption is 
wasted. Such large amount of wastage is quite inadmissible considering overall growing population and land 
resource constraint.  
During the export of these perishables, the whole supply chain needs to be temperature controlled. This gives 
rise to the concept of cold chain export which involves application of a series of refrigeration steps along a 
supply chain so as to keep the perishables in desired temperature range (Mercier et al. 2017). Along with this, 
temperature inside the transport vehicles, refrigerated container and storage house should be monitored 
continuously. A lot of new wireless temperature monitoring technologies are available for the above-mentioned 
purpose. Various researches also have suggested the use of virtual temperature monitoring techniques like 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (Delele et al. 2013; Han et al. 2015; Pham et al. 2021). Prior knowledge of 
temperature condition of perishables can be helpful in predicting the quality and hence remaining shelf life of 
the perishables, in-transit as well as at the destination.   
The final stage of cold chain is distribution of produce to end consumers ones it reaches the destination. Cold 
chain management logistics also concerns with efficient distribution of produce at destination (Hsiao et al. 
2017). The perishable produces require temperature controlled warehouse and vehicles for storage and 
transportation (Keizer et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2019). These vehicles are generally more costly and consume more 
fuel than regular transport vehicles due to refrigeration equipment. Inclusion of these controls adds extra cost of 
road shipping, fuel expenditure for refrigeration and strict time limits to avoid excess quality deterioration 
(Mejjaouli and Babiceanu 2018; Wei et al. 2019). Furthermore, a single shipment may present large variations 
in quality among the produce, as different zones inside the refrigerated container are exposed to different 
surrounding conditions. A distribution plan must take into account the consumer requirement of food quality

The vehicle speeds and unit transportation cost are assumed to be constant for all the vehicles. The temperature 
and quality data are obtained from CFD simulation and Kinetic rate law model, respectively, as mentioned 
above. The minimum time of export from India to Singapore via seaways takes around 15 days, so the 
simulation is performed accordingly. The final quality data is calculated from extracted temperature taken 
(Figure 4) from the centre of mangoes at different locations inside the container is shown in Figure 4b.

Based upon the simulated data obtained, the quality levels of mangoes inside the container at the destination can 
be divided into three segments – quality level 1, 2 and 3, which constitutes mangoes having an overall quality 
value above 45%, from 35-45% and below 35% respectively. 
All these factors are incorporated into the mathematical model developed and solved, to obtain an optimal 
assignment of required quality mangoes to demand locations based upon the distance from source port as shown 
in Figure 5 and Table 5. All the algorithms developed are coded in python.

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
The growing concern about food quality and safety in the world market and its dependency on temperature, 
have led to challenging research on cold chain monitoring. Temperature needs to be continuously monitored to 
maintain the quality and increase the shelf life of the perishables. This study focusses on developing a 
comprehensive methodology for distribution planning for perishables by including its quality attributes decay

along the cold chain. With the case of export of an Indian mango variety namely ‘Kesar’, from India to 
Singapore, CFD simulations are performed. Various stages of cold chain namely harvesting, precooling, road 
and sea transport are simulated in order to obtain the temperature-time history throughout the cold chain. With 
the help of Kinetic rate law model, an overall quality in terms of percentage is calculated. A mathematical 
model is successfully developed which aims to generate an optimized distribution plan by minimizing the total 
cost of transportation, including the quality degradation. However, certain real situation issues including traffic 
congestion, multiple perishables in one vehicle have not been incorporated into the model. For further research, 
a multi objective problem can be considered which can include maximization of quality as well as minimization 
of cost. The traffic congestion can also be added as a constraint to obtain more realistic scenario for effective 
routing.

Abstract 
The global functioning of supply chains has exposed them to volatility and turbulence making them vulnerable to 
disruptions. Resilience has become an important ability for supply chains that enhances event readiness and aids 
recovery to a better operational state. The restoration of supply chains ensures business continuity and improves 
performance against the firms whose supply chains are not resilient. The importance of resilience towards supply 
chain and firm’s performance has resulted in several studies on its analysis. The literature is replete with studies 
analyzing antecedents of resilience and their effect on supply chain performance amidst disruptions. Despite the 
abundance of the empirical literature, only a few have examined the resilience antecedent configurations to assess 
supply chain performance. Even fewer studies have examined the necessity and sufficiency conditions of these 
configurations. Limited research evidence exists in the context of global supply chains having partners in India. The 
present study explores the antecedents of resilience influencing supply chain performance amidst disruptions. 
Furthermore, the study aims to obtain the necessary and sufficient configurations of these antecedents for enhancing 
supply chain performance and provide managerial suggestions. Therefore, the research questions are (1) What are the 
antecedents of resilience that may impact the supply chain performance amidst disruptions? (2) What configurations 
of resilience antecedents can explain the supply chain performance? The research question are solved via following 
methods: Firstly, based on literature review and expert interviews, the antecedents of resilience are obtained for Indian 
supply chains. Furthermore, Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) is utilized to obtain necessary and 
sufficient configurations of the antecedents that can explain supply chain performance amidst disruptions. The output 
of fsQCA software reveals the presence of multiple, equally effective configurations of causal factors that exist for 
explaining the interplay of antecedents towards enhancing supply chain performance amidst disruptions. 
Keywords  
Supply chain resilience, fsQCA, supply chain performance, disruptions and configurations. 
1. Introduction
An element of risk surrounds the functioning of supply chains as they operate in the turbulent and volatile global 
business environment (Agarwal and Seth, 2021). Managers have to strive to not only reduce the vulnerability of supply 
chains towards the elements of risk but also work towards responding and recovering operations if a disruption strike. 
Resilience is an important ability that enables the supply chains to anticipate, adapt, respond and recover promptly 
from unpredictable events (Ali et al., 2017). A resilient supply chain is perceived to absorb disturbances, restore its 
function and “bounce back” from adversity while maintaining a competitive advantage against the supply chains that 
are not resilient (Agarwal et al., 2022). Therefore, it is vital to identify its antecedents and work upon them to enhance 
the resilience of supply chains (Rajesh, 2017). These antecedents are called enablers and are the building blocks of 
resilience which must be implemented into practice. The enablers have a positive influence on the risk mitigation 
environment of supply chains and function in the different phases that a supply chain experiences while encountering 
disruptions (Hsu et al., 2021). The enablers enhance the resilience of supply chains during disruptions and 
consequently ensure business continuity, prevents the decline in the performance and ensure competitive advantage

of those explaining medium/low performance. These solutions also boast high level of consistency and coverage 
values which also validates their statistical significance. The consistency values depict the strength of the solution and 
represent the degree to which the relationship can be approximated. The consistency values for all the solutions is 
above the threshold of 80%. The coverage values evaluate the empirical evidence of the configuration. it gives the 
extent to which the performance can be determined from the existing configuration. These values are closer to the 
threshold which gives satisfactory explanation of the solution. 
 
Understanding the factors that affect assessment outcome, as well as their interrelationships, could contribute to the 
sufficient explanation and interpretation of the obtained high or medium/low performance. The existing research is 
replete with analysis of resilience enablers and their linkages with supply chain performance amidst disruptions. These 
studies give limited explanation about configurations of resilience enablers that are necessary and sufficient for 
achieving a superior supply chain performance. The present study employs fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis 
(fsQCA) to arrive at these configurations of resilience enablers that equally effectively explain superior supply chain 
performance. Moreover, the multiple equally effective configurations using fsQCA helps in resolving two constraints 
of cost and inter-relatedness of enablers that is faced by managers while attempting to make the supply chains resilient. 
The configurations obtained are equally effective implying that either of them can be chosen for implementation. The 
managers can select the configuration based on the cost (or any other specification) and enhance the resilience of their 
supply chains. The analysis is performed for the supply chains of Indian automobile industry which functions amidst 
high turbulence, involves global partners and, hence, are vulnerable to disruptions. The importance of Indian 
automobile industry for several global supply chains is important which makes study of resilience in this context a 
very important investigation. Six solutions are obtained from the analysis which depict different combinations of 
resilience enablers in the context of supply chains of Indian automobile industry. It is noted that several configurations 
involve the interplay of different enablers (solution 1, solution 2, solution 5 and solution 6) while some of them involve 
single resilience enabler that can make supply chain resilient even when other enablers are absent. Hence, managers 
can work towards either a single enabler or combinations of enablers for enhancing the resilience of their supply chain 
with equal effectiveness.  
 
5. Conclusions 
The obtained configurations may be validated using variance-based techniques to gain a complementing insight into 
the linkages between the enablers and supply chain performance. The present study has a limitation of using a small 
sample which may be increased for obtaining more complex and important configurations which might have been 
missed. The threshold values used in the present study may also be varied to obtain different configurations which 
might have escaped the analysis. Future studies may also study supply chains of other industry and country contexts 
and combine the findings for a generalised framework for supply chain resilience.

Abstract 
Agriculture is the backbone of India as it is the source of food as well as one of the factors of economic 
development. The agriculture sector's contribution to the Indian economy is much higher than the world's 
average. Agriculture has several stages, such as soil preparation, crop selection, control of pests or insects, crop 
yield, and crop sales. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the very emerging areas in the computer field. 
Applying AI in farming is now essential to increase crop production. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep 
Learning (DL) are sub-areas of AI. Though ML and DL follow their learning strategies. This paper gives an 
outline of ML and DL concerning agriculture. This paper also studies on comparison of ML and DL models 
with results. The majority of DL models are outperforming ML models. ML and DL are also applied in several 
other domains like medical, agriculture, business, transport (logistics), entertainment, education, and many 
more.

1.Introduction
India is one of the largest and oldest countries practicing farming for livelihood and also contributing 18% to the 
GDP of India. Farmers of India are facing a lot of problems at various stages of farming, starting from soil 
preparation to crop harvesting. Some problems can be solved by Artificial Intelligence. The requirement of 
Artificial Intelligence in Indian agriculture is essential to feed new information and increase the number of 
backend databases, it is used to accurately perform the tasks such as predictions of the crop, crop yield, weed 
detection, disease/pest detection, smart irrigation, etc. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a leading and emerging 
research area in the computer domain. The word AI was coined by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference 
in 1956 (Crevier 1993), defined as the science and engineering of making Intelligent Machines. The term 
artificial intelligence is applied when a machine mimics cognitive functions that humans associate with other 
human minds, such as the learning and problem-solving approach (Ongsulee 2017).  
The central goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing, 
perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. As AI evolved in the mid-1950, it has popularized in 
the early 2000 (S. D. Erokhin 2019) because of the availability of high-speed processors (CPU), Graphical 
Processing units, huge infrastructure, like a cloud environment, and good analytical procedures.  Figure 1 is 
about the latest high-speed processor; Figure 2 is about the latest Graphical Processing Unit (GPU). Figure 1 is 
the comparison of various latest CPUs with respect to cores, threads, and processing speed. Figure 2 is a 
comparison of various latest CPUs with respect to memory bandwidth and base clock speed. These latest CPU 
and GPU data are taken from various sources on the internet. These latest CPUs and GPU help to analyze the 
data efficiently and accurately.

that, Parallel RCNN, performed well in the detection of fruit. For the quality of fruit, Parallel RCNN has 
performed with 82.1%. 
 
Analysed classification with different CNN hybrid models, such as CNN-ELM, CNN-KNN, CNN-GA, MLP-
CNN, CNN-SVM, CNN-RNN, and CNN-LSTM. Classification done by CNN-LSTM gave 99% accuracy for 
hand written digits and breast cancer images (Suganthi and Sathiaseelan, 2020). A hybrid model 
approach(SVM+LSTM+RNN) (Agarwal and Tarar 2020) predicts crop yield based on factors of soil, PH and 
etc., given accuracy of 97%,when compared to the existing hybrid model(DT+ANN+RF) with an accuracy of 
93%. A machine learning in precision agriculture, Decision Tree Ensemble has given an accuracy of 94.2% in 
comparison to the baseline colour analysis method which has given accuracy of 89.6% (Treboux and Gen 2018).  
 
Deep learning models performed better in disease and weed detection (Sharma et al. 2021) and outperform 
machine learning models in precision agriculture for different tasks such as soil properties and weather 
prediction, crop yield prediction, disease, and weed detection, drip irrigation, and livestock production, and 
management, and intelligent harvesting. In machine learning in agriculture (Liakos et al. 2018), various machine 
learning models are reviewed for various agriculture applications like crop management, yield prediction, and 
disease detection. 
 
Datasets help to identify suitable ones for research or project tasks (Lu et al. 2020) consideration of different 
datasets, which are 15 datasets on weed detection, 10 datasets on fruit detection, and 9 datasets on other 
applications. For deep learning-based techniques, which apply to various agriculture problems, such as disease 
detection, fruit classification, and fruit counting. And the majority of deep learning techniques surpass 
conventional machine learning techniques (Santos et al.2020). Statistical methods play a crucial role while 
considering the features of datasets. Comparison of regular statistical methods and machine learning methods 
with strengths (Kocian et al. 2020). 
 
Classification methods (Mhaske et al. 2020) to the identification of fruit quality through RGB (Red Blue Green) 
and HSV(Hue Saturation Value) for classification based on fruit colour, fruit texture, and shape. A process for 
quality evaluation (classification) (Bhargava et al. 2018) of fruits and vegetables using computer vision, it 
describes the entire systematic procedure with various phases starting from pre-processing, segmentation, 
feature extraction, at end classification based on colour, size, texture, shape by using algorithms, such as 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multi-class Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, etc. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Both Machine Learning and Deep Learning help to develop intelligent machines, which are useful to predict or 
detect output.ML and DL methods are necessary to apply in agriculture to gain profit by producing more yield. 
Though ML and DL are sub-areas of AI, the followed procedure is different. Compare to conventional ML 
models, DL models outperform in the majority of tasks like classification, detection, etc., with better accuracy. 
Depending on requirements of user, one can choose ML or DL. However, deep learning algorithms can be 
overkill for less complex problems because they require access to a vast amount of data to be effective.It means 
that the task with small datasets ML, and huge datasets DL is preferable.

Abstract 
While considering the phenomenon of Productivity and Resource Efficiency, the first thing which comes to mind is 
the tools and techniques to achieve these parameters. One of those sets of tools is called lean tools and it helps in 
streamlining organizational processes. Lean supply chain is not limited exclusively to the companies who are into 
product manufacturing but for the businesses and firms whose focus is to eliminate waste and remove non value 
adding elements from the supply chain. In this paper, we are aiming at identifying the importance of lean tools and 
focusing on finding their significance in the day-to-day supply chain of the firms. We are also doing an overview of 
the impact of lean tools on the Human Resources of the firms. For this study purpose, we are using the Delphi 
technique with a lean-oriented survey to get insights from lean professionals.

1. Introduction
Lean is an industrial phenomenon that enriches customer benefits by eliminating waste and continuously improving 
a system with the application of lean practices, techniques, and principles. The central attention on lean experiments 
and research was a single company with no extension to the complete chain of supply. The time when the lean 
terminology is tried across the complete supply chain, it is referred to as lean supply chain. The main purpose of 
such a study is to generate a structure from theoretical knowledge and practicing lean in supply chain management, 
which can increase understanding of the field. Lean in the supply chain as a supply chain management strategy aims 
at applying the lean concepts to the whole functions within the entire supply chain members: suppliers, local 
organizations, distributors, and customers. From the literature review and the case study, it is found that researchers 
and practitioners view lean in the supply chain as a transformation process in the entire process which results in a 
transformed and competitive phenomenon called the lean supply chain. Lean supply chain is linked to the benefits 
like improvement in quality, reduction in cost, improvement in delivery, higher flexible model, shortage reduction, 
etc. This is differentiated through a conventional supply chain with the attributes like long-term relationships with 
suppliers, efficient communication channel, information shared platform, integrated members, continuously 
improving nature, etc. These change and transforming benefits are related to the execution of lean practices and 
techniques in supply chain management. This cannot be done without rigorous and normal process flow in the 
execution of lean in the supply chain management. The selection and flow of execution of lean techniques depends 
on suitable situations, familiar nature, and preference. In terms of exploration of HRM practices, managers play a 
decisive role in implementation of these practices by providing adequate atmosphere to foster the commitment 
towards workforce (Benkarim and Imbeau, 2022). The key outcomes of the studies suggests that there is significant 
and positive relationship between Organization culture, Lean manufacturing and HRM as drivers of SCM and TQM, 
also these entities have affirmative association with process innovation (Arshad et al., 2020). Due to its focused 
areas, this study gives summarized understanding about lean in supply chain and its behavioral impact on the human

internal awareness, acceptance, and understanding of LSCM strategy with an aim of mutual efficiency improvement 
by triggering the adoption of an internal strategy by moving forward in a digital transition toward LSCM. (Núñez-
Merino et al., 2020). As per the knowledge obtained from experts, logistical coordination plays a vital role in 
implementing a lean supply chain. Whereas, Value stream mapping is the area in which lean application can be 
proved crucial in obtaining better productivity. Talking about the impact on Human Resources, a lean tool makes the 
workforce more accuracy driven and brings better clarity to process-to-process operations. Human Resources are a 
source of competitive advantage, and HRM practices are critical to a company’s transformation. Transitioning to 
Lean is more likely to fail if changes in business functions are not supported by changes in HRM practices. 
(Benkarim and Imbeau 2022). Though Lean tools and Practices have been used widely in the digital technology 
environment, they now can help stakeholders and managers to generate more value streams for customers. Also, a 
digital Lean Supply Chain that faces a risk is a scope for future experimental simulation research and optimization 
(Reyes et al., 2021). The Lean SCM implementation focuses on the regularity of the production demand and cost of 
production using low-cost raw materials and has standard quality (Ariadi et al. 2021). Lean production becomes 
""social lean production,"" in which people-centered HRM techniques are incorporated in WISEs' (Work Integration 
Social Enterprises) social mission and the unique qualities of human resources (e.g., in the case of employee 
involvement). Considerations such as institutional and market factors are also important (Signoretti and Sacchetti, 
2020). The synergistic and complementary effect between Information and Digital Technology (IDT) of the industry 
4.0 and Lean Supply Chain Management (LSCM) is strong and has an enormous impact on Supply Chain (Núñez-
Merino et al. 2020). Lean Supply Chain System (SCS) improves financial performance with better optimization 
through a customer-integrated approach (Ariadi et al. 2021). In the effort of maximizing the positive effect of lean 
practices implementation on quality, organizations should focus on three aspects- Continuous quality improvement, 
Material flow management, and Waste management (Chakraborty and Gonzalez, 2018). Lean-driven sustainability 
tools have a great deal of untapped potential which is yet to be discovered. A more integrated approach in terms of 
channels and technology is needed to explore new horizons (Tasdemir and Gazo, 2018). 
 
6. Conclusion 
To conclude this paper, our study objective of gathering insights about lean in supply chain and to study its impact 
insights on human resources has been achieved and we have identified crucial factors influencing these lean 
operations in organizations. As per objective, we have listed down the focus areas for enhancing operations and 
human resource domains through lean practices. Further we are expanding this study into combining the lean 
benefits with the concepts of circular economy to develop a sustainable and green supply chain with lean 
functionalities.

Abstract 
Thin wall parts distort due to redistribution of unbalanced residual stresses after material removal. This distortion is 
due to generation of bending moment on parts during material removal. Prismatic slender AA2014 models were 
analyzed by transient thermal analysis and structural analysis with finite element software for geometric distortion 
against nominal dimensions by incorporating solution treatment properties and then initial stresses and strains into 
the analysis model for achieving T6 condition. Subsequently, the model was prepared by reducing it to 90% of pre-
stresses to simulate stretched model conditions to map with T651 condition. Subsequently, total deformation was 
analyzed by material removal using birth and death technique for T651 condition models by incorporation of 
proportional stresses and strains, by applying correction factor, were evaluated in physical experiment by slitting 
method strain gauge method. Simulation experiments were carried out with corrected model to evaluate total 
deformation by layer removal.  Deformation results were used for statistical analysis to study the effect of 
geometrical parameters on distortion trend. It is found that length of the part has significant effect on distortion. This 
analysis is useful for designing of prismatic slender parts for considering geometry effect on distortion of AA2014 
T651, which can be a guide during design for incorporating reinforcements to minimize distortion after material 
removal.

1. Introduction
Thin wall geometry parts made of AA2014-T651 are used in structural applications of avionic systems due to its 
unique characteristics like light weight and electric conductivity, its raw material mechanical properties of AA2014 
are improved by solution treatment, but residual stresses are increased due to sudden quenching, which are then 
processed by stretched stress relieving and artificial ageing. Chetalin et al.(2011)stated as the interactions between 
existing component flaws, in-service loading conditions, and internal residual stresses typically determine how long 
a structural part will last when used in aerospace. The residual stresses (RS) may be advantageous or detrimental for 
the component depending on their nature, distribution, or magnitude; neither outcome is assured. Depending on the 
specific situation, the residual stresses may be insignificant or important. The residual stresses are always increased 
by each of the several manufacturing procedures used to create components, leading to a final distribution that 
affects the mechanical characteristics and results in dimensional and geometrical deviations for the part features. 
Chetalin et al.(2011) investigated distortions caused by residual stresses in work parts using AA7050-T7451 thin 
wall parts. They concluded that the initial residual stresses in raw materials have an effect on the deformation of the 
final part. Machining-induced residual stresses have a particularly large impact on part distortion in thin monolithic 
aerospace components. All of these factors influence the final distribution of residual stresses, which influences 
component distortion. According to Gao et al. (2017) the distortion caused by the initial RS in the machining 
process can cause a number of issues, including increased production time and component costs. These distortions 
also reduce component service life and may result in the parts being scrapped entirely. As a result, RS measurement

Physical component deformation is 79.8% ≈ 80% of predicted deformation in FEM model and Regression equation. 
Hence deformation can be predicted using proposed FEM model. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The following conclusions can be drawn by the analysis of distortion on slender prismatic thin wall part using FEM 
model and statistical models. 
• Residual stresses in AA2014-T651 properties were achieved by using FEM model and simulation in order to 
estimate the deformation. 
• Minimum principal stress mainly depends upon length and width combination of raw material and its 
contribution is 31.75%. 
• Deformation can be estimated using regression model equation in AA2014-T651 by considering geometrical 
parameters and residual stress.  
• Deformation can be predicted using correction factor by comparing physical components using minimum 
principal stresses through FEM model. 
• Deformation mainly depends on internal stresses as compared with geometrical parameters. 
• This Deformation model can be used as a guide for providing ribs at appropriate places to avoid distortion during 
design stages. 
• Deformation can be decreased by reducing length, width and providing ribs in the slender prismatic thin wall 
parts.  
• The predicted simulation model is 80% accurate.

Abstract 
A delivery employee in E-Commerce industry carrying bulky logistics backpack on their shoulder to deliver the 
item to the right destination in scheduled duration. Their body muscles are subjected to constant strain when 
executing last-mile delivery. The objective of this study is to investigate Erector spinae muscles subjected to high 
loading while walking over a flat surface. The impacts of the varying weight of the logistics backpack were studied 
for activation by muscle. Walking speed at 1.11 m/s with no load, 10kg, 20 kg and 30kg was maintained by twelve 
healthy adult male participants. Response of Erector spinae (ES) muscles, longissimus (LO), and iliocostalis (IC) 
have been measured for sEMG. With increasing load conditions determined by one-way ANOVA. The mean surface 
electromyography (sEMG) for ES muscle activation was found not statistically significant while walking over the 
flat surface on a higher load. When comparing the muscles of both sides of the erector spinae, LO and IC, a 
statistically significant change was observed while walking with a weight of 10kg (p = 0.0001), 20kg (p = 0.0001), 
and 30kg (p = 0.00003).Among last-mile delivery employees, normalized sEMG activation in the ES muscles is 
found statically significantly within muscle groups while carrying a backpack load condition.

1. Introduction
During the COVID-19-induced lockdown, the role of the gig economy was clearly visible, with significant growth 
in E-commerce. With increasing demand in the E-commerce industry, there is demand for delivery workers. As a 
result, the gig economy has been popular among occupational workers in India. Small pick-up trucks are used for 
delivery of parcels with large weight and volume, while for the inner-city centers with high population density; two-
wheelers are used to deliver parcels with a logistics backpack. Various factors in occupational jobs are responsible

6. Conclusion 
In this study investigation was done over EMG activation of muscle group of ES under the influence of varying load 
conditions of logistics backpack while walking over flat surface. It was found that the no significance of load over 
LO and IC with the increased load but it was noteworthy that variation in muscles activity was observed during 
walking with weights mostly among the left longissimus as compared with the right side. Future research can 
explore the effects of strain rate on various other muscle groups like the upper back, shoulder, and lower limb 
muscles. It will benefit in providing support in the modification and better designing logistic backpacks. It will help 
in developing better lumbar extensor strengthening exercises to increase the endurance of last-mile delivery workers.

Abstract 
Global supply chains suffered considerable impact from the disruptions caused by the pandemic scenario and 
the need for efficient supply chain management is at an all-time high. Supply chain performance is strongly 
influenced by the inventory management policy adopted at each echelon. Thus, there is a requirement for an 
efficient inventory replenishment policy for supply chain environments undergoing frequent changes. The 
traditional static replenishment policies, omnipresent in industries, prove to be suboptimal in this case as the 
optimal replenishment policy depends on existing supply chain conditions. This work proposes a dynamic 
framework, inspired by a similar model identified in literature, which is able to find the optimal replenishment 
policy for a particular echelon in a three-echelon serial supply chain environment characterised by eight 
attributes. Supervised machine learning techniques were incorporated for developing the framework which is 
finally able to select and implement the optimal replenishment policy from four possible alternatives. The 
dynamic framework is developed using different machine learning algorithms, which further gives an insight 
into their performance. A comparative analysis of the proposed models is performed under two supply chain 
environments, namely the chaotic and the fast-changing. The results highlight the improvement obtained by 
considering the dynamic framework rather than the static alternatives. Additionally, the random forest (RF) 
based model was found to be the best performing model compared to its counterparts. Finally, the proposed 
model was observed to outperform the model identified from literature, thus portraying the significance of the 
work.

1. Introduction
Supply chains across the globe were exposed to unprecedented disruptions resulting in huge economic losses 
due to the present pandemic scenario. The COVID 19 associated disruptions have created a major global crisis 
by damaging global supply chains (Araz et al. 2020). The effect ranges from the development of a volatile 
market environment to an unpredictable economic system. Further, Handfield et al. (2020) reported an increase 
in bullwhip effect to an ever maximum in the manufacturing sector due to the pandemic situation. Lockdowns 
gave rise to labour force shortage and logistic disruptions and finally, a supply-side shock in food supply chains 
(Hobbs 2021). Thus, supply chain environments across the globe have suffered significant changes in recent

Figure 4. Performance comparison between best static and dynamic models 
 
In the proposed dynamic model, the performances of the algorithms in both scenarios are quite intuitive. The RF 
model outperformed its counterparts which could be associated with the efficiency of ensemble machine 
learning algorithms. Though works like Ni et al. (2020) reported of SVM having better accuracy and 
performance than other supervised ML algorithms (including RF), the RF model outperformed the SVM model 
for the present problem. The reason for this deviation could be associated to the fact that the performance of an 
algorithm on a dataset is affected by the kind of variables and number of instances of that dataset, which means 
that there can be no single algorithm that can outperform other algorithms in all datasets (Osisanwo et al. 2017). 
 
The robustness of the proposed model was verified using ANOVA techniques where the statistical significance 
of the proposed model was compared to the model identified from literature (Priore et al. 2019). The 
significance of the difference between the means was confirmed by the p value which was identified to be lower 
than 10%. 
 
7. Conclusions and Scope of Future Work 
The pandemic scenario has created a volatile market environment characterised by frequent changes in the 
supply chain environment which have forced industries to better manage their inventory. The traditional static 
alternatives would prove to be suboptimal under such changing conditions, which is attained by changing the 
values of eight attributes considered in this study. As shown in Figure 1, the lowest value of the J metrics 
(evaluation metrics) is observed in different order policies according to the varying conditions. Lowering the J 
metric value directly corresponds to a reduction in operating costs. Thus, a dynamic framework which is able to 
identify the best policy considering the varying conditions of the operating environment will perform better than 
a static policy applied throughout without considering various internal and external factors. This concept was 
successfully proven by the study conducted in this work.  
 
Further, the proposed dynamic framework for a three-echelon supply chain was compared with a similar model 
by Priore et al. (2019) from literature and with the traditional static order policies. The result proved the success 
of the proposed model in managing the echelon under consideration compared to the alternatives. All the 
dynamic models outperformed the static alternatives which again cements the argument that a dynamic model 
offers better performance. The proposed model surpassed the similar model from literature as the former bears 
more similarity between its training dataset and the comparing environment. In addition to that, the proposed 
model also considered the inventory position as an attribute, which was not accounted for in Priore et al. (2019). 
Among the models implemented using different ML algorithms, RF model outperformed the models developed 
using decision tree and SVM. This could be due to the efficiency of ensemble models and the characteristics of 
the training dataset. 
 
In real-life scenarios, the conditions are probably more dynamic which can result in the obsolescence of 
extracted knowledge. This point towards the need for careful examination and updating of the existing 
knowledge acquired through the decision tree model. In this direction, using dynamic knowledge refinement 
techniques is a suggested future work (Park et al. 2001). Also incorporating the network structure of the supply 
chain into the analysis is another direction for future research.

Abstract 
The main purpose of this paper is to study the critical success factors (CSFs) of the blockchain technology 
adoption in Accounting and bookkeeping which might be literally a first attempt and also propose a conceptual 
framework of an accounting model adopting the Blockchain technology, which will be promoting the 
combination of these two areas in the future. Acritical literature review of the blockchain technology, 
accounting, and blockchain based accounting was conducted to identify the most relevant factors of Blockchain 
adoption, followed by the model formulation with the help of interpretive structural modelling (ISM) consisting 
of CSFs and relationships between those based on experts’ views. In the study we have attempted to develop a 
contractual relationship among Trust, Resistance to Change, Scalability, Energy Consumption, Use of External 
Network, Perceived Cost, Data Immutability, Government Policy, Facilitating Conditions and Behavioural 
Intention to Adopt; with view of blockchain implementation in accounting. This study supports previous 
conceptual work on Blockchain Technology and accounting could serve as a starting point to assist in decision-
making.

1. Introduction
In India, the accounts and financial record-keeping has undergone tremendous changes. In the starting the 
financial records were maintained in written form termed as bahi-khata, these record keeping was a time taking 
activity and these were not that reliable as the records can be easily altered by anyone with access to the records 
even the legal reporting and the financial result calculation was long process. So, with the evaluation of 
technology the computerised system come to light these record keeping was fast and less time taking, and the 
reporting can be done quickly even the financial results can be obtained with few clicks (Zhang and Shah, 2023; 
Bellucci et al., 2022). But these computerised systems are also having some inherent limitation of chances of 
tempering and alteration of data (Turker and Bicer, 2020; Bonson and Bednárová, 2019). 
System for acquiring, categorising, sorting, interpreting and disseminating financial and quantitative data to 
decision-makers through computers is the accounting information system (Granlund 2003; Zhang and Shah, 
2023). In other words, it is a system that uses computers to transform accounting data into information and to 
manage the financial information of an entire organisation. For the most part, it serves as a repository for 
accounting data and a source of reference for those in charge of running the business and making strategic 
decisions. MIS (Management Information System) and EDP (Electronic Data Processing Accounting) make up 
the majority of modern accounting information systems (Aljarallah 2020; Kwilinski, 2019). A cloud computing 
platform involves a large investment of time and money, as well as a large amount of research and development 
(Yang 2021; Bonson and Bednárová, 2019). 
Even while other fields have seen significant changes as a result of technological advances, the digitalization of 
accounting systems is still in its infancy. Regulations governing authenticity and integrity, which are 
exceedingly strict, may be a contributing factor (Kwilinski, 2019; Tyma et al., 2022; Bonson and Bednárová, 
2019). To make counterfeiting as difficult as possible, the accounting system can use Blockchain technology to 
prevent it from happening in the first place. This can be accomplished through the employment of both mutual

8. Conclusion, Limitations, and direction for future scope 
The study is focused on identifying the critical success factors important to lead effective adoption and 
application process of Blockchain technology in the area of accounting and bookkeeping. This study used the 
ISM methodology to develop a hierarchical model, which provides contextual, hierarchy and interpretive 
relationship between the variables and factors identified to be crucial. The finding reveal that Data Immutability 
and Government Policies have the most significant impact on Intention to adopt the blockchain technology in 
accounting and bookkeeping, followed by facilitating conditions and scalability. Whereas Use of External 
Network and Resistance to change are the factors those are dependent of other factors of the study. Therefore, 
this research contributes to the literature of blockchain implementation by knowledge and information that can 
be helpful to other researchers to access literature for reference in their future research studies in the area of 
blockchain implementation in accounting and bookkeeping context. 
 
Limitations of the research were unavoidable in any research procedure. As this is a techno behavioural study, 
so the responses were based on the respondents' perceptions; but, as time passes and technology advances, 
people's attitudes on blockchain technology adoption in the field of accounting and bookkeeping may shift. 
Future research in this area has a lot of potential, because the adoption of blockchain in the area of accounting 
and bookkeeping can enhance the accuracy, comparability, authenticity, transparency, trust can reduce the risk 
alteration and duplication of work. The research model created here can be further verified through the 
quantitative study. The study can further be explored with the respondent as corporate and business and 
government officials.

Abstract 
Online learning and teaching are becoming the new normal around the world after the Covid-19 pandemic. 
However, the lack of facilitates, infrastructure and other factors posing challenges to many urban and rural students 
and teachers on smooth and effective running of online classes. The present study aims to analyse the challenges in 
remote/online learning as a comparative study among urban and rural students and teachers. The study focuses on 
understanding the different challenges to mitigate them through suggesting real-time and cost-effective solutions 
thereby enhanced online learning and teaching experience. Questionnaire Survey is administered in the study to 
collect the data. Convenience Sampling is used to select the sample. Factor analysis, regression analysis and 
independent sample t-test are conducted to achieve the objectives of the study. Results indicated that the rural 
students and teachers faced more challenges compared to urban areas due to the lack of access to resources and 
financial constraints to buy online learning platforms like mobile phone, laptop etc. But challenge like lack of 
interaction were faced more or less same by both rural and urban area students. The importance of some common 
facilities that appeared to be the need for both rural and urban students and teachers, to improve the effectiveness of 
online teaching and learning is explored through this study.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus was declared a global epidemic by 2020, and several regions accepted distance from each 
individual as a means of eradicating the problem (Paulo et al, 2020). Indeed, many countries throughout the world 
have decided to close schools across the country in order to prevent the virus from spreading and disrupting the 
education of millions of students. The Corona virus has tainted the school educations and cultural processes over the 
world (Osman, 2020)). Technology has the potential to help in this aspect. Online learning is a sort of education that 
is offered through the use of a computer or other digital devices. It can be seen of as a kind of learning assistance 
because it allows students to finish their studies at any time being anywhere in the world. Online education has 
various advantages, including the opportunity to learn from anywhere, the flexibility to choose, and the cost savings, 
especially transporting and other related costs (Suri, 2021).  
The criticality of online learning has increased as a result of the worldwide health crisis. It enables students to 
communicate with their teachers and peers even when they are not in class (Melissa Bond, 2020). However, there 
are still a number of difficulties that can arise when adopting this style of instruction. Many governments and 
researchers agree that socially disadvantaged groups confront substantial hurdles when it comes to accessing online 
learning. Concerns regarding the rising disparity between rich and poor have been more prominent as a result of the

teachers. In order to overcome this challenge, it is suggested that there should be some activities where questions 
should be raised from the students itself, activities like pick and speak, content writing, debate’s related to their 
education background, paper presentation, webinars towards mental health etc. Such activities motivate to involve 
themselves into the process and shape themselves. Further, the research revealed that many students regrets that they 
do not have practical exposure towards the theoretical concepts and labs. It is recommended that students should be 
given space to work on the related case studies with respective to their domain, which helps the students to learn 
practically. In addition to this, it enhances the student engagement as well. Weekly catch ups should be done to 
discuss about the case which helps students to gain different perspective towards the case.  
 
Training and counselling sessions should be organized in the villages to motivate rural youths to join online learning 
courses. There should be more awareness campaigns among the rural community about new government programs 
and policies to keep them up to date, to improve their distance learning resources, and to access data to be learned. 
State governments can organize courses on how to provide online content for teachers. An electronic library should 
be provided in the villages to increase access to digital learning resources. Particular attention should be paid to the 
development of computer literacy and technology tools. Different methods of communication should be used to 
disseminate information on the availability of training courses online, free of charge or with a minimum certification 
fee on different platforms. Satellite can help close the ‘homework gap’ for students in many rural areas Satellite 
access can help, today for those students, parents and school districts on the other side of the digital divide, waiting 
for fibre or cable is not practical and may be futile. Establishing learning centre at every village which can give 
access to study material to students via audio recordings, video recordings and text books etc. can reduce the 
challenges 
 
7. Limitations and Future Scope for Study 
The study used only questionnaire survey to collect the information and purely quantitative. Other data collection 
tolls such as focus group discussion, observation method, social media monitoring etc can be conducted to get more 
reliable data. Our research was mainly concentrated on teachers and students with a sample size of 50 teachers and 
196 students which can be extended more for better result. Research failed to study about the challenges faced by 
the parents to provide better education to their children’s which would have been more holistic study. Special 
consideration can be done by selecting particular Rural and urban areas of Karnataka and data can be compared to 
analyse the fact to overcome the challenge’s faced by the teachers and students. On the above-mentioned points 
researchers can come up with innovative methods to make teaching sessions interactive and efficient to overcome 
the challenges faced by the teachers and students.

Abstract 
Supplier selection (SS) is an important aspect of supply chain management (SCM) and appropriate supplier 
evaluation opens up a lot of opportunities for every organization. Simply looking for suppliers with the cheapest 
price is no longer considered ""efficient supplier selection"". Selection of a good set of suppliers is a multiple-criteria-
decision-making (MCDM) process. Despite the fact that earlier research has presented several methods and tools for 
effective supplier selection, only a few approaches have attempted to address issues of SMEs in supplier selection 
decisions. We proposed an integrated two-stage MCDM approach that consists of Analytical Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) and Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to Compromise Solution (MARCOS) for supplier 
selection problems of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). And the results are validated with the Technique 
for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). AHP & TOPSIS are widely researched and used 
for a long time but MARCOS is relatively new compared to them. This approach can be easily implemented using a 
spreadsheet program. This spreadsheet is useful in practical situations and does not require the user to have any prior 
knowledge of optimization. A real-life case is examined to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. 
The novelty of this study is that it presents a realistic, easy-to-implement, and proven supplier selection technique 
for SMEs to achieve sustainability.

1. Introduction
Business characteristics such as the global competitive environment, technological advancements, shorter product 
life cycles, and stringent service and quality requirements are the most important driving forces for companies to 
form medium to long-term strategic partnerships with innovative and sustainable suppliers to improve business 
performance and gain a strategic and competitive edge over their competitors (Rajhans & Barshikar, 2013). In 
addition, managing suppliers play an important role in SCM because the cost of raw materials and components is the 
principal cost of a product. The majority of manufacturing companies spend 60 to 80 percent of their revenue on 
procuring raw materials and components (P. Kumar et al., 2014). As a result, this study emphasizes on investigating 
the problem of sustainable supplier selection (SSS) using various Multi-Criteria Decision making (MCDM) 
approaches and developing a practical approach for SS problem of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 
Selection of competent suppliers not only lowers purchasing costs but also contributes to product innovation and 
efficient manufacturing processes. Therefore, supplier selection is seen as an important issue in SCM in order to 
maintain a competitive edge. Supplier selection (SS) is the process of identifying, evaluating, and contracting with 
suppliers (Taherdoost & Brard, 2019). The SS process starts with recognizing the need for a good

5. Conclusion and future research agenda. 
In the modern supply chain, traditional single-criterion method centered on the lowest cost is not sufficient. 
Although the literature on supplier selection has recommended a variety of tools and techniques for effectively 
evaluating suppliers, there has been no thorough evaluation of supplier selection models from SME's point of view. 
Furthermore, there is a dearth of studies in the literature that considered the limitations of SMEs.In view of this 
research gap, this research addressed the supplier selection issue of SMEs and revealed that SMEs can gain a 
competitive advantage if they follow the proposed method of supplier selection. A spreadsheet program is developed 
for professionals working in SMEs that will assist them in SS decision-making. In addition, the developed 
spreadsheet program is designed to incorporate the changes in criteria or sub-criteria very easily and the same 
change will be reflected in the entire program. Therefore the results can be generalized to any sector where different 
criteria or sub-criteria are of prime importance. The results of the case study conducted on a manufacturing company 
revealed that the proposed method and developed spreadsheet program are capable to alleviate supplier selection 
issues of SMEs.

Abstract 
Intermodal transportation has revolutionized the movement of goods in domestic and international trade. A vital 
role is played by inland intermodal terminals in hinterland connectivity of containerized intermodal movement. 
This study is aimed at identifying and examining various factors which define service quality and customer 
satisfaction for users of intermodal terminals. The stakeholders aim to understand these factors within limited 
resources and time. Therefore, ranking the factors is indispensable to increase the customer satisfaction at the 
inland intermodal terminals. In the present paper, the factors are graded by applying one of the multi-criterion 
decision-making (MCDM) practices recognized as the Best Worst Method (BWM).  This study intends towards 
addressing the research gap in service quality for intermodal terminals and suggest focus areas to improve 
service quality for the industry players.

1. Introduction
In the modern history, advent of containerization became revolution in international logistics. It brought safety, 
lesser handling, economy and unitization to the cargo which were earlier moving in loose condition and so were 
prone to handling and cargo safety issues leading to inefficiencies. Invented in USA in 1960s, following decades 
witnessed large scale adoption of containerization across supply chain and transportation modes. Shipping 
vessels, railcars, trucks and ports were standardized to enable seamless and smoother containerized transport of 
goods. Till date, many economies have seen unsurpassable surge in market share of containerized transport 
against bulk cargo. Today, share of intermodal railcars in total railcars originated in USA market is at all-time 
high, exceeding beyond 45% (American Association of Railroads, 2022). 
In India, the surge in market share for intermodal wagons (container wagons in Indian context) over total rail 
wagon has been meagre in comparison to other economies. Container wagons accounted for about 5.12% of the 
total tonnes originating on the state-owned Indian railways’ freight operations in FY2020-21(Indian Railways 
Yearbook, 2021). Indian railways joined the containerization revolution by institutionalizing the container 
business by incorporating Container Corporation of India or the CONCOR in year 1988(Indian Railways 
Yearbook, 2021). Indian railways also took many other initiatives like allowing private participation in 
container train operations through concessionaire arrangement, opening many commodities for container 
movement, so on and so forth.  With such initiatives, many public sector undertakings, Indian private players 
and multinational logistics services providers invested in intermodal infrastructure like inland intermodal 
terminals (called the Inland Container Depots, ICD in India), container trains and ancillary services(Gangwar, et 
al., 2010). Based on our survey of current market. there are about 14 public and private container train

Abstract 
Diversity and Inclusion is gaining attention across the globe. People with disabilities (PWDs) formulate an 
important diversity group. The organizations are consistently aiming at forming inclusive workplaces for PWDs. 
Building inclusive workplace is highly aimed at effective interactions between the workforce with and without 
disabilities, top management’s involvement and PWD employee’s perception of inclusion.  This study proposes an 
in-depth analysis of challenges of inclusion of PWDs. The two phased study commences with extensive literature 
review and identification of challenges of inclusion of PWDs. These challenges are divided into seven categories 
and further subcategories. In the second phase, Best Worst Method (BWM) is applied to rank the identified 
challenges. This study focuses on the effective investigation and prioritization of challenges in building inclusive 
workplaces.

1. Introduction
Globalization has changed the way businesses operate all across the world, particularly in India, resulting in a shift 
in discourse and discussions regarding diversity and inclusion among Indian enterprises. Organizations are 
rigorously working on Diversity and Inclusion issues (Thomas, 2004). There are regular efforts to include women, 
culturally diverse people, minorities and much attention is levied on including people with disabilities (PWDs) in 
work environment. Organizations are increasing inclusion initiatives and efforts to provide adequate diversity and 
inclusion environment. They believe that it helps in increasing work efficiency and satisfaction. A workplace that 
values people's diversity as well as their individuality, removes barriers to full engagement, and fosters a sense of 
inclusion (Holvino et al., 2004; Robersonet al., 2006).

Abstract 
Air conditioning has become a vital part of our day to day lives, but with the current cooling solutions there are 
concerns regarding to high energy consumption and emission of dangerous gases depleting the ozone layer. An 
evaporative cooling system (ECS) is considered as one of the oldest and low-cost cooling systems. However, the 
temperature drop in ECS is low and hence in this work, a multistage cooling system was developed and tested for its 
performance. This system consists of indirect and direct evaporative cooling system.  The combination of indirect and 
direct ECS reduces the dry bulb temperature significantly.  The experimental results show that the temperature drop 
in two stage is higher than the single stage. It is also observed that the energy consumed by this system is low as 
compared to conventionally used HVAC system. From this work, we conclude that the multistage evaporative cooling 
system can be used as an alternative to the HVAC system for commercial and industrial applications.

1. Introduction
Energy demand worldwide for buildings cooling has increased sharply in the last few decades, which has raised 
concerns over depletion of energy resources and contributing to global warming.  It is suggested that the climate 
change mitigation policies could increase demand for resources perceived as critical, because these are used in many 
renewable energy technologies. The phasing out fossil fuels has the potential to reduce both the supply potential (i.e. 
primary flow) and recoverable resources (i.e. stock) of materials (Månberge et al. 2021,  Endang et al. 2019, Kumar 
and Majid 2020).  The ASEAN region as a whole is relatively well endowed with various energy resources however 
the energy resources are not evenly distributed. As the population and energy demand continues to increase and 
existing fuel supplies begin to run out, most ASEAN countries will have to find ways to tackle their country energy 
security (Kongre et al. 2015, Hussain et al. 2016). The primary objective for deploying renewable energy in India is 
to advance economic development, improve energy security, improve access to energy, and mitigate climate change. 
Sustainable development is possible by use of sustainable energy and by ensuring access to affordable, reliable, 
sustainable, and modern energy for citizens (Model Project Report on Fruit and Vegetable Processing Unit National 
Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development 2014,  Libertya et al. 2013).   
It is suggested that India is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world and the wastage of fresh 
horticultural produce is about 18 % (Deoraj et al. 2015). The ECS can be used as a short term preservation of fruits 
and vegetables, because it reduces the storage temperature and increases the relative humidity of the air which keeps 
the fruits and vegetables fresh (Amit 2016). The integration of ECS with good sanitation will help to attain high quality 
level of freshness for some period (Cayli et al, 2021, Kowalski et al. 2020).

Figure 18. Speed vs Pressure Drop 
 
Figure 18 depicts the graph between speed in rpm and pressure drop in mm of H2O. As the blower speed varies from 
1800 to 3000 rpm. In IEC curve, as the speed changes, the pressure drop varies ranging from 3.9mm to 8.7mm, while 
in the IDEC curve, in comparison with IEC it raises further up to 10mm due to the addition of another stage. The ECS 
with multistage results in higher pressure drop as compared to the single stage ECS.  
 
6. Conclusion 
There is a need to develop environmentally friendly low cost ECS. The multistage ECS is an efficient and eco-friendly 
cooling solution. It has high application in dry and torrid regions and can be used in a variety of fields. The first stage 
is an indirect ECS where heat exchanger designed in such a way that there is no contact between air and water, hence 
there is no increase in humidity and sensible heat transfer occurs, due to which this stage is preferable in regions where 
humidity is high. The second stage is direct ECS where the heat exchanger has direct contact with water and the air 
passing through this is cooler and contains little more moisture as compared to the first stage. Therefore, IDEC system 
has a huge scope of application in industrial and commercial buildings as it reduces temperatures to a level that 
provides thermal comfort while the humidity also is maintained. The multistage ECS consumes 25% less energy 
compared to vapour compression refrigeration system thus making it a preferable and feasible option.

Abstract 
Modern households are becoming automated with the development of smart cleaning robots applied in many 
fields with the known environment itself only because of difficulty in analyzing unknown paths, the cleaning 
robot due to its semi-autonomous nature cannot be monitored without the presence of human interference. The 
purpose of the project is to disinfect the floor in households, colleges, hospitals, etc., fully autonomously for 
delivering convenience and reducing time spent by developing a prototype model of a floor disinfecting robot 
using artificial intelligence. The proposed system initiates by designing a 3D model in the designing software for 
assembling the required components in the 3D printed hardware model. In an assigned path, turning ON of the 
device and UV LED strip for floor disinfecting are performed automatically using a supervised learning algorithm 
and scheduling program respectively. Appearance of obstacles within the path are detected and captured through 
external sensors and Pi camera for safety monitoring of the device. All the software and hardware operations of 
the device are tested and controlled by integrating with a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. For a user to get 
acknowledgment about the device performing tasks such as autonomous movement of the robot within the path, 
activation and deactivation of UV LED, obstacle detection is intimated to the user by sending an online message 
through a WhatsApp notification.

1. Introduction
A Robot is an electro-mechanical machine that is used for various purposes in industrial and domestic applications. 
Based on the application many home appliances from various industries have been developed. Initially, the main 
focus was on having a cleaning device. As time flies more improvements in robotic devices were made and more 
efficient electronic appliances were developed. Cleaning is an essential need of this generation. Basically, in 
colleges and hospitals for floor cleaning regularly different techniques are used to clean the different types of 
surfaces. The world today is governed by automation. When complex operations are made automated to simplify 
tasks, the benefits of automation can also be tapped to perform simple household tasks. One such task is cleaning. 
Cleaning, though undermined for its nature of work, is extremely vital. Cleanliness will get a healthy life.  
In recent years, robotic cleaners have taken major attention in robotics research due to their effectiveness in 
assisting humans in-floor cleaning applications at various places such as homes, hotels, restaurants, offices, 
hospitals, workshops, warehouses, universities, etc. The robotic cleaners are classified based on their cleaning 
expertise like floor mopping, dry vacuum cleaning, etc. Xiaomi, Realme, Dyson, etc., are the automatic cleaning 
robots used for the purpose of dry vacuuming and wet mopping that are existed in the present market. 
Earlier, many people used to take care of surfaces by using disinfectant tools such as hot boiling water, chlorine 
bleach, Ethanol isopropyl alcohol, microfiber cloth, disinfecting wipes, etc. Use of these leads to employing 
special servants, maids, or cleaning staff and may increase the cost of buying those disinfectant tools, and may 
increase workload. However, these traditional methods cannot be considered efficient methods for disinfection 
purposes instead use UV Light to kill various germs, bacteria, and viruses like covid, omicron, etc., and the 
environment sanitary can be done which was proven by WHO (World Health Organization) itself. So, making use 
of technical methods for purpose of disinfection by replacing conventional methods can be considered an effective 
method in terms of inactivation of infectious agents, cost, and workload.  
The main aim of the project is to develop a system in which the user’s workload is reduced by saving time due to 
the autonomous operation of the device from starting the disinfecting process to completion by designing a 
prototype model and assembling the essential components in the 3D printed model. Initializing and termination

6. Applications  
The Proposed Floor Disinfecting Robot is mainly designed for inactivation of germs, bacteria and virus through 
ultraviolet rays of UV LED Strip on any type of surfaces like Household, Hospitals, Malls, University buildings, 
Industries etc.,  
 
7. Conclusions  
In the proposed project, Design and Assembly of Time-Efficient Floor Disinfecting Robot using Artificial 
Intelligence has been implemented in which the device is designed and assembled with less weight and portable 
for easy to carry. Scheduling of the UV LED is provided in the device for performing the daily Routine task of 
Disinfection. Disinfecting by UV - C LED is considered for inactivation of virus and bacteria on surfaces. Time 
efficient is justified by defining specific length and width in the code in which the device follows and completes 
the assigned path by avoiding the repetition of disinfected area. Supervised Learning is a concept of AI which 
allows the device to classify the obstacles by capturing the images using computer vision technology with in the 
path and communicates with the user by sending WhatsApp notification about the classified images for virtual 
intimation of the path.

Abstract 
There are 1,6 million people work as security officers in Indonesia (Simamora  2020) . This job’s demand increases 
year by year along with the development and improvement of companies in Indonesia. To be a security officer, 
someone needs to gain at least Gada Pratama qualification. The mandatory of conducting security training before 
getting a job is stated in Police Chief Regulation (KAPOLRI  2020). Caraka Sakti Utama is one of official companies 
that conduct security training in West Java which has legal permit from Police Chief of Republic Indonesia. In Police 
Chief Regulation stated that only Police Institution of Education and companies whose Operational Permit from Police 
Chief are able to conduct security training.  There are 200 security training companies located in West Java that makes 
tight competition among companies. To attract more customers, Caraka Sakti Utama uses seven social media platforms 
dominantly Facebook. Based on the information above, this study is aimed to analyse the effect of Facebook social 
media communication, Brand Awareness and WOM to Purchase Intention of Caraka Sakti Utama’s new customers. 
This study uses Quantitative Method. Population of this study is prospective costumers who follow Caraka Sakti 
Utama’s Facebook account and contacted the company through Whatsapp messaging application. Sample of this study 
is 210 participants. Sampling Technique used in this study is simple random sampling. Data analysis technique used 
in this study is Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) with the help of Smart PLS 3.0 software. 
Keywords 
Social Media Marketing, Brand Awareness, Word of Mouth, Purchase Intention, and SEM PLS. 
1. Introduction
Caraka Sakti Utama is a security training company with a legal permit from the Indonesian Police Headquarter, 
Jakarta. Located in Subang, Cirebon, Purwakarta, and Jakarta, this company regularly conducts security training for 
the public on a monthly basis (Utama  n.d.). The participants are people who want to be security officers. As stated in 
National Police Regulation (KAPOLRI  2017), people who wants to become a security officer, he or she have to pass 
security training. Caraka Sakti Utama uses several social media platforms for their marketing purposes, such as 
Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp (WA) marketing, and email marketing to attract new customers. 
Among all their social media platforms, the reach and interaction (engagement) on Caraka Sakti Utama’s Facebook 
account has the highest number. Additionally, their Facebook communication brings the company the highest number 
of student enrolments compared to other companies that do not use social media platforms for their marketing tools.  
The number of participants who register at Caraka Sakti Utama is the highest number among other companies in every 
batch. This is predicted to happen as the impact of their Facebook communication. That being said, there has not been

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
This study was conducted on security training Caraka Sakti Utama in Indonesia. Number of 210 sample is taken from 
members of Caraka Sakti Utama Facebook fanpage, hance only members of this fanpage are included. Therefore a 
sampling bias may affect our findings. Other companies from different product may be investigated in the next 
research. Researchers should elaborate and add more variable in this model in the future to refine the model and 
deepen knowledge of social media’s influence on the factors leading purchase decision and conduct a research with 
same model but with another population in Indonesia.  
 
5.4 Validation 
Previous research stated by Jamali Khan that annoyance; viral Advertisement and Opinion Seeking don’t have any 
direct effect on the purchase intention of the consumer. But Brand page commitment has indirect effect on purchase 
intention; as well Brand Awareness and word of mouth have direct effect on Purchase intention (Jamali & Khan  
2018). Another result showed by Hutter the positive effects of consumers’ social media engagements on brand 
awareness, WOM activities and purchase intention are strong arguments for the relevance of social media in respect 
to the management of brands (Hutter et al.  2013)  
 
6. Conclusion 
Our findings represent that engagement with a Facebook fanpage has a positive effect on consumers’ Brand 
Awareness, Brand Page Commitment, Lack of Irritation and Purchase Intention. The results further indicate that the

Abstract 
There has been a rapid increase in the demand for electric vehicles across the globe and so are their stock prices. 
The companies, like TESLA and NIO, have seen a rise and fall in their stock prices over a period of time. 
Various models have been used by researchers/analysts in this field for the stock price prediction using 
econometrics models, deep learning techniques using LSTM, RNN, etc. The purpose of this paper is to predict 
the stock prices of these two electric vehicles (along with their stock closing prices). The econometric model, 
ARIMA (p, d, q) in particular, has been fitted to predict the stock prices of electric vehicles. The ARIMA (p, d, 
q) model helps in forecasting by converting the non-stationary data into stationary one using the differencing
technique. Further, with the help of the ML algorithms, the model appropriately uses the data (training data) and
then validates (testing data) in a fixed proportion. In this paper, we will predict the stock prices of electric
vehicles by extrapolating the data to a future time period and then compare the forecasting accuracy. In terms of
the managerial implications, the prediction is expected to help the case companies for better optional planning
and execution.
1. Introduction
The rise in the consumption of fossil fuels has caused several environmental concerns, causing temperature rise, 
melting of icebergs at both the poles, rising sea levels, etc. Usage of fossil fuels is limited and constrained but 
there is unlimited demand for them.  In this scenario, many automobile companies have started producing 
Electric vehicles replacing petrol and diesel vehicles. There has been a surge in the demand for EVs (electric 
vehicles). TESLA has become one of the largest EV-producing companies in the world causing a surge in its 
demand and stock. NIO a China-based EV maker has also risen as one of the competitors of TESLA in recent 
days. So, predicting the stock price of these companies will fetch numerous interesting outputs for the stock 
traders. Because of the uncertain nature of the stock market, predicting stock prices become difficult. To 
minimize the investment risk and make a profit, several forecasting techniques are used. Deep learning methods 
like long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to learn patterns from data and infer solutions from unknown data 
(Ghosh et al., 2004). For this paper Econometrics models like ARIMA has been used. ARIMA models are some 
of the widely used techniques in forecasting (Box and Jenkins., 1970) and have come well before machine 
learning-based models like LSTM. For short-term prediction of financial time series data, ARIMA modeling is 
efficient (Chatfield, 2000). It is an open model, it helps the researchers in understanding the nature of the dataset 
at each stage of the processing (Jagwani et al., 2018). This paper attempts to predict Closing stock prices using 
ARIMA, to analyze the prediction with the actual value. The datasets consist of 7 attributes, out of which we 
will be interested in predicting the closing price of the stocks as it defines the company’s trading performance 
on day to day basis whether the stock prices have gone up (Mahadik et al.,2021). TESLA and NIO stocks data 
from 10-12-2018 to 03-06-2022 have been taken for analysis and have been obtained from Yahoo finance. The 
total number of observations during this period is 878. Further, we split the data, training 80% and testing 20% 
into two parts. Training data helps in model building and then with the help of testing data we predict whether it 
fits the data for accuracy. While this section has introduced the paper, section II will briefly discuss the 
literature, section III is based on the methodology and the data pre-processing, section IV will discuss the result 
of the analysis. In the section V we will conclude with direction for future research.

5. Conclusion and direction for future research
This paper attempts to predict the future stock prices of TESLA and NIO using ARIMA. Using ARIMA 
modeling has been simple and the results have been promising. Further, more advancement can be done using 
SARIMAX, and various other ML (machine learning) algorithms like logistic regression, KNN, and Decision 
tree (CART), etc. The stock prices of companies depend upon current events, tweets, political news, and other 
factors. Hence, we can overcome these limitations by using Sentiment Analysis. Thus, we can develop a model 
which can be more accurate than the proposed model. Throughout the whole analysis and after forecasting the 
Closing prices for both TESLA and NIO, we observe that TESLA stock prices have been increasing at a fast 
rate than the NIO stock prices, whereas NIO has seen a plunge in its stock, which rings an alarm for NIO to do 
the several modifications required to be done. If TESLA keeps going with this increase in its stock prices, 
certainly it will give it more edge over its EV rivals like NIO and other companies globally.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of ISO implementation on higher education (HEI) performance 
as measured using review policy techniques and how sustainable is the implementation process. Primary data was 
obtained by distributing the questionnaire to selected universities in Karnataka. The independent variable of this study 
is the application of ISO principles, and the dependent variable is the university's outstanding achievements in terms 
of finance, customer perspective, internal business perspective, and learning and growth perspective and how 
sustainable it is. The results of data processing show that there is a positive impact on the application of ISO to 
educational institution performance from a financial perspective, a customer perspective, an internal business 
perspective, and a learning and growth perspective increase. Based on these results, the authors suggest that institutions 
apply ISO principles in managing their institutions to improve their performance and have a sustainable process.

Abstract 
The fast-growing IT/ consulting industry and evolving technology demands automating the recurring processes and 
thereby improvising the system efficiency. In organizations, recurring activities executed manually consume human 
efforts. Staffing management is one of those activities which play significant role in success of the project. Right 
availability of resource in right capacity for right duration is essential for staffing management. In some 
organizations, it is done by manually by using Microsoft Excel. To automate these processes major automation tools 
like Excel Macro, MS Automate are readily available. In this paper, the selection of automation tool using MCDM 
and application of tool to improvise and automate the process is explained in sufficient detail. The three constraints 
of effective program management are time, cost, and quality. The staffing management process is exhaustive, time 
consuming, lengthy, and increases the chance of occurrence of multiple errors. To make the process effective and 
efficient, it is necessary to reduce manual effort and hence automating staffing management process can be 
beneficial. The automation tool uses the Excel Macros (VBA) to identify the staffing of each resource. Therefore, 
the automation tools used in this paper helps in reducing human errors and determines the status of the staffing for 
each resource- overstaffed, understaffed, unaligned and optimally staffed. The outcome of the application of 
automation tool in program/ space management tool leads to effectiveness and improved efficiency of the space/ 
program.

1. Introduction
Project management can be defined as to achieve predefined objective or scope apply available resource, Skills, 
tools and knowledge effectively. Effective project management can be achieved by effectively implementing and 
integrating of resources. A project may be managed in three separate scenarios: as a stand-alone project (outside of 
portfolio or program), within program, or within a portfolio, subsidiary programs, and coordination of program 
operations to achieve benefits not possible through individual management. 
Program is defined as set of projects with some similar scope or type. Program management is defined as the use of 
different tools and techniques along with skills to achieve effectiveness and goals by smoothing the activities. 
Program management planning in IT industry is highly inclined towards the resource management, stakeholders’ 
management and frequent program or space activities. 
To achieve effectiveness and optimization of program, it is essential to get required data in right time with minimum 
errors. Many industries follow manual processes to run program management activities, and it leads to quality errors

The monthly saving of time is the difference between the product of number of weeks in a month and the time 
needed for the activity before applying excel macro and the number of weeks in a month and the time needed for the 
activity after applying excel macro.

 = (5 weeks× 120 minute)-(5 weeks× 10 minute) 
= 600 minutes – 50 minutes = 550 minutes 
550 minutes is equivalent to 9 hours which is associated with $50 per hour.  
 
From the above calculation, it is found that the time is reduced by 550 minutes after applying excel macro. If 550 
minutes is considered equivalent to 9 hours and the cost associated for one hour is $50, then the total saving of cost 
is determined to be $450 per month. 
 
7. Conclusion 
From the application of excel macro automation tool to optimize the process it is found that to sustain in growing 
space/ program it is essential for industry to move toward automation/ optimization of the processes. The most 
common objective of automation is to improve effectiveness of space resource/ staffing management, which can be 
achieved through many ways. Excel macro is most easily available, easy to use, cost effective and effective tool 
available in market.  
 
As per the application of macro in this research paper the process time/effort has been reduced drastically by 550 
minutes monthly which contributes to saving of money as well. It has subsequently improved quality of the staffing 
management process and thereby the saved effort in this process can be streamlined to increase the quality and 
effectiveness of parallel/concurrent activities in the space/ program.

optimize every area of their supply and logistics operations. The key to doing both is effective supply chain 
management. To overcome that competitive stress all the industries are trying to improve the production of their 
supply chain. Industry 4.0 technologies are emerged as a solution for them to resolve all their issues and get some 
competitive advantage. The terminology Industry 4.0 was devised to depict the fourth industrial revolution. The 
implementation of the Industry 4.0 techniques like Internet of Things, Big data etc., to every aspect of the end-to-
end supply chain is called as Supply Chain 4.0 (SC 4.0). It places actuators everywhere, create networks all over, 
automate all the things, and inspect everything to remarkably enhance performance and customer satisfaction. 
Hence, the purpose of this paper is identifying the key performance measures of the impact of industry 4.0 on SCM 
in IT industry through literature review. Later we are going to evaluate the performance measures of the SC 4.0 in 
IT industry by employing Fuzzy AHP technique and there finding the ranking of the performance measures 
according to their importance.

1. Introduction
Within last three decades, information technology (IT) services have grown rapidly, touching almost all aspects of 
daily life. The trend away from the internet toward the new gadgets that employ virtualized cloud resources is 
among the most substantial changes. During this great adventure of the Era Of the internet, which seems determined 
by incorporating machine automated and porTable computational capabilities, the Internet is indeed interfacing to 
wireless connections. Such latest innovations have widened practically infinite opportunities for merging individuals 
and computers in a cyber-physical environment setting employing information from multiple resources and also 
actual device interconnections. The installation of this network system within the construction and operation setting 
is referred to as Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 encompasses 3D printing, industrial automation, CPS and Robotic 
systems, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, human-machine interfaces, device communication, block chain 
technology, internet of things, cloud-stored data, digitalization, driver less cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, and more. 
By integration of industry 4.0 technology in Supply Chain the organizations gets lot of benefits such as improved 
performance, cost and time reductions, better efficiency, and so on. Industry 4.0 combines smart manufacturing, 
smart amenities, and the Internet connected objects, with the goal of providing real-time data on production, 
machinery, and component flow. Even by knowing all this, still most of the organizations still thinking to implement 
this technology in their supply chain because of the high investment and lack of guidance.

Next, we going to find out the geometric mean and ranking of the performance measures of OPL aspect, just we like 
we did on above for performance aspects. 
 
By applying the Fuzzy AHP method to OPL performance measures, we can conclude PQ is more important measure 
and had more effect when compared with other measures, next followed by CT, CSI and FOT has the least effect. 
 
5.1 Validation 
Finally, now for all the 18 performance measures we will be using Fuzzy AHP method for finding Global Criteria 
weights (Table 12):

By applying the Fuzzy AHP method to all the 18 performance measures, we can conclude that based on the above 
Table (12), ROA is more important measure and had more effect when compared with other measures, next 
followed by SDS, RG, RUR. so on and FBA has the least effect. We can observe that in all the performance 
measures, ROA is contributed with 28% which is the highest, followed by SDS which is 17% and so on, FBA is the 
least contributed performance measure which is almost negligible. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future scope 
Initially we understood the importance of digitized supply chain in this competitive world, but transforming the 
traditional supply chain into digitized supply chain is not a easy task. It takes lot of time and initial setup cost is also 
high. We must go through lot of challenges while implementing it. Although some risk is there but still it’s worthy 
to go with that. Our objective is Evaluation of the performance measures of the impact of industry 4.0 on supply 
chain management in IT industry by using the Fuzzy AHP methodology. Triangular fuzzy numbers were used with 
the conventional AHP in turn to improve the degree of decisions of decision makers. In this first we identified 18 
key performance measures by conducting literature review and then joined those 18 measures which having 
similarity and kept under 5 performance aspects. After that we conducted a survey on Fuzzy AHP criteria 
identification for the impact of Industry 4.0 on supply chain management in IT industry and collected the responses 
from the industrial experts and the students whoever in the relevant field. Based on that survey report we have 
calculated the weights of all performance aspects of SC 4.0 for the selection of performance measures. In that we 
found that economical performance aspect is the most important aspect, then followed by industry 4.0, 
sustainability, operational and delivery performance aspects.

After that we find out the weights of the performance measures in the individual performance aspects. Finally, we 
find out the global criteria weights of all the 18 performance measures which are responsible for the considerable 
performance measurement. Further the ranking order of all the performance measures is determined by using Fuzzy 
AHP approach. In that return on assets is found to be most important performance measure followed by security and 
data safety, revenue growth and so on and freight bill accuracy is considered to be the least. 
The results found in this provides direction to IT industries in determining and seeking the best guidance for 
transforming their supply chain by using industry 4.0 techniques. 
Further research is required to investigate on the potential challenges occurring while transforming the supply chain 
with industry 4.0 technologies. An expansion of the scope of the interviews with industrial experts might be more 
helpful to look more detailed in this. If those interviews from different types of industries as well as different 
geographical areas then it helps to create more generalizable findings. Next research should be undertaken to find 
the new methods, structures, processes, management flows in the SC4.0.

Abstract  
 
As global healthcare has faced tremendous focus on the drug development process during the pandemic. During the 
pandemic, efforts were made to develop drug in couple of months, but every drug development process is bounded by 
risks. The drug development process tends to be lengthy and exhaustive process. Viewpoint of project management 
can assist in making the process rational with key milestones. Project risk management is one of the key areas of 
project, which focuses on quality and risk of project or process. This paper focuses on identifying and mitigating the 
risks encountered in the drug development process using the quality risk management framework and House of Risk 
(HOR) Analysis/Method. The study investigates the mitigation of the risks using the appropriate mitigation strategy. 
The House of Risk (HOR) model involves risk identification and risk mitigation. It enables to identify the risk at each 
step and mitigate them. The house of risk method ranks the risks and sets the appropriate priority for each of the risks 
encountered in the drug development process. After identifying the risk, the second phase of the house of risk method 
is to find the alternatives which can assist in mitigating the risks and consequently ranking them priority-wise. The 
results show that mitigation strategies determined in the study will enhance the drug development process.

1. Introduction 
The drug development process is a complex process involving three key aspects – efficacy, quality and safety. The 
low success rate for clinical trials is due to any one of the key aspects or combination of them. Risks can arise at any 
stage of the drug development process and may become conducive environment for adverse risks to occur. The adverse 
risks may lead to discontinuation of drug development research program. The criticality involved in drug development 
process is high. Bacchieri A. et al. (2020) suggested from past research that, it is evident that the potential risks must 
be identified, and the corresponding mitigation plan should be established for the overall drug development process. 
From business standpoint, the cost involved is huge. The drug development process should justify the time and cost 
constraints to bring the drug to the market. The key principles of drug development process are optimizing trial cost, 
minimizing trial timeline and compliance with quality regulations. The drug development process tends to be lengthy 
and exhaustive process. Viewpoint of project management can assist in making the process rational with key 
milestones. Decision making plays a significant role in project management. Hallikasa. J et al. (2004) gave the idea 
that the forum of decision-makers are highly aware, by identifying the risks, about events that may bring uncertainties 
in the process.

The results show that applying the basic project management efficiencies can help improve the overall drug 
development process (Table 7). Owing to the complex nature of the drug development process, it is highly encouraged 
to apply strong project management strategies and techniques to maintain smooth flow of the project within given 
timelines and cost. In addition, time and cost are greatly involved in the drug development process and hence, it is 
necessary to optimize the resources and mitigate risks strategically. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The research work presented shows, quality risk management gives impetus on risk communication which helps in 
mitigating risks before it leads to catastrophic failure in the drug development process additionally, smooth 
communication is the thin line which helps in risk mitigation in the drug development process. Therefore, it is essential 
to keep risk communication plan in the project to work more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, maintaining a 
project risk plan helps to keep awareness about all the upcoming good and bad risks in the project. Managing the 
resources optimally is equally important for success of the project. Managing data is critical for smooth functioning 
for the overall drug development process. To conclude, implementing the basic project management activities of 
tracking the project plan, optimization of resources, maintaining project risk plan, managing data and keeping the 
significant stakeholders informed about the risks helps enhance the overall drug development process and ultimately 
adds more years to the lives of patients.

Abstract 
This study describes the dramatization of the COVID19 vaccination news broadcast on television in Indonesia. This 
research has a constructivist paradigm and an interpretive approach with a qualitative descriptive method. The 
research object is to broadcast the news about the COVID 19 vaccination on the Kompas Petang program on 
Kompas TV and Metro Hari Ini (MHI) on Metro TV from January - 28 to January 2021. Metro TV and Kompas TV 
were chosen as research objects because, as news TVs, they are ideologically different. Kompas TV is independent 
because it is not affiliated with a political party, while Metro TV is pro-government because its owner is the General 
Chair of the National Democratic Party (Nasdem), a government supporter. W. Lance Bennett's dramatized news 
theory and John Langer's concept of tabloid television was used to answer the research questions. The study found 
the following forms of dramatization of COVID-19 vaccination reporting: highlighting conflicts in the news of 
COVID-19 vaccination; displaying dramatic images to evoke the emotions of the audience; use of Natural Sound 
and back sound that are dramatic and suspenseful; news headlines that give the impression of frightening the 
audience; make artists and politicians as news and trivialization of COVID-19 vaccination news.

1. Introduction
This study aims to describe the forms of dramatization in television coverage of COVID-19 vaccination in 
Indonesia. As a form of mass media, television plays an essential role in conveying messages to the public, 
including information about the COVID-19 pandemic (McQuail and Deuze, 2020). This statement is in line with 
one of the functions of the mass media, namely conveying information (Ardianto et al. 2017). Therefore, the media 
must present accurate, comprehensive, and intelligent reporting about the COVID19 pandemic (Romli, 2018). 
Since the end of 2019, the theme of the COVID-19 pandemic has been making headlines in the media, including in 
Indonesia. This statement is in line with COVID 19, a global pandemic. In Indonesia, the first known COVID 19 
was on March 2, 2020, when two Depok, West Java residents were positively exposed to COVID 19 (Nuraini, 
1560","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Warangal, Telangana, India, August 16-18, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
while President Joko Widodo and the governors who are the source of news about vaccinations at MHI and Kompas 
Evening are included in the news value of The Power Elite. In addition to considering the value of news, the Editors 
of MHI and Kompas Petang in packaging the news of COVID 19 vaccination in personalized news because the 
focus is on actors or parties related to COVID 19 (Baran and Davis, 2015). 
5.8. Trivialization of Images and News Content 
Another form of dramatization of the COVID-19 vaccination news at MHI and Kompas Petang is the trivialization 
of news content. Trivialization in the news means reporting trivial things, things that are not important and not 
related to the public interest, but more for the sake of attracting the audience. In news trivialization, public 
information is then added to things that are not important, such as adding artists as news sources (Adiprasetio, 2019; 
Bubak and Jack, 2019; Muhammad et al., 2020). Forms of trivialization in the news of the COVID 19 vaccination 
conducted by MHI and Kompas Petang are featuring Raffi Ahmad and Ariel Noah, two famous artists in Indonesia 
who are receiving vaccinations, issues, and pictures related to vaccination that are viral on social media, hoax issues 
about the Sinovac vaccine and the arrest of the hoax spreader. In addition, another form of trivialization of COVID-
19 vaccination news is about the fear of citizens when they will be vaccinated, the crowds, and the queues of 
residents who will be vaccinated. 
6. Conclusion
This study concludes that there are eight forms of dramatization of the COVID-19 vaccination news carried out by 
Kompas Petang on Kompas TV and Metro Today on Metro TV. First, it highlights the conflict in the news of the 
COVID-19 vaccination. Second, using dramatic images and provoking the audience's emotions. Third, natural 
sound, back sound, or musical illustrations evoke emotions in the audience. Fourth, make news headlines that give 
the impression of frightening the audience. Fifth, use hyperbole in the news narrative. Sixth, close-up images and 
image transition editing techniques arouse the audience's emotions. Seventh, make artists and politicians a source of 
news: eighth, trivialization of images and news content.

Abstract 
Metal foams are cellular structures fabricated by gas filled pores in a metal matrix. Metal foams possess exceptional 
mechanical as well as physical properties. The low thermal conductivity property of metal foam makes them a great 
choice for flame arrestor materials and heat exchangers. High stiffness and impact absorbing capabilities of the 
metal foams are utilized in high-speed ballistic testing. Tensile strength and corrosion resistance properties of metal 
foams are exploited in orthopedic applications. Sound damping characteristics are used in automotive industry for 
sound damping applications. For stiffening of structures, metal foams are used because of their high stiffness. 
Aluminum metal foams find numerous applications in military, marine and automobile sector. Various processes for 
fabrication of Aluminum metal foam are discussed in this review. Metal foam manufacturing is problematic due to 
the existence of solid, liquid, and gaseous phases at various temperatures. Despite the different ways and procedures 
for producing foamed metals, the foamed metal nevertheless contains flaws and non-uniformities. To increase foam 
quality, researchers must investigate and comprehend the stability of foam in liquid metals, which will aid in the 
development of more dependable and repeatable foam metal manufacturing procedures. The best way for producing 
aluminum metal foam for mechanical applications is found in this review. 
Keywords 
Cellular structure of aluminum foam, production techniques, properties, analysis. 
1. Introduction
The present world engineers are driven towards the fabrication of lightweight materials/alloys possessing specific 
properties to meet the sustainable development goals (SDGs) drafted by United Nations (UN) Hashmi et al. (2022). 
One such material is metal foam which is light weight and possess high strength to weight ratios, high specific 
stiffness, and considerably enhanced energy and sound absorption qualities that are used in the automobile and 
aerospace sectors. Ashby et al. (2020), Peng et al. (2019) Aluminium metal foams (AMF) have been synthesized 
using a number of fabrication routes such as Powder metallurgy, Friction Stir processing (FSP), injection gas 
melting, casting etc. Sreenivasa et al. (2018) the input parameters greatly influence the structure of the metal foam 
produced; open cell structure or close cell structure. A number of publications suggest that researchers have made 
attempts to optimize the input parameters. Each of the fabrication technique has merits and demerits. In this paper an 
attempt has been made to identify the best processing technique. 
2. Literature Review
From the available literature various researchers have investigated the effect of different process parameters on the 
synthesis of metal foam. For instance, Paknezhada et al. (2017) studied the relationship between the temperature of 
the heated surface and the impact of the angle of inclination by employing the free convection heat transfer. The 
results showed the foamed plates have better heat transfer rate in comparison to without foamed plated. The 
maximum heat transfer was obtained when the foamed plated were kept in vertical direction. When the surfaces are 
vertical, the AFM acts as a heat sink thus lowering the surface temperature by up to sixteen degrees Celsius. 
Mirzaalia et al. (2016) fabricated two distinct types of aluminum foams having closed-cell structure by using the 
expansion of a blowing agent, one with an even dispersion of cells along its length and the other with a varying pore 
size along its length. According to his hypothesis, foam samples' having small structural radial asymmetry 
throughout their length improves their mechanical properties. In order to do this, he investigated the microscopic 
structural features of foam samples using micro-CT imaging, and then used monotonic compression tests to 
determine how these traits relate to the foam samples' macroscopic mechanical properties. In addition, he carried out 
numerical assessments for the elastic properties section and validated them using the results of the experiments. 
According to his research, the macroscopic mechanical properties of AMF having closed-cell structure were not 
significantly affected by porosity gradients. Further investigation into the mechanical properties of closed-cell

4. Identification of a research gap and the scope of the current investigation 
From the available literature, it is clear that various techniques have been used to develop metal foams. It has been 
found that the input parameters greatly influence the development of metal foam. Researchers have meticulously 
worked on these processes to find the optimum set of parameters that may be used to develop the metal foam as per 
the required applications.  
The available routes developed for the fabrication of metal foams have some serious drawbacks. For instance, the 
metallic powders used in the fabrication of foams is generally expensive and results in macro-segregation. Also, the 
use of high-pressurized gas puts the life of the operator at risk and are highly time consuming.   
Among the various fabrication routes developed, FSP offers a number of advantages over other manufacturing 
routes: First the process is quite simple and is not time consuming, secondly it eliminates the use of pressurized gas 
required in other fabrication techniques, thirdly the process is economical in nature. A lot of work has been done in 
this field. However, this field requires much more exploration in order to fully the optimize the synthesizing process. 
The intricacies involving heterogenous nature of the FSP forms non-uniform/distorted pores which may deteriorate 
the quality of the foam produced. These problems necessitated to look for strategies that will produce metal foams of 
excellent quality with improved pore formation uniformity.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper has thoroughly discussed the different fabrication routes. Powder metallurgy, investment casting, Friction 
stir processing, hot extrusion etc. can be used to fabricate the aluminium metal foams. The researchers are exploring 
each of these processes to find the optimal parameters.  
The FSP is considered a better choice for the fabrication of metal foams as this process offers a number of 
advantages over other fabrication routes. Upon reviewing the available literature FSP offers a no of advantages over 
the other processes. As it is a cost effective and innocuous process. Additionally, this process eliminates the 
requirement of use of expensive metallic powders. In place of metallic powders commercially available plates are 
used for development of metallic foam.

Abstract 
Industries are looking for advanced maintenance techniques to reduce the cost of maintenance and increase the 
productivity of plants. Fault diagnostics is the focus area to reduce the downtime of the machine and ensure its 
durability. Bearing condition monitoring is important because bearings are the key component of rotary machines. 
Bearing failure detection relies heavily on vibration signal analysis. A defect in a rolling element causes the bearing 
to generate an impulsively responsive signal. This work contributes to the development of the framework to generate 
and acquire bearing vibration data. The data is collected for healthy bearing, bearings with cage damage, and ball 
damage. It generates a unique pattern of vibration signals for each bearing defect at constant, increasing, increasing 
and decreasing, and decreasing and increasing speeds. The data is post-processed using deep learning techniques 
capable of diagnosing and categorizing the different failure conditions. The paper proposes feature extraction and deep 
learning algorithms for diagnosing bearing faults. Feature extraction of signals is the traditional method of fault 
diagnosis, which involves expert knowledge and time. The 1D and 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) 
algorithms give an accuracy of 99%, which is far better than the feature extraction and artificial neural network (ANN) 
techniques, with an accuracy of 55%. Such techniques will help in the adaption of smart manufacturing in India.

1. Introduction
In fourth industrial revolution, companies focusing on the adoption of technologies related to industry 4.0. The world 
has witnessed the rapid digital transformation during the last few months, and machine learning, preventive and 
predictive maintenance are the key focus areas to increase productivity. Machine maintenance is carried out fast when 
the fault diagnosis is done correctly, and localization of faults is also important to reduce downtime and increase 
Overall Line Efficiency (OLE). Unplanned production shutdowns caused by equipment failure are the most expensive 
hence, early condition monitoring and fault diagnosis (CMFD) is critical for ensuring production reliability. 
1.1 Objective 
Given the current need for the Indian manufacturing sector to adopt industry 4.0 techniques this work focuses on the 
maintenance and health condition monitoring of taper roller bearing using deep learning algorithms. The goal is to 
propose a method for acquiring vibration data from taper roller bearing and post-processing the data in order to develop 
a machine learning models. Different bearing fault conditions such as cage damage, ball damage, cage and ball

7. Conclusion 
a) According to feature extraction and data visualization studies, faulty bearings generate more vibrations, and the 
vibration spectrum differs significantly and uniquely between healthy and faulty conditions.  
b) The developed data acquisition unit is able to sense and capture the unique pattern in vibration signals.  
c) The new approach based on CNN is developed in this study for diagnosing faults in the time domain vibration 
signals of taper roller bearings by 2-D image generation from vibration signals and utilizing CNN effectively for 
classification of images. 
d) Comparative study of fault diagnosis using ANN, 1D CNN, and 2D CNN is done on the same bearing data set. 
This shows that ANN gives only 55% accuracy, whereas both CNN-based approaches, are able to do fault diagnosis 
with 99% accuracy.  
e) The robustness of the model is tested by carrying out the experiments at varying speeds of bearing and also with 
combined faults. Under such varying operating conditions the deviation in validation accuracy score is only 1%. Hence 
above methods proved to be automatic, fast, and reliable to implement in industries.

1. Introduction
In today's world of digitalization where the use of the internet has increased enormously, due to which lifestyle of the 
people has changed significantly. One of the major changes in people’s day-to-day life is the use of online shopping. 
Recently, because of the efficient delivery services and secure transaction methods are available, online shopping has 
become popular among consumers. As websites show the review and complete description of the product to the user, 
selecting and buying the products of one’s interest has become easier than visiting stores or malls and searching for 
goods and services, which again saves a lot of time. Also, websites can be used for shopping at any time and are 
accessible worldwide, which reduces the time and location constraints for the user. Due to such reasons, consumers 
are preferring E-shopping over traditional shopping. Hence developing an e-commerce D2C website for any brand 
has become an unavoidable need of the business. To scale the business, developing an interactive, high speed and 
well-designed website by considering marketing opportunities and competitors are the basic requirement of any 
ecommerce business model (S. Moertini et al. 2014). Due to such high demand for developing websites within a short 
time, there are many platforms that have developed and are available in the market with different features and services 
(Patel et al. 2011). These platforms provide an easy solution for small as well as established businesses to develop 
their own website without any programming knowledge. For building a website choosing the best platform can be 
hard for any project manager or website owner.

Abstract 
Since their inception, video games have greatly interested different types of users and organizations, and the academy 
is not an exception. The principal purpose of serious video games in the academy is to discover new ways to interact 
with students and strengthen learning and teaching. Video games in education are constantly used in a greater scope 
to improve the educational process. On the other hand, it is essential to consider the characteristics that must be 
considered in these types of tools so that they fulfil their purpose without neglecting the interest and motivation of the 
player. The objective of this work was to perform a systematic review of the topic “technological acceptance models 
(TAM) applied to serious video games”. The investigation was done by performing searches in 6 scientific libraries 
to obtain a corpus of papers published between 2015 and 2021. Consequently, a lexical analysis was performed, and 
4 clusters were identified about this topic: i) Emotions, social influence, and gratifications; ii) Structural equations; 
iii) Educational challenges with technology, and iv) The technology acceptance model.

Abstract 
The intercontinental universities have emanated as an eminent feature on the international higher education 
outlook. In Kerala, there’s a tremendous increase in the migration of Keralite students to overseas over the past 
years. In this paper, an attempt is made to understand the reason for the migration and PR (Permanent Residence) 
of Students in Kerala to Study Abroad. Results depicts that there are some push-pull factors which motivates 
them to pursue their higher education in overseas institutions. This article also explores the propensity of 
Keralites in seeking Permanent Residence (PR) abroad after higher studies. It suggests that Universities in India 
should frame a policy for students to do part time work permit along with studies. This research gives a key 
knowledge to the home country Government and their educational universities to consider the relevance or 
importance of push-pull factor which motivate the students to study abroad.

1. Introduction
In terms of international student migration, India is both a regional host country and a leading sender country. 
India has traditionally been a learning center. Universities such as Nalanda and Takshashila drew academics 
from all over the world in ancient times. When India became modernized, it had over 350 universities and 16,000 
colleges, including IIT, IIM, Indian Business School, and AIIMS. Many students from various nations attended 
these educational institutions to further their studies. However now, students in India are increasingly interested 
in migrating to abroad in pursuit of their tertiary-level learning. Over the past decennium, there is an increase in 
the growth rate of 22% in the movement of student to overseas. As the COVID 19 pandemic open out and social 
distancing occurred which creates a huge disruption in education sector worldwide, impacted on the student's 
dream to study abroad on hold. Despite this pandemic, around 91% students show an increasingly keen on 
chasing their studies abroad. According to MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) of 2020, the total Indian students 
studying abroad reached 261,406 alone. From many states in India, vast number of students were hovering to 
abroad for achieving their ambition to learn higher education.  
Kerala is renowned as one of India's most literate states, with a hardworking young. Twenty Kerala institutions 
are among the top 100 universities in India according to NIRF 2020. But students in Kerala have the desire to 
pursue higher education abroad. Student migration was an unfathomed aspects of global migration flows and 
trends in Kerala. However, in the last five years has been seen a fast peak in the swarm of Kerala students seeking 
higher education in various professions in foreign states, particularly in Canada, the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Australia, and China. The majority of students who choose to pursue higher education in another 
country with the aim of securing permanent residency. In this study, an attempt is made to elucidate the reason 
for the migration of students in Kerala and keen interest in obtaining permanent residence after graduation in 
abroad.

that, most of the respondents, that is 56% got the source of information from internet. 83% respondents of the sample 
are willing to stay or to get PR (Permanent Residence) in abroad after completing studies. Limited job opportunity in 
home country and quality of life in foreign country are the major reasons for most of the respondents willing to stay 
or get permanent residence (PR) in abroad.  
The Chi-Square test at 5% level of significance shows that:  
Age has a significant relationship with Factors motivating to stay or get Permanent Residence (PR) abroad. Age of 
the respondents has no significant impact on Intention to stay or get Permanent Residence (PR) abroad. 
From this study it is found out that there are several reasons for the migration of students in Kerala to study abroad. 
So, we would like to suggest that, Government should take initiatives to override current education system from 
outdated or irrelevant curriculum; and implement practical and research oriented educational policy. Also, 
Government must make way to collaborate local universities with foreign universities to offer joint programs, from 
bachelors to doctoral, in all disciplines. and, also develop a tie-in between National research laboratories and other 
research centers for high standard and a synergic research. 
7. Conclusion
Students in Kerala are becoming pickier and more meticulous while choosing their educational career. They want to 
imbibe a global perspective and practical knowledge-based education. This expounded study concludes by proving 
that limited seats in governmental institutions, exorbitant fees in non-governmental institutions in home-country and 
quality of education in foreign country were the major reasons which motivates the students in Kerala to pursue their 
higher education in abroad. Here in this outlook it points out the propensity of the students to stay or get permanent 
residence after education is influenced by limited job opportunity in Kerala and the quality of life they will get in 
foreign country. Looking at the number of Keralites flee to abroad for higher studies, Government should investigate 
the possibility to lessen the migration and solution to increase the returning of students.  
Governments must take initiatives to promote collaboration between higher education institution in Kerala and 
international universities. Indian universities should frame a policy for students to do part time work permit along with 
studies. It also suggests the home country Government and their educational universities to consider the relevance or 
importance of push-pull factor which motivate them to study abroad. Overall, this study depicts the better 
understanding of Keralites reason for pursuing higher education abroad.

Abstract 
Kalaburagi in North Karnataka is a cluster for pulse processing units locally called as ‘dal mills’. Most of the units 
are small scale employing about 20-30 workers and about 300 plus industries are located. Pulse processing is carried 
out by machines, but many of the activities like loading, unloading, material handling, drying in sun, filling the bags 
etc. is carried out manually. The study focuses on the awkward working postures of workers and design of hand 
tools for spreading, and filling the pulses. The tools presently used are studied and the compatibility with operators 
noted down. The tools used known as ‘rake’ and ‘rake hoe’, but locally called as ‘raghawal’, raghawal patti and 
chata are designed in CATIA considering the anthropometric measurements of the workers. A modification is done 
and the tools raghawal and raghwal patti are redesigned and combined, thus saving the costs. RULA and REBA 
analysis is done on selected postures which indicate high risks (about 48% and 53%) in most of the postures and 
need corrective action. Another improvement is shown at the mixing workstation, where the risk is high due to 
unnatural postures. The workstation is designed in CATIA showing improvements in working posture and reducing 
the risks of musculoskeletal disorders. The findings also revealed prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders, excessive 
noise, poor awareness and usage of personnel protection devices like masks, ear plug, shoes etc. Several suggestions 
and recommendations are made to improve the working conditions to reduce the risks of MSDs, better design of 
tools and encourage the use of PPEs in the dal mills.

Abstract 
With the raise of vehicle usage the technology development also grooming up by introduction and the usage of 
multiple sensors in ECU – Electronic control unit as the result of this the heating up problem existing so that the 
carbon di oxide emission is also getting increased. Another major problem which arises in the Automotive 
embedded system in the autonomous vehicle is the safety and security based system by priority based monitoring 
and controlling the temperature and the toxic gas emission to minimise the drastic cause like the death due to the 
emission of toxic gases like CO2 from temperature raise and Freon from the air conditioner in car. To make the 
drawbacks to bring out the betterment in the autonomous vehicle by using the Tinker cad simulation tools.

1. Introduction
Now a day, along with the growth of population the usage of the vehicle is also getting increased though fuel price is 
reaching the peak. There may lot of advancement available in the vehicles the number of accidental rate is not in 
decreasing rate it’s the bitter truth. Approximately 1.35million people die in road crashes each year worldwide. 20-
50 million suffer non –fatal injuries often resulting in long term disabilities. 2-8% is lost from a country’s GDP due 
to road crashes. Most of the accidents were caused by human errors.  
The most trending in the transportation is the autonomous vehicles. That is the most advanced autopilot mode of 
driving will be present along with the technological development in the automotive means. That is the most 
important three aspects such as sustainability, conformability and the safety means. The sustainability here figures 
out the emission of heat. Due to the expel of the heat the level of carbon di oxide level get increased due to 
temperature and the emission of the Freon gas from the car air conditioner so as to avoid these the term 
sustainability is incorporated, the second on is the conformability which talks about the comfort of the people 
present inside the vehicle, so according to the physical appearance of the members the persons can alter the seating 
arrangement and the third important aspect is the safety and security which is introduced for the caution driving for 
both the vehicle and the driver. This huge is achieved by the usage of multiple sensors. Tesla is the world number 
one position for the usage of the multiple tasks in it. Though multiple number of sensors are used there are three or 
four accidents occurred recently, with the low budget Waymo Company working under this autonomous as it tries to 
make a lead as like the best mileage provider for cars in the world 
1.1 Objectives 
By using the AutoSar standard in collaboration with the sensors and priority used in order to have a hassle free and 
safe journey with vehicles the task of increase of  toxic gas like Co2 and Freon gas detection by using the simple 
Arduino uno , sensors and buzzers in order to a) find the raise of the temperature prediction, b) the prediction of the 
toxic gas Freon inside the vehicle which expels out from the Air conditioner of the car and as a overview of safety 
driving of the autonomous vehicle is made in to concern to give the better results of safety driving eco friendly.

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The abrupt technical advancement in the means of self-driving, safety, comfort ability , design appearance, fuel 
consumption , power consumption , overheating , locking system, tracking system, finger print and facial 
recognizing etc., in the Autonomous vehicle definitely attracts every of us to float in the dream world no doubt in 
that. The person who drives the low advancement autonomous car must go through a ecofriendly journey apart from 
the probability of occurring of harm due to the gas and the temperature is made into notice for the improvement by 
the successful simulation using tinker cad.  
 
5.4 Validation  
The result is thus validated by simulating the monitoring and the detecting process by means of the tinker cad 
circuit. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Thus, this paper insists about the importance of the safety of the people who are travelling inside the autonomous car 
has to be taken this as the concern. As the accidents can happen because of these toxic gases which expels out and 
kill us without our knowledge. As a feature work this idea can be incorporated even to the basic cars with the air 
conditioner facility as it can be fixed with affordable cost. 
 
For minimizing the temperature raise of the car due to the long driving it mandatory to leave a break of minimum 10 
to 15 minutes in every 2hours of journey so as to avoid the temperature raise in the car bodies which may help to 
avoid or at-least the minimal usage of the AC in car decreasing the probability of the flow of the toxic gases which 
produces harm to both the human and environment to have a ecofriendly safety journey.

Abstract 
Three-point bending load, the flexural performance of Glass/Epoxy laminate specimens has been successfully 
measured often with artificial flaws of various geometric patterns and three separate sizes placed at different places. 
The present work is aims to determine the optimum ply angle and to study the behavior of composite material under 
various loading condition likely to be flexural performance both experimental and analytical using Ansys. Film 
defects were created on the laminated at obituary location. Laminates are prepared using GFRP material and three 
point bending test was performed to study the results.

1. Introduction
On the basis of recent investigations, an outline of composite materials is provided, together with information on 
their categorization, classification, and key advantages related to their mechanical and physical properties. The 
traditional methods of making composites and their applications were discussed there. The urgent necessity to 
develop new generations of composites that should include synthetic or natural materials by employing new 
effective manufacturing procedures was brought to light (Rajak, 2019). These orientations produce a number of 
more complex failure modes that are aimed at forming the GFRP composite laminate's most advantageous stacking 
sequence under axial loading conditions. In order to better understand and forecast the behavior of GFRP Composite 
laminates with varied unidirectional fiber orientations under plane stress circumstances, the investigations used 
MATLAB and simulation methods (ANSYS) to analyze stress, strain, and deformation values (Sadaq, 2022). 
Hybrid composite laminates damage behavior is investigation using flexural test. Specimens are created in the shape 
of a sandwich, with carbon/epoxy plies serving as the infill panels and aramid /epoxy layer acting as the core. The 
great energy absorption characteristics of aramid /epoxy composites are anticipated to be utilized by such a design. 
By applying low-velocity impact at various energies, we pre-damage homogeneous composites. The remaining 
flexural strength for the affected specimens is then assessed using three-point bending tests (Wagih, 2020). To 
assess their influence on the first critical buckling and re-buckling loads, researchers should look into the impact of 
multiple delaminations on the compressive, tensile, and flexural strength of E-glass/epoxy composites (Aslan , 
2016). The bioactivity of the fibrous materials that are readily available around the world, their classification 
systems, and the fabrication methods used to conjure up the composite materials ought to be explored in order to 
determine the optimized distinguishing feature of the content for the intended application. Effectiveness of 
composite materials is primarily dependent on their individual materials and production technologies. To identify 
the most effective soluble fiber composite material for practical uses, an overview of a wide range of fibers, their 
properties, functionality, classification, and different fiber composite manufacturing procedures is offered. Fibers 
composite materials are a viable alternative to single metals or alloys due to their remarkable performance in the 
many domains of application (Rajak D.K, 2019). Numerous studies have been done on how the stacking order and

4. Conclusions 
The following observations were reached after a thorough analysis of the flexural behavior under three-point 
bending for the Glass/Epoxy laminate samples with and without artificial defects of different geometric shapes 
(circle and square) and with three different sizes (6mm, 8mm, 10mm) placed at different locations: 
• 
For both the samples with and without defects, a linear behavior up to a peak was seen in the load 
deflection graph, followed by a nonlinear trend. 
• 
When compared to a no defects specimen, a specimen with a square defect of one side 10 mm at layer 5 or 
6 showed a maximum drop in flexural modulus of 42.5 percent. 
• 
When the flaw is moved from the layers 1-2 to the layers 5-6, a fall in modulus of 5-8 percent is seen. 
• 
When a member is subjected to flexural loading, the shape and location of delamination are crucial, and 
their existence should be taken into account at the design stage. 
• 
The average percentage variation between experimentation and numerical (Ansys) is found to be 5% in the 
conditions of defects arrangement over the laminate.

Abstract 
In today’s present scenario our manufacturing sectors across the globe are in a transition phase moving towards 
incorporating smartness or intelligence into the systems to meet their goals before their competitor reaches, in this 
phase, they are trying to incorporate some concepts like IIoT (Industrial Internet of things), M2M(Machine to 
Machine), IoE(Internet of Everything), CoT(Cloud of things) e.t.c. In this paper, we are going to discuss how some 
of these above-mentioned technologies can be added to our present manufacturing systems we would show end to 
end process of adopting these technologies and we would see a brief challenges we may have to face during this 
transition phase.

1. Introduction
As we can see from our daily lifestyle each day a new product gets launched into the market and at the same time a 
recently released product gets obsolete. If we notice one thing from this, there is a tremendous increase in the 
number of manufacturing products along with this the manufacturing sector also needs to catch the trend going on in 
the market. 
Here comes the scenario where most of the developed nations develop new concepts like Industry 4.0, Made in 
China, Japan 2025, etc. and most of the prominent multinationals come into the picture and started developing new 
technologies which would help them to reach the above goal. 
At the same time the literature on different technologies like “industrial internet of things”, “digital twin”, “CoT 
(Cloud of Things)”, “M2M (Machine to Machine)”, and “cyber-physical system for manufacturing”, etc. evoloved. 
We have compared the popularity score of different technologies in the manufacturing sector from 01-Jan-2015 to 
01-Jan-2022 with the help of Google trends, as indicated in Figure 1. we can see that there is remarkable trending
popularity for the industrial internet of things.

The key challenges arising during incorporating IIoT in a manufacturing firm are(Čolaković and Hadžialić 2018): 
I. 
Due to heterogeneous objects, it's becoming difficult for everyone to come on to one platform and most 
companies follow their architectures and methods of integrating layers and keeping their methods a 
trade secret leading to a huge variety of devices/objects. In one way it increases competition among 
them but in the other way, they are not following a fixed architecture by which a consumer is being 
forced to use it even if he is not desired. 
II. 
It's becoming very difficult to control the flow of traffic and researchers are trying to find the best traffic 
path. 
III. 
Sometimes difficulties are faced during the transmission due to network, bandwidth, etc. problems, and 
also sometimes there are loss of packets during transmitting data to the cloud and there is a loss of real-
time applications 
IV. 
Data storage, the type of data collected and managed is also becoming difficult, in these recent trends 
there are some applications developed to overcome this problem. 
V. 
For one to choose a correct IoT model there is no metric (like power consumption, network latency, 
RAM required, CPU computation capability )and there is no literature available so the challenge comes 
here of developing a mathematical model with a simulation that would help one to get the perfect fit to 
the system. 
VI. 
Algorithms are yet to be developed which would optimize the load distribution between the sub-
components. 
VII. 
Developing a secure and well-established smooth flow of private networks is also becoming a challenge 
in this current scenario. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Many such protocols have been developed by ITU, IETF, IEEE and other organizations and many more are in 
development. Due to their large number, there consisted a dilemma in choosing, so we have tried to relate it with 
the industries. This paper aims to give an insight to developers to develop an end-to-end (From the beginning of 
the sensor transmitting data to the end of the user interface) approach for manufacturing. At last, we have briefly 
discussed some trending challenges that researchers are trying to solve.

Abstract 
Background: The chemistry of paints has changed over time and this led to potential health hazards for house 
painters. Survey and interviews scheduled on work profiles determined the exposure to solvents in commercial 
painting. Painting work was observed in many work situations at different sites. Aim: This research paper aims to 
explore the worker’s experiences with solvent-based and water-based paints regarding health implications. Methods: 
The current study is related to research on paint workers' health issues. Subjects for the study were chosen randomly 
from several places around Uttar Pradesh, India. An interview schedule was developed to collect relevant and 
maximum information. The study used a sample size of 150 that were not pre-determined. All the responders were 
from the labour class and worked with paints. A schedule of interviews was developed to gather information about 
the painters' demographic profile and current health status. The statistical approaches such as Standard Deviation 
and ANOVA were used for analysis. Results: The study reveals that painters are exposed to paints, so they have to 
face various health issues. Painters were at high risk and significantly associated with health problems and 
respiratory issues compared to the average population. Conclusion: Our study highlighted the risk and problems 
among painters due to paints, including breathing problems, prolonged cough, chest discomfort and almost all lung 
problems.

1. Introduction
Painting in the commercial sector involves working with coating materials either by a brush or manually. Painters 
are exposed to various chemicals throughout their work, including pigments, solvents, fillers, binders, and other 
additives, which they may inhale (Kim et al., 2013). 
Previously, these chemical exposures were expected to have no serious consequences. Recent statistical analyses 
have revealed that occupational exposure to organic solvents is potentially associated with chronic nerve damage 
(Gerhardsson et al., 2021). As a result, the paint industry began to produce new paints that included considerably 
lesser chemical solvents. These new ""water-based"" paints are emulsified pigments and polymers suspended in water 
with trace amounts of ingredients such as volatile organic compounds (Amo et al., 2002).  
Painters may face increased health risks as a result of this chemical complexity. When using water-based paints, 
painters have complained of skin sensitivity, excessive urination, and gastrointestinal issues (Wieslander et al., 
1994).  There seems to be a temporary increase in urine excretion and a decreased urine concentration, a slight 
increase in average red cell volume, and a reduction in pulmonary function (Wieslander et al., 1994). Another study 
on painters who used water-based paints reported a possible effect on the kidneys, as measured by increased

The research revealed various information about painters' general and occupational health. Demographic data and 
general information about painters were included in Table 1. The age of the respondents is a significant independent 
variable in determining the severity of the health problems. It might have a significant impact on painters' health. 
Education is another essential aspect for determining the level of work in the same occupation; it may affect 
painters' creativity and income.  
The survey also found that the socio-economic conditions of painters were poor. The majority of the respondents 
were from a lower socio-economic category (Table no. 2). The poor socio-economic situation is caused by illiteracy, 
a lack of skill development, or they all were unaware of government programs for the labor class.  
The occupational profiles of the respondents reveal information such as years of experience, working days, and 
working duration that has a considerable impact on painters' health. In a similar study, workers exposed to silica dust 
and spray painting had an increased risk of lung cancer as their work experience year increased (Tse et al., 2011). In 
Table 4, Lung difficulties were associated with age. Different types of lung and respiratory difficulties become more 
prevalent as respondents age, which was determined to be statistically significant (p=0.000). A comparable analysis 
revealed that construction painters with respiratory symptoms and disorders had a similar outcome (Park et al., 
2016). Another study on paint exposure and painters' health showed that all the patients suffered slight airway injury 
and restrictive ventilation dysfunction. Three out of seven patients had severe lung damage (Song et al., 2009) 
(Ramanakumar et al., 2011). 
This study also found that painters are more involved in their work and have more respiratory problems (Figure 1). 
Lung problems, heart problems, and asthma were the most commonly mentioned health issues. According to a 
study, spray painting has been associated with respiratory symptoms and lung function (Hammond et al., 2005). 
This study reported all respiratory symptoms like allergy, asthma, and cough (Hammond et al., 2005). A similar 
study identiﬁed samples at high risk associated with construction jobs recognized to be more at threat, such as 
painters, for getting lung cancer (Mattei et al., 2016). According to the data, COPD was not much prevalent problem 
among painters, but about 10.70% of the respondents suffered from this disease (Fig. 1). In a similar study, painters 
significantly had more COPD than other groups (Hammond et al., 2005).  
Results demonstrate that respondents who have worked for more years, days, and longer durations had more 
breathlessness, cough, tightness in the chest, irritation with paints, and trouble with smelling odors (Table 5) (Tse et 
al., 2011). We can find the result from the data (Table 5) that wearing the mask was significantly associated with 
respiratory problems like cough (p= .004), chest tightness (p= .009), and whistling sounds from the chest (p= .000).  
So as per result, we can conclude that wearing a mask is significantly associated with health problems, which may 
be due to the direct contact with paint fumes, dust, and other hazards while painting. A study reported that the 
respondents did not use the protective equipment, and most of them reported hazard-related symptoms (Awodele et 
al., 2014). 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper highlighted the risks and problems of paints among painters, including breathing problems, prolonged 
cough, chest discomfort, or almost all lung problems. Painting workers are supposed to get exposed to various 
physical, chemical, and biological carcinogens responsible for health problems. Respiratory and other health risk is 
often associated with dust and smoke, chemical pollutants, solvents, etc. As reported in the observations and studies, 
most of these toxic smokes, gases, residue, and other toxic particles can penetrate masks and other safety equipment, 
endangering painters even though precautionary measures are taken. The study came up with conclusions based on 
the research objectives in the study area. They were as follows: (a) The population at risk of ill health effects of 
paint exposure was significantly associated with age. (b) The study confirmed the presence and association between 
painting and asthmatic symptoms, bronchitis symptoms, lungs issue, heart issues, and other health problems. 
Therefore, it was concluded that the high proportion of painters suffering from various disease symptoms associated 
with painting was due to the presence of health hazards associated with the painting occupation. (c) It was observed 
that painters in the study were less using a mask during work and concluded that this lack of protection increased 
exposure time, increasing the likelihood of contracting disease symptoms associated with painting.

Abstract 
This study examines the effect of Social Responsibility Disclosure as measured by ISO 26000 indicator, Carbon 
Emission Disclosure as measured by the index developed by Choi, Lee, and Psaros (2013), Green Investment as 
measured by the PROPER award achieved by companies, and Financial Performance as measured by the ratio of 
Debt to Equity (DER) to Company Value as measured by the ratio of Tobin's Q on the KOMPAS100 index 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016 – 2020. The data for this study were obtained through 
quantitative research. The data involved a sample (n=45) of nine companies for 5 years. The data from this study 
including panel data and data processing techniques used are in the form of Least Square Analysis (OLS) using 
SPSS version 26. The results show that Social Responsibility Disclosure has no significant effect, Carbon Emission 
Disclosure has a significant positive effect, Green Investment does not have a significant effect and Financial 
Performance (DER) has a significant negative effect on firm value in the company. 
Keywords 
Social Responsibility Disclosure, Carbon Emission Disclosure, Green Investment, Financial Performance and Firm. 
1. Introduction
Based on data from the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), several companies conduct Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) 
every year. In 2016 there were 16 companies; in 2017, there were 37 companies; in 2018, there were 55 companies; 
in 2019, there were 51 companies; and in 2020, 54 companies were conducting Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). This 
indicates that economic conditions tend to be positive and growing. This economic development will lead to intense 
competition between companies to improve performance and value to achieve company goals (Wiagustini, 2014). 
Firm value is an economic concept that describes the value of a company, or the value paid to take over a company. 
The company's value needs to be considered by the company, as the value can influence investors' views on how 
management runs the company. Some factors can affect the value of a company, namely internal factors and 
external factors. Internal factors can be controlled by the company, while external factors come from outside the 
company and cannot be controlled by the company (Santika and Ratnawati, 2002). 
To determine whether its financial performance is good or bad, the company has financial analysis tools describing 
its financial condition. One of the company's strategies to achieve its goals is to maintain its financial performance 
as well as possible. Maintaining the company's financial performance is essential for companies to attract investors. 
Investors often review the company's condition through financial ratios as an investment evaluation tool. Financial 
performance describes the company's ability to generate profits by utilizing its capital as effectively as possible. 
With sound financial performance, the company will find it easier to attract investors to invest in the company. 
Previously, Social Responsibility was only carried out by companies by ensuring welfare and maximizing 
shareholder profits (Friedman, 1970). Along with the changing conditions and values of society at this time, 
companies that previously only applied the single bottom line principle where the company only paid attention to 
profit have developed and followed the application of the triple bottom line or 3P (profit, people, and planet) which

(Tobin's Q) by 0.130. The Financial Performance (DER) variable has a T-value of -3.426 and a p-value of 0.001. 
From these results obtained Tcount (-3.426) < T Table (2.021) and p-value (0.001) < 0.05, so H4 can be declared 
accepted. This shows that the Financial Performance (DER) variable individually has a significant negative 
effect on Firm Value (Tobin's Q). Financial Performance (DER) has a significant negative effect, meaning that 
every time there is a decrease in the value of DER, there will be an increase in firm value. This illustrates that a 
company with a high DER value will be considered unhealthy because it illustrates that the company has a high 
level of debt and does much financing using debt compared to its capital. Companies that look unhealthy will 
describe poor financial performance, resulting in a lack of investor interest in the company's shares. High debt 
levels can also be seen as a threat or a negative signal for investors, indicating the company's obligation to pay 
principal and interest on the debt. 
 
6. Conclusions  
This study was conducted to analyze the effect of Social Responsibility Disclosure, Carbon Emission Disclosure, 
Green Investment, and Financial Performance on the Firm Value of the KOMPAS 100 index companies listed on 
the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2016 – 2020. In this study, the independent variable Social Responsibility 
Disclosure is measured by the disclosure of corporate social responsibility based on ISO 26000 indicators, Carbon 
Emission Disclosure is measured by the index developed by Choi, Lee, and Psaros (2013), Green Investment is 
measured by the PROPER award achieved by the company, Financial Performance is measured by the ratio of Debt 
to Equity (DER), and the Tobin's Q ratio measures the dependent variable Firm Value.  
 
This study uses a quantitative approach with the object of the KOMPAS100 index company listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange from 2016 - 2020. The type of data used in this study is secondary data in the form of audited 
financial statements and annual reports or sustainability reports which data source is obtained from the official 
website of the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and the company's official website, the report on the results of the 
assessment of the company's performance rating in environmental management (PROPER) which data source is 
obtained from the website of the Ministry of Environment (www.menlh.go.id), as well as books, journals, or 
scientific articles relevant to this research topic. The sampling method used in this study was purposive sampling, 
and the final total sample used was 45 data. Hypothesis testing was carried out with the help of IBM SPSS version 
26 software. The following are the conclusions of the results of hypothesis testing that have been carried out in this 
study. 
1. Social Responsibility Disclosure has no significant effect on the company's value on the KOMPAS100 index 
listed on the IDX for the period 2016 – 2020. 
2. Carbon Emission Disclosure has a significant positive effect on company value in the KOMPAS100 index listed 
on the IDX for 2016 – 2020. Carbon Emission Disclosure has a significant positive effect, meaning that for every 
increase in Carbon Emission Disclosure, there will also be an increase in company value. 
3. Green Investment has no significant effect on the company's value on the KOMPAS100 index listed on the IDX 
for the 2016 – 2020 period. 
4. Financial Performance (DER) has a significant negative effect on company value on the KOMPAS100 index 
listed on the IDX for 2016 - 2020. Financial Performance (DER) has a significant negative effect, meaning that 
every time there is a decrease in the value of DER, there will be an increase in the company's value.

Abstract 
Design thinking is a human-centric approach that can be applied to Product Design, Processes, and Service Delivery. 
In recent times design thinking has gained importance for Strategy formulation and innovation in business. Many 
larger organizations like Apple, Nike, IBM, and UBER have already adopted this approach for their business 
transformation and strategy implementation. Micro, Small and Medium enterprises are lagging behind the best 
practices of Strategy in Procurement. Many Organizations procure items on an ad hoc basis which will increase the 
cost of manufacturing. Due to Covid-19, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine supply chain disruption is taking 
place across the globe. Inflation, pollical uncertainty, commodity price rise, and oil price hikes impact the profitability 
of Medium, Small, and Microenterprises. Micro Medium and Small enterprises can be gained by adopting the design 
thinking philosophy in their business to transform into the next level in Procurement Strategy and leverage 
competitiveness. Empathy Study is the starting point to understanding customer experiences. An attempt is made to 
understand the pain points and gain points by using a Business Canvas Model to interview the 10 organizations as a 
pilot study.  A field study was conducted on Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises in India between February 2022 
to April 2022. From this field study, insight into the procurement process of Micro Small, and medium enterprises has 
arrived. This study can be further enhanced for a larger population to get insights into Procurement Strategy in Micro, 
Small, and Medium Enterprises in India and find out the research findings.

1. Introduction
Business is not as usual as we think in the past. Lots of uncertainty, risk, and disruption in supply chain management 
hampers the progress of Organizations. Many Strategies are adopted based on the historical data and predict the future, 
which is no longer valid. There is an interrelation between people’s emotions, processes, events, and ideas.  In his 
book The Science of the Artificial (1969), Professor from Carnegie Mellon University, USA, Herbert Simon described 
the idea of design as a way of thinking. He distinguished between critical thinking as an analytical approach for 
breaking down the process and the design-centric mode of thinking as a process of building up ideas. The design 
thinking approach made attention from all World for business transformation. Design thinking is a problem-solving 
technique to balance needs and feasibility. The design thinking approach is not only limited to designers and can be 
applied to people’s information behavior, helps in finding out the critical gaps, and identifies the risk. Table 1. Shows 
the paradigm shift in the way of thinking from a management perspective

1. Many MSME industries in India are lagging behind the best practice of the Procurement Process 
2. Through Procurement Strategy MSME can be better positioned 
3. 60 to 70% of the costs are involved in materials costs. By optimizing the cost of the procurement of the 
materials MSME sector can be saved on the overall manufacturing cost. 
4. Reduction of the cost is possible through better Vendor Management 
5. Value Proposition can be achieved through better procurement Strategy 
6. Conclusion  
Design thinking is a human-centric approach. This approach has been adopted in many businesses application to solve 
their business problems. The business canvas model is a widely accepted tool to understand user experiences and 
empathy study.  In this study, we are adopting a design thinking approach for Procurement strategy in Micro, Medium, 
and Small Enterprises. We have conducted interviews for 10 Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises as a pilot study. 
From this field study, we conclude that Many MSME sector in India is lagging behind the best practice of the 
procurement process. 60 to 70% of the costs are involved in materials costs, by using a better procurement strategy 
MSME can reduce the cost of materials, and with better vendor management and procurement strategy value 
proposition can be achieved. We arrive at how the procurement strategy is important for the creation of a value 
proposition. A more detailed quantitative analysis will be conducted on more sample data to get insights into the 
relationship between procurement strategy and competitiveness of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises and the 
overall performance of the MSME sector.

Abstract 
Human resource development has been an interesting topic to be discussed since it strategically improves the overall 
organizational performance. Moreover, the industrial era 4.0 which has been growing rapidly also demands the need 
for agile human resources. Universities as educational institution have a vital role to contribute to this development. 
A good academic staff development practice will bring positive impact to the quality of students so that it is strongly 
required to build a better capacity building system for younger generation. On the other hand, human resource 
development is a domain which can be solved using the MCDM approach as it involves multiple factors as well as 
decision-makers (DMs) to make an effective strategic decision. Accordingly, this study aims to develop an evaluation 
model for human resource development strategies in the education sector. Specifically, an academic staff development 
case in terms of research policy is selected and then the model is tested at a private university in Indonesia. In this 
study, the integration of three methods – SWOT matrix, interpretative structural modeling (ISM), and analytic network 
process (ANP) – is applied where a SWOT matrix focuses on identifying the relevant strategies, the ISM method is 
to model causal relationships among the strategies, and the ANP method is to prioritize the strategies using the 
importance weights obtained based on the ISM structure. Finally, this study has identified the 18 academic staff 
development strategies and presented a fundamental and a target strategy that can be recommended to the DMs.

1. Introduction
In today’s industrial revolution 4.0, a higher education institution has a vital role in preparing skilled and agile future 
generations. Further, an integrated research and education activities possessed by universities provides more benefits 
to enhance student capacity with the required competencies (Maaded and Ponnamma 2020). The relevant industrial 
4.0 competence can also be achieved with new teaching and learning practices known as the concept of Education 4.0 
(Neaga 2019). The concept digitized the education practices in higher education institutions in order to response the 
human resource needs in today’s digital era. Another approach can also be reached by redesigning multi-disciplinary 
nature-based curriculum as proposed by Mokhtar and Noordin (2019) highlighting Malaysian National Policy on 
Industry 4.0. Although it has been critical issues in most parts of the world, the future supply of human resources can 
significantly be addressed through the role of education.  
At universities, building qualified and competent academics have become a key decision to express the contribution 
in teaching and learning activities, research, and community service (Nguyen 2016, Salesho and Naile 2014,

Secondly, the DMs are invited to develop pairwise comparison matrices based on hierarchical interactions using the 
Saaty’s scale. The weights calculated using geometric mean computation and the ISM structure are then used as input 
to construct the unweighted supermatrix as shown in Table 4. Lastly, the unweighted supermatrix is normalized to 
obtain a weighted supermatrix so that the importance weights for all strategies can be determined. Table 5 presents 
the final weights and the rank of the 18 strategies (Table 5).

Overall, based on the weights of strategy obtained, the development strategy order is WT>WO>ST>SO. Although the 
WT strategy has the greatest weight of 0.468, the sub-strategy’s priority is WO4 where in the ISM model is plotted to 
be the fundamental strategy. In particular to the WO strategy, the DMs should pay more attention to WO4, WO1, and 
WO2 which are in the top important strategies representing the first rank, the third rank, and the fifth rank, respectively. 
Although there are some different results between ISM model and ANP rank, the importance weight obtained by using 
the ANP method describes more relevant situation as the weights are calculated based on the ISM structure, while the 
ISM method can merely visualize the leveling model. This result may ease the DMs to consider the best development 
strategy over the others thoroughly taking into limited resources when executing several development programs 
simultaneously. In this case, the integrated ISM-ANP method emphasizes the importance of WO4 strategy to become 
fundamental strategy, and thus the strategy should be prioritized by the DMs at the university. As indicated in the ISM 
model that the rewarding system can be set as a final or goal strategy after the others are accomplished.      
 
5. Conclusion 
This study integrates three methods, namely SWOT analysis, ISM, and ANP for academic staff development strategies 
applied in a private university in Indonesia. A SWOT analysis is selected to identify the strategies taking into account 
both internal and external factors. Then, the integration between ISM and ANP is proposed to evaluate a more effective 
and thorough academic staff development policy since it may not only model the causal relations, but also finding a 
key strategy by taking into account the importance weight based on the strategies’ relationship. In this study, it is 
considered that the WO4 strategy – increased research outputs – has become a fundamental strategy for the others. 
Although this paper has developed a new evaluation model for human resource development strategies demonstrated 
by selecting academic staff, it is encouraged to investigate another subject such as student development since these 
two entities are main asset for the educational institution. Furthermore, the interaction between academic staff 
development strategies and student development strategies can be elaborated in follow-up studies.

Abstract 
This study aimed to determine the factors that influence the acceptance of external auditors in adopting artificial 
intelligence as whistleblowing practice with the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) 
approach. This study uses a data collection method as a survey by distributing questionnaires. The data processing 
in this study used smartPLS 3.3.9. The population of this study was external auditors who worked in Public 
Accounting Firms in DKI Jakarta, and a sample of 126 respondents was obtained by purposive sampling. The 
results show that Performance Expectancy has a significant effect on the Behavioral Intention of external auditors 
in adopting Artificial Intelligence as a whistleblowing practice, while Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and 
Facilitating Conditions have no significant effect on the Behavioral Intention of external auditors in adopting 
Artificial Intelligence as a whistleblowing practice.

1. Introduction
Industrial revolution 4.0 opens up vast opportunities and challenges for anyone to advance. This is related to the 
Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, robots, and so on. 
News technology that is increasingly easily accessible to all corners of the world makes all humans able to connect 
and use news. Abundant and complex information as empirical found in the current industrial revolution era 
(Novak, 2013). 
Financial statements are also a measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of the company's performance, which 
is helpful for most report users in making economic decisions. Along with the company's efforts to face industry 
4.0, problems in the company can occur. These issues include occupational fraud such as misappropriation of 
assets, corruption and fraudulent financial statements perpetrated by management companies and others for 
personal gain (Handoko & Liusman, 2021). 
Fraud cases are also still a significant problem in Indonesia. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (2017) 
states that fraud is a latent danger that threatens world economic growth. Corruption cases cause the most 
fraudulent losses in Indonesia, an average of 100 to 500 million per case (Pramudyastuti et al., 2021). 
With the increasing number of fraudulent actions, it becomes a challenge for the role of auditors in managing 
change in the era of the industrial revolution 4.0. The external auditor's role is essential in detecting fraud in the 
company's financial statements so that the auditor can provide an audit opinion on whether the report has been 
presented relatively by applicable accounting principles. But in reality, there are still frauds that are not detected 
by the auditor, or even an auditor can commit human errors or fraud (Handoko & Liusman, 2021). 
Whistleblowing practices are also considered as governance that can mitigate corporate fraud (Rachagan & 
Kuppusamy, 2013). The PWC report claims that the implementation of whistleblowing is still not widely 
implemented even though every organization has an effective whistleblowing policy (PWC, 2014). However, 
there are different opinions about whistle-blowers. Some consider the whistle-blower as a noble figure because 
he sacrifices the professional and personal aspects to reveal ethical irregularities in the company. However, some

6. Conclusion 
Based on the study results, it can be concluded that Performance Expectancy has a significant positive effect on 
the Behavioral Intention of external auditors in adopting Artificial Intelligence as a whistleblowing practice. Effort 
Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions have a positive but not significant effect on the 
Behavioral Intention of external auditors in adopting Artificial Intelligence whistleblowing practices. The 
conclusion of the Performance Expectancy variable on Behavioral Intention is that perceived benefits, relative 
advantages and expectations of the results of using technology affect the intention or intention of external auditors 
in using Artificial Intelligence as a whistleblowing practice.

Abstract 
In Indonesia, bank sustainability received special attention after the issuance of the Sustainable Finance Roadmap 
Phase 1 in 2014 by the Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan). This roadmap is based on the criticism 
of development which solely targets economic growth but is not followed by attention to the issue of environmental 
degradation and social inequality. The negative impact of unsustainable economic development has prompted the 
initiation of sustainable development that prioritizes the harmony of economic, environmental, and social aspects, or 
in other words the triple bottom line. This study aims to examine and analyze the effect of sustainability management 
practices, green intellectual capital, and enterprise risk management toward Indonesian banking sustainable growth. 
Multiple regression analysis with panel data was used for hypothesis testing in this study. The sample in this study 
consists of 50 observations from 10 banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange between 2016 and 2020. The results 
showed that sustainability management practices have a negative effect on Indonesian banking sustainable growth 
whereas green intellectual capital and enterprise risk management positively affected the sustainable growth of 
Indonesian banking.

1. Introduction
Recently, many companies have implemented sustainable business practices to fulfill stakeholders demands and 
expectations (Handajani et al. 2021). The same expectations are also found in the banking industry. The banking 
industry is one of the industries that plays an important role in supporting sustainable development practices, one of 
which is as a driver of inclusive economic growth and development in a country (UNEP FI, 2016). Alinska et al. 
(2018) argue that active participation from banking sector is also needed in the sustainable development process which 
is the responsibility of the government. The existence of social issues that are inseparable from environmental issues 
also has a significant impact on the financial performance of banks (Ward and Naude, 2018). This has become one of 
the triggering factors for the emergence of issues regarding sustainable banking. In addition, the statement from Ward 
and Naude (2018) also implies that sustainable banking will have good financial performance. The existence of good 
financial performance will surely be followed by sustainable business growth as well. Therefore, banks need to 
implement and pay attention to sustainable practices by integrating environmental, social, and governance aspects as 
part of their business strategy. In Indonesia, the regulation regarding sustainable finance has been issued by the 
regulator through the Financial Services Authority Regulation Number 51/POJK.03/2017 concerning the 
Implementation of Sustainable Finance for Financial Services Institutions, Issuers, and Public Companies. However, 
currently there are only 8 public banks in Indonesia that have committed to implementing sustainable banking 
practices (WWF, 2020).

observations on banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange during the 2016-2020 period in a row. Sample selection 
was done using purposive sampling technique. 
 
The results of this study indicate that SMP negatively affected Indonesian banking sustainable growth, meanwhile, 
GIC and ERM positively affected Indonesian banking sustainable growth. The limitation of the study lies in the ability 
of the independent variable to explain the variation of the bank's sustainable growth of 44.52%. In other words, the 
remaining 55.48% is still explained by other independent variables that are not used in this study. The second 
limitation is that the study only covers companies from the banking industry sector listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange and the period used in this study only covers 5 years from 2016 to 2020. 
 
Based on the conclusions and limitations of the research that has been submitted, the researchers can provide the 
following suggestions. For bank management, it is hoped that the results of this research can serve as a reference and 
motivation to consider internalizing aspects of sustainability and risk management in banking strategies and activities. 
For the Indonesian government, the results of this research are expected to be input to intensify socialization for banks 
in Indonesia, so that they pay more attention to risk management and sustainability aspects (profit, people, planet) in 
the strategies and business decisions taken. For further researchers, the results of this study can be used as a reference 
in future research. For further research, it is expected to increase the research period and other variables that are 
thought to affect the bank's sustainable growth, as well as expand the scope of the research industry.

Abstract 
Entrepreneurship is essential to Indonesia's economic development. It is evidenced by 99.9 percent of all Indonesian 
firms are micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Entrepreneurship is regarded as a phenomenon that 
has received the greatest attention in recent years. Among scholars, there is a strong desire to investigate the 
entrepreneurial phenomena not only because of its unavoidable importance in boosting the economy and creating job 
possibilities. Young generations play an essential part in entrepreneurial ventures since they are more likely to start a 
new business than older generations. However, research studies found Gen Y and Gen Z have different characteristics, 
which leads to differences in entrepreneurial orientation. The study successfully collected the primary data from 389 
newbie entrepreneurs who distributed closed-ended questionnaires using a 5-point Likert scale. This study adds 
significantly to the existing entrepreneurial literature by examining entrepreneurial orientation between these two 
generations based on three dimensions: innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking. In addition, the Rasch model 
was used in this study. The study's outcomes demonstrate a significant difference in risk taking dimension between 
gen Y and gen Z. Practical implications based on this research of entrepreneurial orientation among the two 
generations can be empowered through entrepreneurial education programs.  The study provides the recommended 
methods to develop each gen Y and gen Z entrepreneurs.

1. Introduction
Entrepreneurs is seen as an individual with distinct personality qualities, despite the fact that there are many different 
viewpoints on the subject. As far as character traits go: ""(1) cooperativeness and a strong team player, (2) strong desire 
to work hard and learn new things, (3) ability to listen to others and build networks, (5) not competitive but visionary 
and goal setting, (6) strong self efficacy, (7) coach or trainer and (8) not more risk-prone than other professionals"". 
Entrepreneurs must be self-starters with a can-do mentality, a thirst for knowledge, excellent interpersonal skills, and 
a drive for success. The characteristics of successful entrepreneurs as ""success and accomplishment, risk carrier, 
opportunity explorer, persistence, confronting uncertainty, feedback, independence, adaptability, planner, self 
confidence, motivator, and stress taker"". Accordingly, it may be concluded that entrepreneurs are born with strong 
motives and a strong sense of business that can be found in human nature and in specific personality types (Mihalcea 
et al., 2012).

5.3 Discussion 
The study concluded that there are no significant differences in innovativeness between entrepreneurs from 
generations Y and Z. This may be due to the fact that both generations have characteristics that align well with the 
innovativeness attributes that emphasize taking action without waiting for others. Specifically, these two generations 
are technologically sophisticated, which increases the capacity for innovation in the current digital era. In addition, 
the study revealed that both generations typically seek out more productive new methods. It means that entrepreneurs 
of generations Y and Z are capable of creating creative products. 
Another notable discovery was that entrepreneurs of generations Y and Z take risks in significantly different ways. 
Gen Z was discovered to be more daring than gen Y. The outcome is consistent with the cited literature. Generation 
Z likes actual learning or doing before asking/thinking. They are not hesitant to test new company strategies. In 
addition, the investigation revealed that gen Z and gen Y have distinct properties. Gen Z typically takes action to 
achieve goals, whereas Gen Y frequently utilizes a variety of tools for growth. It means that entrepreneurs of 
Generation Z are quicker to launch new businesses. 
This study did not find significant differences between gen Y and gen Z entrepreneurs in proactiveness. This outcome 
may be explained by the fact that both generations are fearless in the face of uncertainty and prepared to share their 
expertise. In addition, they are noted for their independence, creativity, respect for diversity, adaptability, and 
preference for flat, interactive, and community-oriented structures or collaborative networks, all of which enhance 
their proactivity. In addition, the study revealed that both generations are constantly on the lookout for fresh chances. 
It suggests that both generations are eager to pursue entrepreneurial chances. 
This has the implication that both gen Y and gen Z entrepreneurs have enormous potential to be successful business 
owners. Education and training can be administered in the same manner to these two generations because of their 
entrepreneurial similarities. They have various risk-taking characteristics. This indicates that the mentorship program 
is ineffective for gen Z, whereas gen Y needs a mentor as a role model. During their business journey, Gen Z merely 
needs to be provided with several resources and opportunities to enable them develop independently. They require the 
expert coach after encountering challenges. 
6. Conclusion
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether entrepreneurs from generations Y and Z have distinct 
levels of entrepreneurial orientation based on innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactivity. The study analyzed the data 
collected from 389 young entrepreneurs using closed-ended questionnaires using the Rasch Model. Innovativeness 
and proactiveness did not differ significantly between the two individuals, according to the findings of this study. 
However, the key finding of this study is that the risk-taking abilities of entrepreneurs from generations Y and Z differ 
dramatically. 
The findings of this study reveal that both gen Y and gen Z entrepreneurs have enormous potential for entrepreneurial 
success. The results of this study provided new light on entrepreneurial education for these two generations. Education 
and training can be administered in the same manner to these two generations because of their entrepreneurial 
similarities. The mentorship program is ineffective for Gen Z; instead, they should be supplied with various resources 
and opportunities to assist them learn independently throughout their entrepreneurial path. 
A weakness of this study is that only Greater Jakarta data were collected. A number of questions remain unanswered. 
First, comparative research on the entrepreneurial performance of entrepreneurs from generations Y and Z is required. 
Second, additional research is required to determine the optimal approach for developing these two generations.

Abstract 
The implementation of Ergonomics principles in small scale industries (SSIs) helps to overcome the issues related to 
musculoskeletal disorders, postural stress, overall work environment and layout. In most of the SSIs several 
ergonomic deficiencies are found to exist such as bad workstation design, postural stress, incompatibility between 
workers and equipment, excessive noise, heat and poor illumination, layout problems and prevalence of 
musculoskeletal disorders. The objective of the present study is to identify the ergonomic deficiencies in SSI 
aluminum utensil manufacturing industries in Karnataka, and to suggest suitable low cost ergonomic interventions 
for reducing the worker discomfort and productivity improvement.  A preliminary study and observations revealed 
the workers are exposed to postural stress due to repetitive tasks involving bending, twisting, load carrying, 
stretching, contact stress, noise and vibrations. The industry also suffered from bad layout design resulting in 
unnecessary delays, bottlenecks and backtracking. The work consists of melting, rolling, sheet cutting, press work, 
trimming, polishing and packaging which involve frequent bending, twisting, stretching, and contact stress, carrying 
load, vibrations and excessive noise. The methodology adapted for the study includes administering modified Body 
Discomfort Survey, ergonomic assessment tools like Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), Rapid Entire Body 
Assessment (REBA) and Digital Human Modeling using CATIA. The results of body discomfort survey indicated 
discomfort in the range of 60% to 80% in upper back, shoulder, lower back, wrist and elbows. The RULA analysis 
showed around 48% of postures assessed are in high risk and REBA analysis showed about 55% postures are in high 
and very high risk categories respectively. The workstation at spinning and polishing machines are modeled in 
CATIA and changes in the workstation are demonstrated. The human manikin built around the improved 
workstation considering the anthropometric dimensions, is analyzed using RULA and it gives a decrease in risk 
levels from a high risk category (score 7) to low (score 3) at polishing machine and medium risk (score 5) at 
spinning lathe. Further improvements can be made by application of ergonomic principle to reduce the postural 
stress and discomfort and increase productivity.

Abstract 
Micro EDM is a versatile process that is effectively used for machining hard and difficult-to-cut materials including 
superalloy. It is a recently developed process for producing micro-parts with dimensions ranging from 50 to 1000 
µm. Micro-EDM is a cost-effective machining technology for creating a micro-metal hole that is used in orthopedic 
implants. In this work, Micro EDM experiments are carried out on the material Ti-6Al-4V. This material finds wide 
applications in biomedical industries for making dental bone replacement applications. Low-frequency Vibrations 
have been applied to remove the debris from the machining zone. A brass tool of 400 µm diameter is used as a tool 
electrode material. Micromachining (Micro drilling) is a challenging task because of the small size of the tool. In 
this work, micro drilling has been attempted with 400 microns tool and thereof tool wear and hole quality have been 
investigated. The detailed investigation of MRR (MRR), TWR (TWR), Surface Roughness (Ra), and Overcut (OC) 
have been carried out using Micro-structural analysis, SEM Studies, and EDS analysis. It is found that various 
parameters have some effects on the hole quality and tool wear. An attempt has been made to find out optimum 
parameter settings using statistical tools and the Design of experiments.

1. Introduction
Micro EDM is a versatile process that is effectively used for machining hard and difficult-to-cut materials. In this 
machining process, the machine removes material at a very small level smaller than 100 m. The amount of 
electricity required is very low in micro EDM than in other EDM since the machining takes place at very nano or 
micro levels. Micro-EDM is used in machining techniques such as micro-wire EDM, micro-EDM drilling, and 
micro-EDM milling. Micro-wire EDM uses a wire with a diameter of less than 20 m. Other micro-EDM 
technologies have minimum machinability of 5 m for cavities. Micro EDM properties are influenced by the grain 
sizes of workpiece materials.

EDM is a very versatile process it is used in the machining of various materials. This research aims to utilize Micro 
EDM for machining of Bio Materials and analyze the effect of machining on the behavior of the material in various 
aspects. The Titanium alloy has a very refined grain structure thus it may provide us with the required surface finish. 
Also, the applications require accurate machining which can be done on Micromachining. Very less research is 
being carried out at such a micro level of machining because of various challenges in the making of tools and 
availability of machines, thus it is needed to carry out further research in the area of micromachining in general and 
Micro EDM in specific.

From the above images (Figure 12-15 ) taken from Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), it is evident that a 
significant amount of tool wear deposits are accumulated in the hole. They can contribute to changes in the chemical 
behavior of the base material and may not provide accurate results. 
 
EDS analysis shows the chemical composition of the workpiece and the chemical composition of the tool deposited 
in the hole. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The main conclusions that are observed during the experiments are as follows: 
• 
The most significant parameter observed is Capacitance for MRR and TWR and Overcut is most 
significantly dependent on Voltage variations. 
• 
As MRR is higher the better, it is found that it increases with Voltage and Vibrations and decreases with 
Capacitance and rotational speed. 
• 
For TWR, it is lower the better thus it decreases with a decrease in Capacitance and increases with an 
increase in Voltage, rotational speed, and Vibrations. 
• 
Overcut implies Dimensional Accuracy of the Hole, thus it should be lower as possible which is obtained 
when Voltage and Capacitance increase but decreases with an increase in speed and Vibrations. 
• 
Brass has good electrical conductivity and bending strength, it is a good option as a microelectrode 
material.

Abstract 
In this paper, a different approach for software test automation of automotive Electronic Controller Unit is 
proposed where automation tool is based on the LabVIEW and TestStand platform. Canoe is used for simulation 
of environment. Parameters of ECU is accessed using XCP protocol. Communication between LabVIEW and 
Canoe is established using FDX i.e., Fast Data Exchange. FDX works on UDP protocol. CAN signals cannot be 
directly accessed by LabVIEW with use of FDX only hence CAPL node is used for accessing CAN signals in 
case of Unified Diagnostics Service related testcases. Hardware is integrated using VT system.

1. Introduction
Today product development of Mechatronics systems in automotive sector is consist of many phases like 
mechanical design, software design, development, integration, testing, etc. Testing is major part in a product 
development cycle. There is need to increase the efficiency in product testing and to make the process more 
productive and increase the quality of testing while being cost effective and less time consuming (Kumar et al. 
2018). In product development cycle of automotive world let’s consider case of any Electronic Controller Unit of 
body module, the software which is flashed in ECU needs to be tested many times before final release (Vinaya 
2020). Many companies follow method of manual testing using different testing tools which requires more time 
and there are chances of human error in testing (Yuan et al. 2012). As some projects come along with short span 
of development cycle it is important to submit Test Report as soon as possible (Tarik 2015). For that purpose, 
companies are seeking software testing tools that offer a comprehensive solution that helps in achieving above 
requirements. 
In coming days as well as today also in automotive industry lot of comfort features are getting introduced in cars. 
Different power operated modules are introduced with lot of functionalities (Rajashree et al. 2016, . For such 
products testing is also needed and to gain efficiency in testing different industries are trying to automate 
hardware test as well as software test. New mechatronics systems are complex has lot of I/O channels and also 
works on different types of protocols along with real time control (Jenny et al. 2019, Eun et al. 2009, Dietmar et 
al. 2014, Claus et al. 2017). A test automation tool that will perform test of functionalities of DUT is highly 
desirable for this, mainly to achieve high level accuracy, precision and to reduce time! 
 In this test automation LabVIEW is used along with TestStand and Canoe. Test sequences are written in the 
excel sheet using different key words.

5. Advantage 
• Automation tests get recorded and this allows you to reuse and execute the same kind of testing and 
repetitive tasks multiple times 
• After scripts and configuration, test automation requires less time and resources to execute defined scope, 
compared to manual testing 
• Consistent test runs hence we get reliable and consistent results 
• Less error caused by human mistake 
• No manual error in the test.  
• Overnight test is possible and hence resource utilization will be better for organization. 
• High reusability of the test case reduces development time (Table 2)

6. Future Scope 
1. Initially these mapped signals, definitions and testcases are written for project “A”. If the definitions and 
testcases are written in a generic way then after some modifications it is possible to use same testcases and 
definitions for other projects also. Which will reduce development time of the testcase and definitions. 
2. In the end of the testcase graph of selected variables can be introduced in the report. Which will be 
useful for identification of the exact reason of failure in case of failed testcase.

three out of four Disability categories, for elderly, physically challenged, visually impaired, auditory impaired, and 
people with some degree of motor inability. The Preliminary design is the result of the study of an actual site, 
understanding the requirements of four major disability types, their ergonomics, available assistive devices, and 
literature review. In addition, other factors like the disability act, user equipment regulations, user safety, emergencies, 
and operational requirements of lift were studied. The first part of this paper is the mechanical design, actuation design 
with the capacity to lift one ""wheel-chaired"" person (or any differently challenged person) along with an assistant in 
case available. Scissor-type electro-hydraulic actuated design takes care of 500 kg., Safe load for 02-meter lifting 
height, supported by FEA results. For Voice command operation experiments, used ATmega328P microcontroller, 
SPCE061A Sound controller, APR33A3, USB-TTL, HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, and LCD. Used ""Access 
port"" and ""HTerm"" software. Recorded and tested 05 commands to drive the test motor & LED signals for defined 
logic. The paper includes a block diagram and flow diagram of lift Operation. This paper details the experiments for 
voice recording & playback, voice recognition using SPCE061A, the software for voice commands input, and usable 
format conversion and testing of 05 commands to operate the motor. The paper consists of hardware information, 
methods, and connections of hardware used during the experiments, step-by-step processes, and cases of logic, failure 
and success of the techniques before the final results.

1. Introduction
As per WHO 2011 report, 1 billion out of 7.87 billion population in the world are (one or other way) disabled. Out of 
the 70 million total world population, 12.7% have disabilities of varied nature, 3.2% have a visual disability, 6% have 
auditory, 2.6% people have an intellectual disability, and 1 % have a physical disability.2.2% of the Indian population 
has some form of disability as per the census 2011. Other than the elderly, there are people with temporary or 
permanent disability types, like locomotors disability, leprosy cured person, cerebral palsy, dwarfism, and chronic 
neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. There are 1.2 lack wheelchair users in 
India as per financial express, dated 06th August 2012, and are growing by 10% every 03 years. This world requires 
easy accessible and safe equipment or facilities for residential buildings, old age homes, hospitals, malls, theatres, bus 
stands, train stations, airports, and commercial buildings. UN survey 2005 conducted across 114 countries found 
policies on accessibility, but 37 countries were without progress. And from these countries, 54% did not follow 
accessibility standards for outdoor environments, 43% did not have public buildings, and 44% did not have schools, 
health facilities & other public service buildings. The awareness and the government regulations in India found a place 
only after the “Accessible India Campaign” launched on 3rd December 2015. The Accessibility features like standard 
ramps, non-slippery walkways, signage, disabled-friendly toilets, helpdesks, and lifts with Braille & auditory 
information systems are presently well described. Laws and Regulations for Persons with Disability are available now. 
“The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (41. Access to transport) and Access Audits of Public Buildings 
& Places recommended in India since 2015. UNE EN 81-41:2011 is a European Standards for Safety rule for the 
construction and installation of lifts, Special lifts for the movement of persons and goods. ASME A17 and A18 
references are applicable for installations in the United States & CSA B-44, and B355 references are applicable for 
installations in Canada. ADA compliance is a US civil law for the disabled. It is the “Americans with Disabilities Act” 
for Accessible Design. This means all electronic, IT, and Products must be accessible to those with disabilities.

Introduction
Environment is one of the important aspects of our lives where the existence of an environment can have various 
impacts both socially and economically. Recently, rapid developments in various sectors of life, especially in the 
economic and social sectors have had many impacts on the environmental situation. However, the current 
environmental situation is becoming an issue of discussion in various circles. The number of activities carried out by 
humans has given many side effects to environmental conditions. According to Sudarmo et al. (2020) sourced from 
data from the DKI Jakarta Government stated that the amount of plastic waste contained in Bantar Gebang waste 
processing has reached 39 million tons in 2019 where 34% percent of the waste is dominated by plastic waste. 
In tackling the problems related to environmental pollution described above, various companies in Indonesia have 
begun to think about the various impacts generated by the company's operational activities that can affect 
environmental conditions. As a step for the company to build and reduce environmental impact, the company 
implements CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) as a form of corporate responsibility in tackling the environment 
current condition. One method of realizing the implementation of CSR is through the application of Environmental 
Accounting in the Company's Financial Statements. Implementation of Environmental Accounting in real work 
requires self-awareness from each individual, known as environmental awareness. In general, students who take 
accounting classes and study environmental accounting show an increase in knowledge of students' environmental 
awareness which can have a significant influence on the environmental awareness behavior of today's young 
generation (Hauptman et al. 2016).

Based on the Table above, it can be seen that the t-count value for pro-environmental behavior variable is 2.228 > t-
Table is 1.98045 with a sign value. 0.0028 < 0.005. This shows that the pro-environmental behavior variable has a 
significant effect on environmental awareness. The results of the study are in accordance with the ‘Planned Behavior’ 
theory which shows that there are various factors (knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms) that can shape Pro-
Environmental behavior where the adopted behavior will increase one's awareness of an issue so that it can have a 
significant impact on one's awareness to aware of and understand the importance of environmental conservation today. 
The results of this study are in line with research according to (Niankara and Zoungrana. 2018, Bamberg 2003; 
Kagawa 2007; Boyes et al. 2008 and Michalos et al. 2009 in Zsóka. A et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2020, Dono et al. 2010) 
showed that pro-environmental behavior had a significant influence on environmental awareness. With this, the results 
show that H2 is accepted. The hypothesis is accepted shows that students have understood and implemented pro-
environmental behavior where the formation of these behaviors will increase students' environmental awareness. 
 
Based on the Table above, it can be seen that the t-count value for GoGreenApp Usage variable is 2.393 > t-Table is 
1.98045 with a sign value. 0.0018 < 0.005. This shows GoGreenApp Usage have a significant effect on environmental 
awareness. The results of this study are in accordance with the grand theory in this study, namely ‘The Planned 
Behavior’ which explains that with the various factors that shape a person's behavior, one of which is an interest in 
using a mobile application, it will encourage the individual to use a go-green-based mobile application that will 
provide significant effect on environmental awareness of the individual. The results of this study are in line with 
research according to (Chang et al. 2011, Fernández-López et al. 2013, Khan et al. 2015) showing that the adoption 
of technology in the form of applications related to environmental conservation has a significant impact on 
environmental awareness of students. With this, the results show that H3 is accepted. The hypothesis is accepted 
shows that knowing and using go-green-based mobile applications can help increase students' environmental 
awareness. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the research above, it can be concluded that environmental accounting, pro-understanding, 
environmental behavior, and go-green-based applications usage show significant results on environmental awareness 
among accounting students. Conclusions are presented as follows: 
1. Based on the conclusions above, it can be explained that with environmental accounting understanding and the 
importance for companies to protect the surrounding environment by managing waste and applying environmental 
management accounting, it can help accounting students understand the importance of implementing environmental 
accounting for companies to meet the company's business sustainability. 
2. Pro-environmental behavior is measured by various indicators and factors that shape pro-environmental behavior 
so that it can be explained that individuals who have adopted pro-environmental behavior will help increase awareness 
of the environment both for themselves and for the common good. 
3. In carrying out environmental conservation, knowledge and real adoption are needed in realizing these activities. 
The presence of go-green-based applications can help everyone increase environmental awareness by using 
applications that help recycle plastic waste and reduce the use of paper waste to reduce the accumulation of plastic 
waste and minimize excessive deforestation.

Abstract 
The emergence of global social isolation in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of e-
commerce to a high level, that allowed companies to become more technologically aware of customer management, 
moving from a traditional system to a modern one. However, this change has not been carried out in a drastic way, 
and even not completely, because the Peruvian commercial environment is difficult to penetrate, and it is complicated 
to displace the already established sales channels. Therefore, in this research, data was collected from the main e-
commerce companies in the Peruvian market, at the national level (Falabella Peru and Ripley Peru), to demonstrate 
the importance of social media management as a factor promoting repurchase intention and that, consequently, it is 
an important aspect to consider during the elaboration of loyalty models in organizations. For this reason, a survey 
was used as a data collection tool and the information obtained was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling with 
IBM SPSS AMOS software. Given this, the most relevant result obtained was that social media activities have a 
positive and significant effect on repurchase intention. On the contrary, brand equity and customer relationship have 
a positive relationship, but not as relevant for repurchase intention.

1. Introduction
Due to the advance and spread of the Covid-19 disease, the World Health Organization (2020) decided to declare a 
global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Specifically, in Peru, the country registered a mortality rate of 4.02% and ranked 
seventh internationally among countries with the highest number of positive cases (Mejía et al., 2020). In response to 
these statistics, the Peruvian government implemented quarantine and social distancing policies (Córdova-Aguilar et 
al., 2020), which led to traffic restrictions and the closure of businesses.  
Those measures implemented, according to the Peruvian Chamber of Electronic Commerce (2021), forced ""businesses 
to boost their online sales, which led to a 50% growth in e-commerce in 2020; that is, a 300% increase in the number 
of e-commerce shipments and a 400% increase in the number of new companies that entered the electronic industry"" 
(Neo Consulting, 2021). It is also important to recognize that, in the report made by Neo Consulting, an increase of 
approximately double the number of Peruvian online shoppers as a result of the emergence of the pandemic (Neo 
Consulting, 2021).  
Given the impact of COVID-19, e-commerce accelerated 5 years in only 3 months, where the growth of e-commerce 
retail stands out, which grew by 250% (Peruvian Chamber of Electronic Commerce, 2021). Therefore, within the 
analysis in this research, the behavior of consumers of the main online stores belonging to this sector, Falabella and 
Ripley, will be studied. According to the report prepared by Neo Consulting (2021), both e-commerce companies 
maintain the leadership in the traffic of the main retailers, compared to Oechsle, Sodimac and Promart.  
1783","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

since given the pandemic caused by COVID-19, emphasis has been placed on marketing strategies employed in a 
digital environment, primarily due to the great influence of social networks in online purchases (Dubbelink, 2021). 
On the one hand, Falabella Peru maintains an engagement in its followers of 0.15% on Instagram, 8% on TikTok and 
0.072% on Facebook; on the other hand, Ripley Peru maintains the following values: 0.092% on Instagram and 
0.046% on Facebook (Fanpage Karma). The percentage of follower engagement is relevant, since through it, it can 
have an impact on BV, by expanding the reach of the content and facilitating long-term brand loyalty (Zailskaite-
Jakste and Minelgaite, 2021), which would explain the positive influence between both variables. Additionally, as for 
the positive impact on repurchase intention, it would also be understood, because for e-commerce studied, around 4% 
of the traffic to their online shopping platform is driven by social networks (SimilarWeb).  
 
On the contrary, for the population studied and the characteristics of the sample, SM does not have a positive effect 
on CR. That result differs from what was found in Maskuroh et al. (2022), since the study explains that the influence 
of social media marketing was higher in the variable of relationship with customers, considering that the participants 
of their research realized in Indonesia. Therefore, the results obtained can be explained by the behavior of the Peruvian 
consumer, since the relationship with customers analyzes the way in which a given company approaches consumers, 
specifically through communication with them. Given that, in social networks, messages are transmitted through 
publications containing videos or photos, and in the case of the retails selected for the study, they maintain an 
interaction in their publications of less than 0.045%, (Fanpage Karma,) this indicator could justify the result obtained.  
Regarding the variables that affect the repurchase intention (RI), first of all, the brand value (BV) presents a positive 
effect on the RI, which could be caused by the positive impact that SM had on the BV, as well as the great significance 
of the SM on the RI. Therefore, it could be explained by the fact that BV mediates or drives the relationship between 
SM and IR. Therefore, the BV variable does not have an incredibly significant effect on IR. Secondly, CR presents a 
direct relationship; however, the result obtained is not as significant as for the other variables with which the 
relationship has been analyzed. It should also be noted that the model obtained, and its interpretation is similar to the 
results of the study by Maskuroh et al. (2022), which concluded, based on the values obtained in their model, that this 
variable does not represent a significant influence on IR. 
 
6. Conclusion 
H1: There is an effect of social media activities on repurchase intention.  
According to the model analyzed, it can be concluded that there is an effect of social media activities on repurchase 
intention in an e-commerce company, and that, moreover, this influence is significantly positive. As previously 
explained in the numerical results, the management of social networks presents a direct effect estimate of 1.35 on 
repurchase intention, and also shows a regression weight of 0.561, the highest of all the proposed paths. Therefore, 
the importance of implementing the use of social networks for pre- and post-sales processes as a driver of the 
repurchase intention indicator can be deduced.  
  
H2: There is an effect of the relationship with the customer on repurchase intention.  
The results obtained allow us to affirm that there is a non-significant positive direct effect of customer relationship on 
repurchase intention, this is supported by the fact that, when analyzing the direct effects table, an estimate of 0.016 is 
found for this path. Furthermore, once the regression weight is reviewed, an estimate of 0.048 is found, which is of 
little importance compared to the rest of the variables.  
  
H3: There is an effect of brand value on repurchase intention.  
Regarding the third hypothesis, it is concluded that there is an effect of brand value on repurchase intention. Although 
the influence is positive, this does not represent the ideal path, as it remains with a relatively low direct effect estimate 
(0.20) and an even lower regression weight (0.126). This indicates that brand value is not a variable that can be directly 
considered as a factor influencing repurchase intention.  
  
H4: There is an effect of social media activities on customer relationship.  
Although the relationship with the customer is not related to repurchase intention, the bond with the consumer is 
influenced indirectly by social networks, since it is a consequence of social network behavior. The table of direct 
effects explains that the estimate for both variables is -1, which allows us to understand that while one rises, the other 
tends to fall. On the other hand, in the revision of the regression weight, it is found that this indirect effect is negative 
and insignificant, having an estimate value of -0.138.

H5: There is an effect of social media activities on brand value.  
Analyzing the relationship between BV and SM with a 0.659 regression weight, it can be deduced that there is an 
effect of social networking behavior on perceived brand value. As previously explained, this indicates that, since there 
is a direct connection with the SM variable, it is deduced that the link with repurchase intention is indirect and therefore 
it is not suggested to consider BV as a promoter of IR.  
 
Finally, it is concluded with this scientific article that it is feasible to analyze the behavior of social networks in a Latin 
American environment during the pandemic and that such data can be applied in a practical mathematical model of 
equations, which confirms the theory stated at the beginning: digital marketing, specifically the use of social networks 
in pre- and post-sales processes, should be considered as a primary factor during the elaboration of repurchase models 
in e-commerce companies. This is because it seeks to ensure the loyalty of the new generation of consumers through 
digitalized, simple and eye-catching channels that not only promote the shopping culture, but also encourage interest 
in commercial development, continuous growth and competition in the retail market itself.

Abstract 
Healthcare organizations implement the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology to achieve performance in terms of 
cost, quality, and productivity. The purpose of this paper is to implement LSS in the casualty of a private hospital in 
India to mitigate the issue of high turnaround time (TAT) of the blood samples. The DMAIC (Define-Measure-
Analyse-Improve-Control) strategy was utilized as the model of problem-solving during LSS implementation. A 
team comprising two doctors, three nursing staff, and two support staff was formed to carry out the project. In this 
work, we found that multiple variables could impact the high TAT of the blood samples in casualty, thereby 
prolonging the patient stay and crowding. In a phased manner, the casualty workforce under the guidance of the LSS 
professional could able to utilize the power of simple LSS tools like Process Flow Map, Ishikawa Diagram, SIPOC, 
5-Why analysis, SPC, etc, to find the root causes and take corrective actions during the implementation process. As
a result, the average TAT is reduced from 164 minutes to a new average of 84 minutes. This study was restricted to
a specific area in a multispecialty hospital in India. Hence the validity can be built on by including other
departments in the same hospital or doing similar studies in other hospitals. The findings will empower the
researchers, professionals, and managers in the healthcare sector to incorporate a similar way of hands-on training
and simultaneous LSS implementation for continuous process improvement.

1. Introduction
Timely and effective care is essential for good patient outcomes in any healthcare organization. Delays in providing 
timely care to patients in the casualty can reduce the quality of care and increase risks and discomfort for patients 
with serious illnesses or injuries and this issue will lead to crowding. Crowding is an increasingly common 
occurrence in hospital-based casualties across the globe (Vashi et al., 2019). Hospitals continue to face growing 
problems with crowding, delays in providing various services, and cost containment (Vashi et al., 2019)). In 
particular, patient wait times for getting the laboratory test results in the casualty have come under scrutiny (Busby 
et al., 2013).  
The foremost part of a clinical laboratory is to produce consistent, reproducible, valid, timely, and correctly 
interpreted test results to help in clinical decision-making. To attain this goal, laboratories should essentially create 
and sustain quality in all laboratory procedures, while concentrating on cost-effectiveness. Presently, clinical 
laboratories need to handle the raising workloads with the same or fewer number of staff and must still supply 
constant results with improved turnaround times (TATs) and with supreme quality. Even though there are multiple

5. Discussion  
The laboratory turnaround time is one of the important factors which influence the course of management in patients 
visiting casualties. Thus, reducing the laboratory turnaround time will improve the efficiency of the entire unit and 
result in better patient outcomes. Well-designed laboratories that were accredited by certain agencies will not 
guarantee to provide quality service without delays and defects. LSS strategy is a viable method for improving the 
laboratory turnaround time. In our study we found that using the LSS strategy, the lab turnaround time was 
significantly reduced by more than 1 hour. This was brought about by an effective DMAIC strategy under the LSS 
approach. A cause-and-effect fishbone diagram was used in the process. The standard deviation of the turnaround 
time was also reduced from 10 minutes to 8 minutes signifying that the variability in the turnaround time had 
decreased. Successful implementation of LSS produces beneficial outcomes in terms of cost-effectiveness, higher 
process quality, and better operational efficiency. This study demonstrated that the application of the LSS strategy is 
a feasible strategy to improve laboratory turnaround time in casualty and that the same can be used for quality 
improvement in similar settings.  
 
6. Conclusion and Limitations 
The TAT is an important parameter in effective patient care, especially in the setting of a casualty. This study aimed 
to reduce the TAT based on the DMAIC approach used in LSS. It is seen that every single aspect of DMAIC has 
been successfully applied to the whole laboratory process in the casualty. After the successful implementation of 
quality-improvement strategies, the TAT showed significant improvements and process stability during the study 
period. The reasons for the delay in lab processing time were also identified and rectified during the process. It was 
observed that the laboratory turnaround time was reduced significantly. The findings from this study demonstrated 
that DMAIC methods can be used in a different setting to obtain significant improvement in the process. 
 
There were some limitations in our study. First, this study was conducted in a single hospital and the findings may 
not be generalized to all institutions as they have a different SOP, manpower, etc. for the laboratory process. 
However, it has to be noted that our findings and implementation of the LSS strategy may be of importance to

another similar laboratory that aims at quality improvement. Second, we did not assess changes in the overall length 
of stay of the patient in the casualty or the patient satisfaction following the DMAIC strategy implementation. 
However, a decrease in TAT is likely to decrease the overall stay of the patient in the casualty.

Abstract 
The aim of any maintenance plan is to improve machine availability. Modern manufacturing involves complicated 
machines and high levels of automation. The goal of automated equipment is to increase production rates while 
improving quality. As a result, machines must be kept in working order to deliver the desired outcome or goal. 
Machine failures or breakdowns cause production to be disrupted, resulting in the present system's availability 
being lost. This influences the production, expense of maintenance and commitment to customer. The present 
work aims at increasing operational availability of the Machines. One engine block manufacturing system 
consisting of three lines, each line having no of machines, a few critical machines were identified on the criteria 
of capacity and breakdowns and these breakdowns were analysed with FMEA, RCA, Why-Why analysis, etc. 
Implementation is in the form of a customised maintenance plan that reduces the breakdown and shifts the 
maintenance from reactive to proactive. The following parameters like MTTR, MTBF and Machine Uptime % 
and the production quantity were compared with previous year data in CMMS. The implemented maintenance 
plan helps to improve production rate and the machine operational availability. 
Keywords  
Operational availability, MTTR, MTBF, FMEA, Pareto analysis, and Maintenance. 
1. Introduction
The ultimate purpose of maintenance is to offer optimal dependability that satisfies the firm's business 
requirements, with reliability defined as the percentage of failure-free performance for a specified period of time 
under specified conditions. Downtime has been a result of asset/machinery failure (Kolte and Dabhade; 2017). 
Equipment maintenance is becoming more important in industry as a result of the requirement to improve 
dependability and reduce the risk of productivity loss due to machine failure. The equipment availability/uptime 
is also known as the time for which it is completely functioning. The initial two thoughts that if a plant is running 
for 24 hours and 3 shifts for all seven days, It should have maximum output and for doing that, the training of the 
employees is a must, so that they can work with the best way of that particular plant, depending upon their training, 
depending upon their skills,  they might operate the equipment, will use machines machinery, so that it can perform 
the best outputs . To avoid breakdown, we need to have a very proper robust planning of preventive maintenance 
that could fore see that what Is the maintenance requirement of this particular equipment. It is a very difficult task 
as one must keep balance in between the two factors those are frequency, duration of maintenance and the cost of 
maintenance. These factors are also very important when planning preventive maintenance (jishu hozen 
implementation. manual no.1 2000). The relationship between preventive maintenance and breakdown 
maintenance is if more efforts are put in preventive, then cost of breakdown maintenance decreases. Maintenance

The overall average operational availability of Haas-1 machine was improved by 10 percent, Haas-2 machine was 
improved by 16 percent and Haas-3 machine by 01 percent. 
6. Conclusion
As a result of this study, we conclude that the percent Uptime or Availability of the machine for production is 
critical in meeting production goals, and that we must reduce machine breakdowns in order to raise the percent 
Uptime. To reduce breakdowns, we must first analyse the current condition of any machine we are studying, as 
well as previous breakdown data, to determine the major breakdown areas and what solutions (maintenance work) 
were given/taken at the time, and then conduct analysis (FMEA, etc.) to determine the cause and effect of the 
breakdown, followed by developing an action plan to address those breakdowns by repairing, replacing, or 
updating the required, and tracking the data of these machines.

Abstract 
An evaporative air cooler's tendency to get more humid after some period of operation is one of its main issues. and 
there is not much work is done on making it automatically operate. To address this issue, an IoT-based Smart 
Evaporative air cooler with humidity control has been developed. This paper introduces a method which maintains 
the humidity in the human comfort zone. An algorithm is developed by analysing data from the dht22 humidity and 
temperature measurement sensor in which instead of the pump operating continuously it operated intermittently. To 
connect air cooler to the internet, ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is used. so that when you will be away from home you 
wanted a cool room you can turn on the water cooler before entering a home. Arduino Uno microcontroller with 
Atmega328P chip, Water Level Depth Detection Sensor for Arduino, and Relay is used. This technique makes it very 
convenient for the user to control air cooler by using a mobile phone, while keeping the humidity within the Human 
comfort zone.

Abstract 
Corporate training is essential for employee upskilling and reskilling. Companies invest huge amounts in the 
development of training pathways. It has a direct impact on employee productivity and efficiency. Many organizations 
have a set of mandatory compliance-related training for new employees to avoid compliance issues. Tracking this 
training status is a tedious task. The Human Resource Learning & Development team makes available many courses 
for employee upskilling and reskilling but whether the employees are using these training for their upskilling is a 
challenging task to track. Organizations also like to know many insights like - How much progress the employee has 
made on assigned training? What portion of total employees have completed the particular section of assigned 
training? Etc. In this situation, soft automation using modern Microsoft tools, mainly Power Query and Power 
Automate are useful tools that simplify the problem. In this paper, it is demonstrated that the use of automation 
techniques using these tools can help to track corporate training and improve the training completion rate of the 
employees thereby creating good opportunities for their growth. This automaton will also save an enormous amount 
of time as compared to manual tracking. This research paper is applicable to all sectors since training is part of all 
corporate learning programs. Corporate companies can leverage this automated training tracking mechanism to upskill 
their employees. 
Keywords 
Upskilling of Resources, Compliance trainings, Efforts to track training, Power Automate, and power query. 
1. Introduction
In the modern era of globalization, things change rapidly and continuously. There are frequent and regular updates in 
tools and technology, laws, methods, etc. To withstand these challenges, there is constant need to improve and learn 
the new technologies and concepts (Cukir.W.,2020). The organization creates e-learning pathways to reskill/upskill 
their employees based on their needs. Learning pathway is described as the chosen route taken by a learner through a 
range of (commonly) e-learning activities, which allows them to build knowledge progressively (Jih, 1996), (Iofciu et 
al., 2012). Nowadays, e-trainings are most preferred method by corporate companies due to their agile and scalable

5. Results and Discussion
The final training summary report prepared using Excel Power Query can be updated with only one click (Power 
Query documentation, 2022). To update the training summary, just swap out the outdated completion reports for each 
pathway in the Dump folder with the most recent reports available from the online learning platform at the time of 
refresh. Power query will perform all back-end activities and load the finished report into Excel in a matter of minutes. 
Summary report can also be prepared using vanilla excel. i.e. using conventional excel formulae. But creating it using 
plain excel formula has a major drawback that for every refresh we need to put manual efforts to create similar 
summary report which we created using power query. This would take minimum 2-3 hours depending upon the 
number of data files (in this case it will be number of pathways) we are collating. Apart from this, there are chances 
of errors since manual report creation requires attention to detail every time one creates a report. Similarly, manually 
nudging employees for training completions take significant amount of time. Using Power Automate, nudge can be 
sent to large number of employees within fraction of seconds. Since, these are the scheduled reminders from Power 
Automate, there will be no delay and no chances of missing reminder for any employee. The below table 1 summarizes 
the approximate time saved using conventional and proposed tracking mechanism. 
Table 1. Summary of Time saving using suggested method 
From the results, it is found that using Excel Power Query, the % time saved is by 87.5% for refreshing training 
reports. Additionally, the % time saved is by 94.4% to send nudge notifications to employees for training completion 
using Power Automate. 
From the research work, it is observed that the methodology adopted could improve the learning completion rates of 
the employees and moreover it enhanced the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organization. 
6. Conclusion
The most important asset of any organization are the employees. Learning and development of the employees is 
directly related to the retention of employees in the organization. Therefore, tracking the training of employees is 
becoming critical task. By application of Power Automate and Power Query, completion and progress tracking has 
become manageable. Moreover, the extra efforts of senior employees are saved if the trainings are given to the junior 
employees by e-learning portals. This improves the overall efficiency and effectiveness of all the employees working 
in the organization. The time is saved and efforts are aligned on other significant activities. To conclude, effective e-
learning has become mandatory for organizations in global environment of businesses and project management 
technique of tracking the completion and progress of learning of employees will help the organizations increase the 
chance of success in their future endeavors.

Abstract 
Nowadays, having an accurate demand forecast is extremely important as it allows the company to manage resources 
in an optimal way and thus achieve greater productivity. There is a large demand for accurate forecasting, and utilizing 
artificial intelligence can help companies gain a better understanding of their market. In this research presentation, 
Machine Learning (ML) is used to optimize demand forecasting. The data collected was trained and due to the 
available data rate, the Cross-Validation technique was used to avoid overfitting. Using time-series, it will be possible 
to predict future sales for the first trimester of 2021. Finally, the impact of the ML tool on the deviation of the 
company's demand forecast was evaluated using indicators of accuracy (forecast accuracy) and bias (forecast bias). 
Keywords 
Demand Forecast; Machine Learning; Forecast Accuracy; Forecast Bias and Consumers Good Company. 
1. Introduction
Due to the importance of an accurate demand forecast, the former Head of Demand Planning at the company was 
consulted. His explanation was given and will be utilized for the case study. The real name of the company will be 
omitted for the study due to confidentiality issues. Instead, the name Company DEOS will be used to refer to the 
company, and Demand Chief will be used to refer to the former Head of the Demand Planning team. Demand Chief 
(2021), indicates that: ""demand forecasting is the mind of the business. It is the analytical portion of the solution. The 
forecast shows is believed to be what can be done and sold, for justified reasons, taking into account what has happened 
or what is known to occur, the forecast is made"". In the case of a consumer goods company (CGC), these are affected 
by having an excessive number of products that do not rotate or a shortage of products due to high rotation. As Aktepe 
et al. (2021) mention: ""Although inventories appear to be owned by the company, they have no return unless they are 
sold. Oversupplied raw materials for a production company occupy machinery and workers, creating additional labor 
costs as well as purchase costs.""  Excess inventory translates into a loss. Either due to excess or lack of inventories, it 
results in expired products and reduced sales. The main causes for an inaccurate demand forecast are the lack of data, 
unreliable data, peaks in demand, and the failure of taking into account life cycles. In addition, there is a great 
dependence on distributors because the vast majority of CGC sells their products to them so they can then sell it to the 
final consumer. 
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of this research is to improve the accuracy of the forecast of the monthly demand for deodorants in a 
CGC through the implementation of an alternative forecasting model and ML.

It can be seen in Table 11 that using the alternative and ML models the FB is above the result with the current method 
in January and March. This means that the proposed models tend to underestimate sales. Underlined are the values 
where the current result was not exceeded. On the other hand, there is a notable improvement in the FA for the entire 
trimester, the results obtained are aligned with the company's policy of having this ratio by 80% or more. The short-
term objective is the implementation of the ML tool in the company. This opportunity for improvement came due to 
the need to use the stored information. As the data analyst in charge of the implementation of the tool for Company 
Deos (Data Scientist Demand) comments, according to Data Scientist Demand (2021): 
 
""previously there was no way to read the data [..] we wanted to see how we could obtain the information 
more efficiently, how to centralize it in a single repository to generate data. We generate information within 
a dataset.  Once we had the information, the next step was to go through a process to find out if it was correct. 
With this, the data quality process was carried out."" 
 
It is worth mentioning that, before making a sales prediction with a forecast model, it is sought to carry out a clustering 
process.  According to Data Scientist Demand (2021): 
 
""With Machine Learning I can make a classification of the wineries to see what type of product is the most 
purchased and launch a specific promotion. Currently we do not have that reading, if we launch a promotion, 
we launch it for everyone; we are not being efficient with the resources we have.""  
 
This point is highly related to one of the causes identified as the most important in generating deviations in the demand 
forecast: Marketing Activities (Figure 1). It is due to non-focused point-of-sale activations without optimization of 
resources that less bias and greater accuracy are not achieved.  
 
5. Conclusion 
It was possible to identify the main causes that affect the monthly forecast and generate a deviation. In general, the 
most relevant causes were Exogenous Factors and Event Analysis (past and future). Specifically for the category of 
deodorants, the main cause identified is Marketing Activities. In addition, a forecast accuracy percentage greater than 
80% was achieved in the first trimester of 2021 (January: 82%, February: 83%, March: 84%). This is aligned with the 
company's goal of having a high value to ensure more accurate forecasts. No expected results were achieved for the 
bias forecast because the models achieved values are outside the desired range of -5% to 5% (January: 16%, February: 
7%, March: 14%). It should be noted that February was the only month that obtained a better result than the current 
method used by the company (7% vs -14%). Finally, the impact that Machine Learning can bring to the company if 
implemented was evaluated; the most outstanding benefit is that existing resources can be channeled to create a good 
marketing and sales strategy at the point of sale, which reduces the main problem of deviation.

Abstract 
Resource management is a prime factor among the various factors driving the industries. It is necessary to utilize the 
resources in best possible way. In service based industries human resources has the tremendous amount of importance, 
as they are the prime contributors in firm’s growth. The stakeholders in these service industries are interested to track 
the utilization of human resources, for tracking the budget they have invested in the firm. The project managers are 
responsible for utilization reporting of FTEs. This paper represents the detailed analysis of resource management in 
the pharmaceutical industries, it has found that the current utilization process has been impacted due to the 
cumbersome method, inefficient tools and these factors were creating excessive utilization of human resources to 
administrate the process. To streamline the process with ease in the handling, increased accuracy and optimum 
resource utilization are the primary objective of this work. For streamlining the process this report has studied the 
various optimization techniques for resource utilization through the available literature resources, the DMAIC 
Methodology was implemented to optimize the current process, with the help of Root cause analysis and SIPOC 
analysis. This work has also derived the key performance indicators to trace the work done by the resources and 
implemented the Project management dashboard to track and visualize the utilization on granular level. With the 
improvement adapted, this work has achieved cost saving of 62% and 59% of time utilized per week.

1. Introduction
In the field of project management cost, time and scope are the primary constraints. These three pillars directly affect 
the quality of the project. Project management plays a crucial role in every project. Resource management is one of 
the key areas of project management. Planned resources have the largest dependency for the completion of project. 
Resources are of different type like human resources, financial resources, material resources, machinery resources and 
information resources. The application of the resources depends on the areas they are getting utilized. In the domain 
of production, material and machinery play a significant role whereas in the field of information technology, 
information and human resources have a major role and for the service based industries, human resources have the 
huge importance. Apart from this financial resources will be connected with each type of industries and projects. The 
department of project management in every industry has the responsibility to track the resources, utilize those

Abstract 
Based on information from the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises that SMEs are the main 
players in the trade sector in Indonesia. However, there is a fact that digital transformation has not been carried out, 
this makes it difficult for these products to be developed in other areas and causes the income of SMEs to fluctuate 
because they are still using conventional methods. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the factors that 
affect brand awareness on adoption of social media marketing using Facebook as the communication media on 
MSME products in Cimanggung Village because it is important for MSME sellers to know customer perceptions of 
MSME products. Quantitative is the method that used by this study with non-probability sampling type purposive 
sampling and data analysis using multiple linear regression. Questionnaires were distributed to 385 Facebook users 
who live in Rancaekek – Cicalengka and follow MSME Facebook accounts in Cimanggung Village. After being 
analyzed, the factors that influence and significantly influence brand awareness on the adoption of social media 
marketing using Facebook as the communication medium on MSME products are Entertainment, Interaction, 
Informativeness, Advertisement, and E-Word of Mouth. These factors were tested using the Classical Assumption 
Test, Linearity Test, Multiple Regression Test, Partial and Simultaneous Test and The Coefficient Determination 
Test. The test shows five factors that have a positive and significant effect to brand awareness of 69.8%.

1. Introduction
 The information technology revolution affects various aspects, one of which is the business aspect. According to 
(Rizaldi and Hidayat, 2020) one of the real impacts of the information technology revolution is the habit of 
marketing communication media from conventional to digital-based or commonly called Social Media Marketing. 
One of the platforms used as a marketing communication medium is Facebook. According to Katadata (2021) 
Indonesia is in the second position as the largest number of Facebook user in Asia, which means that there are 
already many Facebook users in Indonesia, including SMEs. As stated by the Ministry of Finance (2021), the 
government targets 30 million SMEs that market their products digitally in 2030. However, in the SME sector, only 
1.3 million SMEs have entered the digital platform, which means that there are still many SMEs that have not yet 
carried out digital transformation (Kompas 2021) with the main reason being the lack of digital literacy in marketing 
by SME actors. This problem causes sales fluctuations in certain months due to the lack of public awareness of SME 
products that are still marketed using conventional marketing methods. 
1.1 Objectives 
Therefore, this study aims to identify the factor affecting brand awareness on adopt social media marketing with 
facebook as the communication media when applied to SME products by asking the following questions: 
1. What are factors that affecting brand awareness on social media marketing adoption?
2. What is the most influential on brand awareness on social media marketing adoption?

Loyalty"" which is the result is the influence of media advertising Social media on the perception and awareness of 
customer has shows that advertising is a significant part of social media marketing activities  
 
e) E-Word of Mouth.  
Based on Ahmed et al., 2014 contained in the journal Wicaksono and Seminari (2016) electronics word of mouth is 
a the way to get marketing distribution target. Electronics Word of mouth could influence other people, the images 
by theirs, thought, and decision. According to the results, it is known that e-word of mouth is in the very good 
category with a value of 4.37. Advertisement have a positive and significant effects to brand awareness on MSME 
social media. This can be seen from the positive regression coefficient value of 0.818 with a partial test, the T Count 
value is greater than T Table (5.799>1.649) with a significance value of 0.000 <0.05 that mean significant. The 
results of this study are in line with previous researched by Wicaksono & Seminari (2016) with the title ""The Effect 
of Advertising and Word of Mouth on traveling is prlatform Brand Awareness"" the results of this study is word of 
mouth about traveling is platform having a positive and significant effect on traveling is platform brand awareness. 
 
It can be seen from Table 3 that the 5 factors are very good, then the classical assumption test by  heteroscedasticity 
test all shows that the data are normally distributed. Then Table 4 is a linearity test was carried out to find out the 
model used was correct or not and it was proven that the linearity test was met. Then, Multiple Regression Analysis 
was conducted with the aim of testing the factors that effects to brand awareness on the adoption of Facebook social 
media marketing and the 5 (five) factors proved to be influential and significant. To be more specific, simultaneous 
and partial tests were conducted on data related to 5 (five) factors that influence brand awareness, namely 
Entertainment, Interaction, Informativeness, Advertisement, and E-Word of Mouth. Simultaneous (Table 2) and 
partial test (Table 5) results show that the dimensions contained in social media marketing partially and 
simultaneously influence the brand awareness of MSME products. From the whole research in Table 6, it can be 
said that the factors that influence brand awareness on social media marketing using Facebook have an effect of 
69.8% which can be seen from the Coefficient of Determination Test. 
 
5. Conclusion and Further Research 
The results based on data collection, data processing, and data analysis that have been carried out, the authors can 
take conclusions that answer the formulation of the problem from this research, namely as follows: 
 
Of the 5 factors that influence brand awareness, all of them have been shown to have a significant influences on 
Facebook social media marketing as a communication medium for MSME products. With the greatest value found 
in the social media marketing variable, namely the e-word of mouth dimension and the brand awareness variable 
contained in the Top of Mind dimension With the proven factors that influence to brand awareness on the adoption 
of social media marketing using Facebook as a communication media on products that are influential and 
significant, it has answered the research question of what factors influence and most influence brand awareness on 
adoption social media marketing using Facebook. It is hoped that further research can be carried out using a 
different scope in order to provide different research results so that further researchers can expand the object of 
research or conduct research on other MSMs.

Abstract 
Fulfilling the demands of industry 4.0, teachers are required to improve the quality of their profession. A quality 
profession will not be achieved if the teacher does not have a qualified and prosperous person. By utilizing 
technological developments, teachers can monitor and diagnose self-wellbeing conditions on an ongoing basis. The 
encounter of educational science, this psychological trait with Artificial Intelligence, is called Positive Education. One 
form of it is self-diagnostic that can diagnose psychological conditions to produce optimal quality. Teacher wellbeing 
can be defined as a condition of teacher emotional and cognitive evaluation of their life, which is related to happiness, 
peace, fulfilment, and life satisfaction. This study aims to develop a research instrument, namely teacher wellbeing 
that optimizes the quality of teacher's work life for face recognition-based applications. The research method used is 
the Neuroresearch method to instrument calibration. The result of the research is an evaluation of teacher wellbeing 
instrument that optimizes the quality of teacher's work life for face recognition-based applications. Teacher wellbeing 
can be defined as a condition of teacher emotional and cognitive evaluation of their life, which is related to happiness, 
peace, fulfilment, and life satisfaction. So that the teacher wellbeing instrument is built by three dimensions, namely 
cognitive, emotional and behaviour. This study contributes to the literature on facial recognition applications, 
especially regarding teacher wellbeing

Abstract 
Tapel Saga is a game that was developed by processing the Malangan mask visual, which is a work of Indonesian 
culture in the Malang area, East Java. This game gives a message about heroism, solidarity, community involvement 
and friendship so that it is hoped that through the Tapel Saga game, teenagers experience a real projection and are 
helped in responding to mental problems in their daily lives. This study aims to maximize the quality of the game by 
evaluating the usability of the game's user interface using the heuristics method. The research method was carried out 
using Neuroresearch which focused on the exploratory stage. In the exploratory research stage, the heuristic evaluation 
of the Tapel Saga game was carried out using a focus group discussion system so that there was an in-depth discussion 
between resource persons and game developers to find input and evaluate the ten criteria of the heuristic evaluation. 
The results showed that out of the ten criteria, 1 had been completed, while the others were minor fixes and still needed 
development. The results of the heuristic evaluation help evaluate the usability of the game interface so that it is of 
higher quality. Heuristic evaluation helps highlight potential usability issues early in game development.

Game improvements based on heuristic evaluations also keep in mind the original problem elements of the game itself. 
Because there is one limitation in heuristic evaluation is when there is a false alarm from the evaluation process itself. 
Therefore, in each subsequent development stage, continuous evaluation will be carried out so that the game can 
provide maximum results and quality and achieve game goals as set. 
 
5. Discussion 
Game Tapel Saga is a game where players will use and collect Malangan masks to fight enemies. The story in the 
game tries to indirectly encourage players to become better people through character development. As well as growing 
interest and pride in the masks of the archipelago, especially Malangan. 
 
Tapel Saga appears in the form of a side scrolling 2D RPG, the story is conveyed through conversation using pictures 
of characters and text boxes. The game mechanism is in the form of idle or clicker where the game progress will run 
automatically, the characters in the game attack the enemy automatically. But players also need to attack by choosing 
attacks or moves, leveling up, strengthening equipment, and more. 
 
The visual style uses an anime approach that is popular with the target audience but still has a distinctive face shape. 
The character's clothing is carefully considered, especially the main character who represents the symbol of the Panji 
figure. 
 
The User Interface (UI) will use a flat design style that matches the visual style of the character and is indeed in 
accordance with design trends, simple and easy to understand, namely: (a) Collecting data about the Malangan mask 
and the message of goodness to be conveyed, (b) Building the structure of the inner world. the game, (c) Designing 
the characters and assets needed, and (d) Designing the game system. 
 
With the heuristic evaluation, the usability evaluation of the game interface will help improve the quality of the game 
(Mendes et al. 2016; Tondello et al. 2016). Heuristic evaluations can help highlight potential usability issues early in 
game development (Parsapour et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2018). In addition, this method is the most practical and efficient 
method before involving players directly so that various errors can be anticipated that may arise.

Abstract 
The current study examines the efficiency changes of Nifty Pharma firms before and during the Covid-19 
pandemic. The sample has 17 selected pharmaceutical firms that represent a large fraction of pharmaceutical 
sector in India. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) the study reports an increase in overall efficiency in the 
years 2020 and 2021. Further, the improvement in scale of operations was reported among the sample of firms. 
Pre-pandemic surge in the number of production (pure) efficient firms subsided by the end of 2021, marking 
negative impact of Covid-19 on the allocation of inputs by pharmaceutical firms. It was found that production 
efficiency positively correlates with firm size and negatively with age. We recommend that inefficient companies 
optimize their scale efficiency through mergers and acquisitions, organic growth, restructuring, or outsourcing. 
Production efficiency can be achieved by minimizing salaries, wages, and bonuses, which presents a sensitive 
issue for managers to devise salary-cutting policies. Lastly, the study reports changing nature of reference 
companies, thus highlighting the importance of regular efficiency benchmarking.

1. Introduction
India is the largest producer of generic drugs in the world. During the testing times of Covid-19 pandemic, the 
demand for low-cost affordable medicines was arguably at its peak. It was a challenge for the Indian 
pharmaceutical firms to keep producing at the growing rate to fulfil the world’s demand for medicines. Further, 
the lockdown restrictions and growing covid cases among the labor force were major disruptions to keeping 
productivity up to demand. Another obstacle to the production was dependence of Indian pharmaceutical firms 
on Chinese drug makers for procuring active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) due to complete lockdown in China 
(Chatterjee 2020). However, it also opened avenues for Indian pharmaceutical industry to appear as a global leader 
in production of APIs but not without improving their supply chain (Ghosh et al., 2020). Discussing the above 
challenges, the current study aims to evaluate the efficiencies of Indian pharmaceuticals before and during Covid-
19 times using the sample of firms listed on Nifty pharmaceutical index. The current literature has studies citing 
the shortfall of medicines during Covid-19 (Fox et al., 2020). Mittal and Sharma (2021) reported positive impact 
of Covid-19 pandemic on the stock returns of the pharma companies. Few studies discuss the supply chain and 
logistics issues in the pharmaceutical industry in India (Mishra, 2012). However, to the best of our knowledge, 
the present study is the first one to evaluate the trends of production efficiencies. The findings will explain the 
productivity response of Indian pharmaceutical firms to the growing demand and other Covid-19 challenges such 
as regulations, labor, and raw material shortage. It will also explain the efficiency changes with respect to firm 
age, fixed assets, raw materials, and salaries and wages of employees. The rest of the paper is followed by a 
literature review in section 2. Methodology and results are provided in sections 3 and 4, respectively. The article 
concludes in section 5 along with the limitations of the study. 
2. Literature review
Covid-19 pandemic has created multiple challenges to the productivity of firms. The pharmaceutical industry was 
at the prime focus to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. Indian pharmaceutical firms were the suppliers to the world 
to keep the requirement of medicines. India pharmaceutical industry responded positively to the growing demands 
in preventive and curative drugs segments along with face masks (Ahmed et al. 2020). The study also reported 
incentives from “Make in India” initiative to boost production in India. India emerged as the major vaccine and 
drug manufacturer in the world (Kaur et al. 2021). Aravind and Manojkrishnan (2020) reported that 
pharmaceutical firms had momentum against falling market trend. This means that majority of pharmaceutical 
firms were reporting growth in the Covid-19 pandemic period. Joshi et al. (2020) also emphasised the

returns to scale) at a faster pace compared to input optimization. The dynamic nature of a business environment 
coupled with pandemic shock alters benchmarks and references for input optimization. Analysis has shown that 
greater production efficiency is positively associated with firm size and negatively with age. However, further 
improvement of production efficiency seems challenging as it involves compensation of employees. 
Notwithstanding the progress made by the firms, 7 companies from Nifty Pharma list need to improve production 
efficiency and 8 require certain scale adjustment.  
 
Negative shock presented by Covid-19 pandemic has proven the agility of pharmaceutical business in India. On 
the other side the resilience could be created by the speculative demand, which triggered companies to increase 
output. It is to be examined further whether these firms will be able to keep the level of efficiency or opportunities 
presented by pandemic will vanish over time. The study can be elaborated by exploring the relationship between 
efficiency and stock prices of the above-mentioned companies.

Abstract 
This study tries to explore the previous literature retrieved from Scopus databases regarding the factors that affect the 
adoption of digital payments. We screen the papers following PRISMA method. Following a systematic literature 
review method, a final sample of 64 research articles was identified and analyzed. The publication year of the articles 
are ranging from 2014 to 2022. The method that is most widely used is a quantitative method with the method of 
collecting data using a survey or questionnaire. We use NVIVO 12 Plus to analyze the data. The most widely used 
theories in adopting digital payments are TAM and UTAUT. Security is the most often factor that is used in digital 
payment adoption. Digital payments have merits as well as drawbacks, but still, the benefits are outnumbering the 
barriers.  Digital payments provide convenience to all generations from younger users like gen z and millennials to 
older generations including x generations and baby boomers. Future research can focus on the security of digital 
payments and consider the impact of technological advances on adopting digital payment. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Digital payments are flourishing in our developing world, and they can support financial inclusion (Ligon et al. 2019). 
Financial inclusion can be defined as the proportion of people who can access financial services (Naumenkova, 
Mishchenko, and Dorofeiev 2019; Lutfi et al. 2021). Financial inclusion can enhance financial stability, develop the 
economy, reduce unemployment rates, enhance financial access, reduce financial illicit activities and decrease the 
poverty level (Lutfi et al. 2021). Digital payment has significantly changed customers’ behaviors (Jiaxin Zhang, 
Luximon, and Song 2019). Forms of digital payments can be varied from mobile banking, debit/credit cards, e-wallets, 
internet banking, ATMs, QR code, Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), Near-Field-Communication (NFC), PoS, 
and other online payment applications. (Simatele and Mbedzi 2021; Das and Mahapatra 2019; Chaveesuk, Khalid, 
and Chaiyasoonthorn 2021a; Johari et al. 2021; Khan 2021; Omarini 2018). However, the adoption rate of digital 
payments in some countries remains low, although the government has already promoted it  (Ligon et al. 2019; 
Chaveesuk, Khalid, and Chaiyasoonthorn 2021a; Lutfi et al. 2021). Government plays important role in digital 
payments adoption, on the one hand, the government can support by giving numerous digital initiatives (Saxena and 
Joshi 2019), but on the other hand government policies can be a barrier to adopting digital payment, including taxes 
on digital payment, high agency fees, and structural rigidities (Seethamraju and Diatha 2018; Simatele and Mbedzi 
2021).  
Digital payments can provide benefits for companies and customers vis-à-vis flexibility, efficiency, mobility, and 
convenience (Sahi et al. 2021; Chaveesuk, Khalid, and Chaiyasoonthorn 2021a), but security becomes an important 
thing in adopting digital payments. Risk and cost were important inhibitors in adopting digital payments (Ligon et al. 
2019; Lutfi et al. 2021; Seethamraju and Diatha 2018).  
1.1 Objectives  
The objective of this research is to explore the factors that affect the adoption of digital payments.

1. Introduction
In recent upcoming years, electrical battery technology is improving day by day and it provides solutions for 
extending the range of Electric Vehicles. A cell has energy in the electrochemical form, which is then released to do 
work. The Battery Management System (BMS) monitors parameters like current, voltage, and thermal values and 
also it provides over-current, over-charge, short circuit protection, over-discharge, and functionalities. It gives data 
regarding vehicle range estimation, data recording, and communications through various communication protocols 
like SPI, I2C, and CAN.  BMS decides how much charge remains in the battery pack that is State-of-Charge (SOC), 
monitors the health of the battery pack is nothing but State-of-Health (SOH) so that provide prolonged state-of -Life 
(SOL) to the cells and battery pack. Due to the continuous charge-discharge operations voltages among the serially 
connected battery cell get imbalanced nothing but SOC imbalance. BMS contains the algorithm for the precise 
estimation of SOH & SOC. Also cares for no cell inside the battery pack going out of the limit of the given operated 
Safe-Operating-Area (SOA). Li-ion batteries are used widely because of their low weight, high charge density and 
high-performance characteristics. A typical Li-ion battery has the lowest voltage of 2.7V, an operating voltage of 
3.7V and a voltage high of 4.2V. Battery cells lead to unstable conditions if they charge to their extreme limits

Abstract 
This article deals with the design and development of the modified rotary particle depositor and its characteristics. 
This modified rotary particle depositor combines the design advantages of Direct Reading Ferrography and Analytical 
Ferrography, also it is versatile in its application over a range of wear particles. The effect of the rotation speed of the 
magnet holder, the flow rate of the oil sample, the concentration of particles, and the thickness of the glass plate are 
investigated. The speed of the magnet holder is controlled using an ‘Arduino UNO’ microcontroller and the flow of 
sample oil is controlled using micro pumps operated by an ‘Arduino UNO’ microcontroller. The oil sample used in a 
motorcycle or any gearbox is observed using an optical microscope. In the experimental setup, one strong permanent 
disc-shaped magnet is used. It has been observed that most of the wear particles in an oil sample were deposited 
around the outer diameter of the magnet where maximum magnetic flux field gradient is localized. A simple theory 
for the automation of the rotary particle depositor is presented with an experimental setup.

Abstract 
Friction Drilling is a Chip less hole-making process in which a conical tool is used to form the hole on the sheet 
metal by frictional heating. Metal flows plastically in both upward and downward directions. The extruded metal 
on top is converted into the boss with the help of the shoulder of the tool while downward extruded material is well 
controlled to form the bush. A formed bush can be threaded and used to screw other connecting parts. The process 
is suitable for sheet metal having a thickness of less than 5 mm and finding applications in Automobiles, Furniture, 
etc. Thrust force and Torque are two Important parameters which affect the frictional heating during hole formation 
and thereafter tool wear and hole quality. In this work, experimentation on low carbon steel, AISI 1018 has been 
carried out at the Vertical Machining Center. For real-time Data Acquisition of Thrust Force and Torque, Kistler 
Dynamometer equipped with DynoWare software is used. The Thrust force and Torque prediction model for 
friction drilling of AISI 1018 steel has been developed using Random Forest (RF) and Regularization Methods 
(RM). Ridge and Lasso Regression which are important tools in RM have been utilized to model the measured data 
for Thrust force and Torque. GridSearch(GS) technique has been used for tuning hyperparameters. The Random 
Forest (RF) gives a reliable prediction of thrust force with 𝑅𝑅2= 0.97, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 71.91 N, Root 
Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 96 N on training data and 𝑅𝑅2 = 0.92, MAE =140 N, RMSE = 96 N on test data. 
Similarly, Torque Prediction Random Forest (RF) gives better predictions than RM on Test Data with 𝑅𝑅2 = 0.93, 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 0.22 Nm, and RMSE = 0.29 Nm but on Training data Performance is almost similar 
both the methods. Comparisons among RF, Ridge, and Lasso regression show that RF is an effective technique to 
ensure high predictive accuracy of Thrust Force and Torque.

1. Introduction
Improvement in the product quality at a minimum cost has been primary motive of all the manufacturing industries. 
Analyzing the quality problems and there after carrying out corrective actions is cumbersome and time-consuming 
approach. This also hides many quality problems and exaggerates the production cost.  Real time data acquisition or 
online monitoring of manufacturing process is proposed an effective way to analyze the quality problems efficiently. 
In this work real time investigations have been carried out on Friction Drilling Process.  Basically, friction or thermal 
drilling process is employed for sheet metal appliances of different sections viz. Tubular, Rectangular, I etc. having 
thickness up to 5 mm. Friction drilling tool which has typical geometry and different sections viz. Center, Conical 
Cylindrical, Shoulder and shank for holding purpose (Pantawane 2011). In this process high speed rotating tool 
approaches the workpiece which generates frictional heat (500°-900°) and causes the material to flow plastically 
(Alphonse et al. 2021). The Extruded material above the workpiece is rounded off as Boss by bottom face of shoulder. 
The downward extruded material is controlled and made into cylindrical shaped with the cylindrical section of friction 
drilling tool which forms the bush. The Bush thus formed can be threaded in consecutive thread forming process to 
make the threaded hole. The length of bush is generally three times the material of thickness and offers good clamping

𝑅𝑅2 in case of RF is around 0.97 on training dataset and 0.92 on test dataset. MAE and RMSE values in case of Random 
Forest for training data is 71.91 N and 96 N and for test dataset values are 140 N and 171.26 N respectively. In case 
of Ridge and Lasso Regression value of 𝑅𝑅2 is 0.93 and 0.92 respectively on training data. On test dataset 𝑅𝑅2  value 
for both techniques are around 0.91 and 0.88 respectively.

Similarly, Table 7 shows statistical performance of all three models in terms of Mean squared error (MSE), Root mean 
squared error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (𝑅𝑅2) for Torque prediction. In Torque prediction also Random 
Forest performs better than Regularization methods. RF gives 𝑅𝑅2 value around 0.94 on training data and 0.93 on Test 
data. MAE and RMSE values in case of Random Forest for training data is 0.28 Nm and 0.37 Nm and for test dataset 
values are 0.22 Nm and 0.29 Nm respectively.

7. Conclusion  
The Modeling and prediction of response parameters of any machining process positively impact production in terms 
of reduction in cost and resources.  
1. The result clearly shows that Random Forest algorithm performed much better than Regularization method 
and it gives MAE between Actual and predicted Thrust Force 140 N on test data. 
2. Both regularization techniques Ridge and Lasso Regression gives nearly same prediction in terms of 𝑅𝑅2 
which is 0.91 and 0.88 on test data respectively. 
3. Random Forest gives better results in case of Torque Prediction and both the Regularization techniques gives 
nearly same results in case of Thrust force and Torque Predictions. 
4. For dealing with Underfitting and Overfitting hyperparameters of all three models were tuned with the help 
of GridSearch (GS) technique from that we get optimum values of Hyperparameters. In case of RF 
max_depth = 5, max_features =2 and n_estimators =10 these are the optimum values of hyperparameters. 
Optimum values of hyperparameter in case of Ridge and Lasso Regression are 𝛼𝛼 = 0.1 and  𝛼𝛼 = 1 
respectively. 
The result shows that the RF could be utilized by process operators to predict thrust force parameters prior to the actual 
production process in order to save the cost of material and resources.

Abstract 
Increments in vehicle emission and demand for fossil fuels, making vehicle manufacturers around the world to look 
forward into alternative ways in introducing new electric vehicle model that would vastly capture the market. Best 
strategy of OEM now is to make competitive edge in the market and satisfy customer demands on the basis of range 
and pricing of the vehicle. Various EV part manufacturers producing the parts at different specification and price level. 
Where OEMs are trying to tune up vehicle at highly efficient performance (in the sense of range) and at lower pricing. 
EV’s are facing challenges in mileage issue. Range of the EV is mainly depending on the performance of electric drive 
systems such as battery, traction motor, controller and gearbox. For EV OEMs it is most important task to select best 
substitute parts amongst various alternatives for their EV to improve efficiency of  the vehicle. This study focuses on 
improving the efficiency of the EV by selecting efficient battery amongst various alternatives and attributes with the 
help of decision making and optimization techniques. The procedure is divided in 3 parts. First is data collection of 
battery alternatives available in market and their attributes, second is to use of hybrid MCDM Ahp-Topsis technique 
and finally validate them by cross checking against actual vehicle level testing of the part. We have selected efficient 
battery with the help of Ahp and Topsis methods amongst six alternatives and four attributes of the batteries.

1. Introduction
The development of electric vehicles has been chosen as the strategy for the solution of rising air pollution and the 
energy consumption all over the world. electrical vehicles initiative (EVI) is the multi administration policy which is 
totally focused on accelerating the implementation of the EV all over the world. Electric vehicle is widely considered 
as air pollution eliminator and way towards sustainable environment goals. 
EV sector is new for world as well as for manufactures too. Many new companies are trying their lucks in the EV. 
The competition among the EV manufacturing industries has increased rapidly. This development has bought some 
problems and some requirements with itself. Everyone is struggling in the EV manufacturers as well as customers 
too. Many problems are coming in the vehicles. Like range issues and performance issues. Customers are in critical 
state of mind whether to replace the traditional IC engine vehicle to EV as like in traditional vehicles we can fill fuel 
on petrol pumps. And we have petrol pumps in 500 m to 1km range. Where EV have that problem that we can’t charge 
batteries in minutes like filling petrol in few minutes and start the vehicle. 
Testing of the system with required efficient parts on the vehicle with too many alternatives cannot be experimented. 
This is long process and time consuming also. And this is too expensive and impractical to do in system. This study 
focuses on the problems of the OEMs about vehicle range. This study will help the EV manufacturers to select the 
best battery for their vehicles amongst too many choices of batteries, where numerous battery manufacturers are

After calculation of separation measures (Table 10) and  rankings were given to the alternatives from the Pi values in 
descending orders as shown in. Table 11. Battery 4 was best according to the ranking order preferences and Battery 5 
was the last choice by this method. This can be understood by the graphical results as shown in Figure 5. 
 
 
Figure 5. Graphical Results 
 
5.4 Validation 
After approaching with hybrid method, experiment validated with vehicle level testing to check whether part conforms 
the efficiency increment. As the efficiency of the EV  mainly depend on the power consumption per km, decrease in 
the power consumption per km would be beneficial for the performance improvement of the vehicle. All six batteries 
are checked on the vehicle. Range test were conducted on six alternatives separately. The vehicle whr/km for battery 
4 was 51.20 whr/km. as shown in the Table.11 and for battery 5 it was 55.96 whr/ km . It was clear that best choice 
made by the hybrid Ahp-Topsis was correct and acceptable. And worst choice made by analytical method was also 
correct as shown in the table. Battery 5 whr/km was higher i.e. 55.96 whr/km.

technique is that their capability of addressing the problems which are inconsistent in data with numerous alternatives 
and attributes in easiest way. The results got are correct and acceptable as it gives same choice if done by traditional 
testing of each part separately. This method tells most best and worst choices, so non beneficial parts can be avoided 
for taking into consideration. Evaluation process is a multi-staged decision-making problem but if apply the mcdm 
technique then most of the time can be save. For EV OEMs it is more important to save development time and use 
time saving techniques where there is lot of competition in market. This method can be used anywhere in business 
strategy making to take critical decisions.

Abstract 
There are many project management methodologies which can be selected while starting new projects. The purpose 
of this paper is to compare most popular methodology Agile and Waterfall. This paper will determine which is the 
most suitable for a website development project. Every project is different and requires to be handled differently. 
Hence, it is better not to grip on one particular methodology. conclude that there is no best methodology when it comes 
to select the methodology for a website project, a numerous factor needs to be accounted while choosing methodology 
to go with. Waterfall will be a better solution for small projects that have well-defined requirements that will not 
change, while Agile is preferred when continuous delivery and feedback are important.

1. Introduction
IT project management methodologies can be traditional and agile, and the choice of some of them depends on the 
nature and characteristics of the project tasks. Agile project management methods have been used for several years. 
Customer needs, project risk, project size, cost, and project complexity must be considered when deciding which 
project management method to use(Raj and Sinha, 2020). The paper compares traditional and agile approaches based 
on scientific literature and data and concludes which methodology is suitable for web development tasks (Thesing et 
al., 2021). 
The waterfall model is the division of project activities into parallel successive phases, where each phase depends on 
the results of the previous one and corresponds to the specialization of tasks(Journal and Chandrika, 2021). Agile 
methodology is a practice that encourages continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the 
software/web development life cycle of a project. In the Agile model, unlike the Waterfall methodology, development 
and testing activities take place in parallel (Rather and Bhatnagar, 2015). 
1.1 Objectives 
The purpose of this paper is to compare the most popular methodology - Agile and Waterfall. In IT projects agile 
methods are better choice than traditional methods this paper will suggest which method is best suitable for your 
website development project with help of real case studies. 
2.Literature Review
Waterfall methodology is a sequential design process and is used in website development. This methodology shows a 
process that flows smoothly, exactly like a waterfall, through all phases of a project, such as conception, initiation,

Figure 6. Comparison of Waterfall vs Scrum 
 
According to statistics presented in the annual State of Agile report developed by Digital.ai, highlighted scrum as the 
most popular agile approach with 66% software projects done with this methodology (Digital.ai The 15 th Annual 
State of Agile Report 2021). As shown in Figure 7. However, this statistic should not influence the decision-making 
of project managers in choosing the appropriate implementation method  
 
The Scrum methodology is a subset of the Agile methodology and the most popular process framework that 
implements Agile. Scrum is a method that works great for complex and innovative projects and brings solutions with 
a focus on project management(Sharma and Hasteer, 2017).

5. Conclusion  
It can be concluded that Agile and Waterfall methodology has its own strengths and weaknesses. As such, there is no 
solution for all types of website development projects. Various factors like the Client Requirements, number of people 
in the team, project completion timeline, how inclined to changes the requirements are or the duration of the project 
should be considered. Therefore, it was observed that most projects that used Waterfall are small projects, having 
teams of less people and in the results of the study, the most popular methodology is Agile, using Scrum. In conclusion,

the methodology chosen depends on each team and must be picked specifically for that project tasks, as no approach 
can satisfy all needs. The tendency is that Waterfall methodology is used mostly in small projects tasks that have well 
defined requirements, while Agile methodology is more flexible and preferred when continuous feedback is important.

Abstract 
Attention to the importance of indoor air quality (IAQ) has increased in recent years. It is a topic that has grabbed the 
interest of scholars, researchers, and the public. Unfortunately, research shows that many indoor locations such as 
houses, nurseries, schools and offices have been suffering from unhealthy indoor air. Current literature shows that the 
most significant indoor air contaminants are CO2, CO, NO2, O3, TVOCs, and particular matter along with thermal 
conditions such as temperature and humidity. The presence of those contaminants affects human health negatively. 
While different methods to improve indoor air do exist today, yet there is no one best solution. Green Lean Six Sigma 
(GLSS) frameworks has been used successfully to tackle the problems related to environmental issues in different 
fields. Accordingly, this paper tries to address a core question of the possibility of applying GLSS approach to improve 
indoor air quality within various facilities. The definition of GLSS and an overview of the developed GLSS 
frameworks and their applications will be presented through a review of the relevant articles available in the literature. 
The findings will highlight possible challenges and featured strong promising research opportunities regarding the use 
of GLSS approach to improve indoor air quality. The major finding is that there is a lack of implementation of GLSS 
in different fields and exploring new fields will most probably show positive feedback.

1. Introduction
Clean air is an essential requirement to life and vital for people’s well-being. For that reason, the quality of the air is 
a major concern to many researchers. Research indicate that  91% of the world’s population live in places where air 
quality levels exceed World Health Organization limits,  although it has  been proven that individuals in developed 
countries spend almost 90% of their time indoor (World Health Organization (WHO) 2014) (Beig et al. 2019). Air 
quality is one of the pillars of indoor environment, which is one of the top five environmental risks to public health 
(Asere and Blumberga 2020). Thus, it is said that ensuring a good quality indoor air works on reducing the health 
problems that children and adults may face throughout the years. 
In general, clean air is measured by how far the air is free from harmful pollutants. The balance between indoor air 
pollutants and outdoor air pollutants is a matter of building tightness, construction materials, road traffic, cooking 
appliance, lifestyle habits, and personal activities of the occupants (Funk et al. 2014). Indoor air includes particles that 
penetrates from outdoor air, along with particles that results from occupants’ behaviors such as indoor activities 
including cleaning, cooling etc. (Khaki et al. 2020). Indoor air can be categorized into physical properties, chemical 
properties and adverse health effects (Khaki et al. 2020). Chemical properties include pollutants such as Carbon 
Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Formaldehyde, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Total Volatile Organic 
Compounds (TVOC), Airborne Particulate Matters Smaller than 2.5 µm in Diameter Suspended in the Air (PM2.5), 
Airborne Particulate Matters with a diameter less than 10 μm (PM10), dust and some other industrial or agriculture 
pollutants (Schütze et al. 2020) (Khaki et al. 2020). Those pollutants are considered frequent pollutants that are 
contributing to weakening the indoor air quality (Jones 2017). Moreover, physical properties include particle and 
fibers such as asbestos (Khaki et al., 2020). In addition to, humidity and temperature (Van Tran et al. 2020). Finally, 
examples of adverse health effects include eye irritation.

Abstract 
The e-commerce industry is expanding rapidly. All offline operations are affected by the pandemic, and the majority 
of enterprises relocate online. To reach clients on a broad scale from their D2C website, today's businesses must opt 
for an online store. Industries of all sizes are working hard to expand their businesses. However, simply launching a 
direct-to-consumer e-commerce website won't help them expand their firm quickly. They will be able to quickly scale 
up their firm with the aid of strategic marketing. The majority of people in today's society utilize social media, spend 
a lot of time online, and share their interests. The most effective method for audience targeting is social media. The 
potential for higher results through the use of digital marketing. Both large and small businesses now have an 
advantage over their rivals in the market in terms of sales thanks to the development of digital marketing. However, 
because there are so many competing aims and so many diverse criteria, evaluating digital marketing technologies is 
quite difficult. Marketing strategies are subject to a wide range of criteria. Project managers face lots of issues while 
selecting the right marketing tool and selecting the right marketing strategies and optimizing the campaign. This 
problem can be solved using a multi-criteria decision-making method. Making the best choice in multi-criteria 
problems will be aided by it. In order to provide marketers with the best marketing strategies for their particular 
companies, this study will represent the challenge of choosing marketing strategies as an MCDM problem. This paper 
presents the analysis of different criteria having an impact on digital marketing campaign performance for the e-
commerce industry using the AHP & TOPSIS method.  So, to overcome this problem, we rank the different criteria 
with their impact on digital marketing performance.

Abstract 
In the face of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, declared in Peruvian territory as of March 2019, many of the jobs were 
forced to drastically change their way of working, opting for teleworking in order to continue their operations. Remote 
work had a strong impact on the work conditions of Peruvian workers, increasing stress due to the modification of 
work schedules and in some cases even increasing working hours, due to the limited sample and the emerging 
characteristic of psychosocial risk assessment, there is not much information about the impact of this work modality 
on the quality of life of the workers who experience it. The methodology used was a systematic review of the literature 
related to teleworking. Most of the articles used are from important databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. 
A total of 52 articles were obtained and used to write this article. For the analysis of the information, the data obtained 
were categorized into factors and dimensions. 
Key Words 
Teleworking, psychosocial risks, safety and health at work. 
1. Introduction
The pandemic has caused a sudden increase in workload, as well as major changes in working arrangements and 
conditions, such as telecommuting. Many organizations where telecommuting was virtually non-existent moved 
overnight to an unknown work system (Eurasia Review, 2020). This study focuses on the analysis of the psychosocial

6. Conclusion 
This systematic review investigated recent information related to teleworking regarding psychosocial risks in the 
context of Covid-19. In general, there were few studies that addressed the specific study of psychosocial risks under 
this modality. On the other hand, the results used for this article showed that the following variables are significant 
according to the perception of the population studied: work pace, pandemic uncertainty, double presence, development 
possibilities, emotional demands and the requirement to hide emotions. These findings will help employers identify 
points to improve in the organization for a better work environment.

Abstract 
This paper examines how Indonesia challenge the issue of energy availability to support Indonesian manufacturing. 
Considering the number of manufacturing industries in Indonesia, the country requires a significant amount of 
energy. The total energy supply owned by Indonesia cannot fulfill the demand of manufacturing because several 
other supporting sectors require energy supplies as well. This study uses qualitative and secondary data taken from 
various literatures relevant to this topic. In addition, the author also uses the theory of economic diplomacy to 
analyze the problem of energy availability for manufacturing with the aim of Indonesia’s economic growth.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a diverse archipelago nation with the largest economy in Southeast Asia. Indonesia has experienced 
rapid growth since emerging from the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Indonesia already has the world's 10th 
largest economy by purchasing power parity (World Bank 2021b). Indonesia has made major progress in poverty 
reduction since 1999, with the poverty rate declined by more than half to 9.78 % in 2020 (Embassy of the Republic 
of Indonesia in London n.d.). Indonesia has recently qualified for middle to upper-income status by providing 
constant economic (World Bank 2021b). 
The economic planning in Indonesia is based on a 20-year development plan that runs from 2005 to 2025. It is 
divided into National Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 5-year medium-term plans, each with its own set 
of development priorities (Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in London n.d.). The spread of COVID-19 has 
made renewed Indonesia a partnership with World Bank Group for the period of 2021-2025. The Framework would 
be aimed to assist Indonesia in its recovery from the pandemic to sustained economic growth and significant 
reductions in poverty. The existence of this Country Cooperation Framework (CFP) with the assistance of the World 
Bank Group can assist Indonesia in achieving its ambition to become a high-income class (World Bank 2021a). This 
is evidenced by an increase in Indonesia’s economic growth between 4.5% and 5.5% this year, following a 2.1% 
contraction in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Tani 2018). 
The manufacturing sector has an important role in economic activity, especially in Indonesia (GlobalData 2021). 
Based on the 2016 International Yearbook of Industrial Statistics, Indonesia is included in the top ten largest 
manufacturing industrial countries in the world, surpassing the UK, Russia, and Canada. So that the manufacturing 
industry needs Indonesia to be able to encourage the country's economic growth, employment, increase exports and 
increase investment (Pratiwi and Aida 2017).  
In 2020, it is known that there are 30,381 manufacturing companies in Indonesia (BPS-Statistics 2020). The 
manufacturing sector in Indonesia is in dire need of fuel derived from oil and gas commodities (Prastiyo 2020). With 
increased activity in the manufacturing industry, an increase in the energy supply is needed to balance the needs of 
the manufacturing industry. With a wide range of potential benefits, the energy supply can help the manufacturing 
industry develop and significantly contributes to state revenues. However, Indonesia's current energy supply is

Source: Data based on the author’s analysis of energy availability and economic growth in Indonesia 
 
Based on the Figure 3, the availability of energy has an impact on economic growth. In 2018, the availability of 
energy fell, and in 2019 it rose again. Indonesia’s economic growth conditions in 2018-2019 were stable at 5%. A 
significant impact can be seen in 2020 where energy availability declines, economic growth also drops sharply. 
Indonesia’s economic growth conditions increase again in 2021 in line with the increase in energy availability. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The manufacturing industry in Indonesia is needed from the existence of an energy supply. The adequate energy 
supply can help the manufacturing sector in fulfill its needs so that it can move well. Based on the theory, there are 
four points discussed among others, trade, investment, industrial cooperation, and labor. First, in the trade, there is a 
role of China as an income contributor in the Asian region that requires Indonesia's energy supply to fulfill its needs. 
Second, in the investment, Indonesian foreign investments can help in encouraging productivity, Indonesia can be 
further developed and have more advanced technology in manufacturing. Three, Indonesia cooperates with the 
United States in maintaining energy availability and developing technology and knowledge. Four, the existence of 
this manufacturing can also help Indonesia in providing even greater employment opportunities in the country. With 
the opportunity of employment, it can reduce the unemployment rate in the country. Finally, the reduced 
unemployment rate can also have an impact on the country of Indonesia because it will be able to have an impact on 
increasing economic growth.

Abstract 
Disaster management is considered global jeopardies toward humankind toward their sustainable development goals. 
Technology driven for this disaster management plays vital role in responding and recovering disaster management 
within mitigated risk. The technology refers to Artificial Intelligence Technology for disaster preparedness, response 
and recovery. Indonesia and Japan Disaster Management is chosen as comparative analysis due to its similarities and 
differences between two countries that are prone to disaster. In this paper, the Artificial Intelligence’s technology and 
method refer but not limited to method of Expert Systems (ES), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interface System (ANFIS). The objective of this paper 
is to generate comparative analysis between Indonesia and Japan Disaster Management. Eventually, this paper is 
intended to intertwine Artificial Intelligence with Disaster Management. The approaches to intertwine both aspects 
are conducted within Trilogy of Civil Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Business Engineering. As research 
methodology, this paper elaborates both theoretical and empirical perspectives, that commence with global perspective 
and eventually it shortlists into the comparative analysis between Indonesia and Japan Disaster Management. Within 
the Engineering Trilogy, to begin with, Civil Engineering toward disaster management considers wide spectrum of 
theoretical and empirical perspectives to augment disaster resilience. Furthermore, Industrial Engineering and to some 
extent the Industrial and System Engineering, synergize the disaster management within its supply chain and digital 
transformation’s information system as competitive advantage. Eventually, the Business Engineering wraps up both 
Civil Engineering and Industrial Engineering into integrated Business Strategies, through the Technology Driven 
including Artificial Intelligence.

There are significant scholar works throughout the year of 2005 until 2020 on both theoretical research and empirical 
research of disaster management (Sood and Rawat, 2021), as illustrated in Figure 1. It is interesting to observe the 
countries that are adequately productive to conduct research on disaster management. In the most productive ranks

Disaster management is considered global jeopardies toward humankind toward their sustainable development goals. 
Technology driven for this disaster management plays vital role in responding and recovering disaster management

Expert Systems (ES), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and 
Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Interface System (ANFIS). 
Indonesia and Japan Disaster Management is chosen as comparative analysis due to its similarities and differences 
between two countries that are prone to disaster. Precisely, this paper conveys comparative analysis from lens of 
disaster management regulations in both countries, including the similarities and differences. To begin with both 
countries are prone to disaster due to its geographical profiles as its similarities among other significant factors. 
Furthermore, in term of differences among other significant factors, there are the considerations of whether the disaster 
management coordination is overlapping or not, in each of the mentioned countries. 
Similar to Indonesia and Japan, then other countries have to consider subsequent series of disaster management as 
precautions in at least three stages of Natural Disaster Management, known as NDM. This NDM comprises 
precautions actions prior, during and posterior the occurrence of disaster. Those actions are meticulously categorized 
as disaster preparedness, disaster response and disaster recovery, according to several scholar works. Ultimately, it 
can further be improved for future research in both theoretical and empirical perspectives, not only in Indonesia and 
Japan, but also for the rest of countries worldwide.

Abstract 
In expressing sinusoidal waves mathematically with the addition of the amplitude parameters, the equation becomes 
x(n) = ΣAn sin 2πfnt. Signals in the form of sinusoidal waves can experience interference when getting frequency 
readings. This interference is caused by the presence of noise in the sinusoidal wave signal. In this study, the amplitude 
of sinusoidal signal and noise will be compared to determine how much noise affects frequency readings. The method 
adopted to transform discrete data x(n) into frequency is the Discrete Fourier Transform. Based on the results obtained, 
when the amplitude value in discrete data is greater than the noise value, frequency readings are defined and clear. 
Noise value double the value of the amplitude value can still yield frequency readings from a structure; however, 
results are barely comprehensible.   
Keywords 
Amplitude, noise, frequency, signal, sinusoidal waves. 
1. Introduction
The general expression of a sinusoidal wave involves frequency and time parameters. Expressed graphically, its 
equation will yield peak points. These peak points are also known as amplitude. By definition, the amplitude is the 
farthest distance or deviation from the equilibrium point in a sinusoidal wave. The amplitude does not affect the 
frequency value of the sinusoidal signal (Lai, 2003). In the form of a mathematical equation the equation of a 
sinusoidal wave with the addition of a parameter of amplitude, namely x(n) = An sin 2πfnt (Bolton, 2021; Muscas, 
2016).  
Signals in the form of sinusoidal waves can experience interference in reading frequency values. This is caused by 
noise in the sinusoidal wave signal (Ahmad, 1990). Noise is unwanted interference in an electrical signal 
(Motchenbacher, 1993). The noise produced by electronic devices varies greatly because it is produced by several 
different effects (Kapoor, 2017; Aburuotu, 2021). In communication systems, noise is an unwanted error or random 
interference of a useful signal. 
In a structural vibration test, reliability and accuracy of the collected signals is very important, as they are contaminated 
with noise. The noise embedded in the signal could put limits on detection of small defects by affecting the accuracy 
and reliability of the results (Yi, 2012). Noises causes the emergence of new amplitude points on a sinusoidal wave 
signal with a random pattern (Liu, 2012; Juarez-Salazar, 2017). In this study, it will be taken into account how much 
the noise value will affect the reading of the frequency value in the sinusoidal signal. The parameters that will be 
compared are the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal and the noise value given to the sinusoidal signal. 
2. Methods
The flow chart of the effect of the amplitude value of the sinusoidal signal on the frequency value is shown in Figure 
1. The values of the amplitude of the sinusoidal signal used as the base of this analysis are 1, 1/10, 1/100, and 1/1000.
In conducting a study of the effect of the sinusoidal signal amplitude on frequency, the frequency value, sample rate,
and standard deviation of the noise that has been determined are accounted for. The frequency value used consists of
the frequency value objectives, namely (fn) = 2 Hz, 3 Hz, 4 Hz, 5 Hz, 6 Hz, 7 Hz, and 8 Hz. The sample rate used is

The same result is also shown in discrete data with an amplitude of 0.01 with a noise of 0.03, 0.02 and 0.01. The noise 
content with twice the amplitude value can still read the frequency value from the structure. This result is proven by 
the graph obtained in Figure 10 in the following. For noise content that is more than 2 times the amplitude value of 
discrete data, it causes interference in reading the structure frequency value.

4. Conclusion 
After conducting this study, it can be concluded: 
• The amplitude value of 1 and the noise 0.5 can be concluded that the noise has not interfered with the reading of 
the value of the structure frequency 
• The amplitude value is 0.1 and the noise is 0.5, it can be concluded that the noise has interfered with the reading of 
the value of the structure frequency 
• The amplitude value of 0.01 and the noise of 0.5 can be concluded that the noise has interfered with the reading of 
the value of the structure frequency 
• Amplitude value in discrete data which is greater than the noise value gives clear frequency readings 
• Noise value with twice the amplitude value can still read the frequency value from the structure 
• The noise value is 2 times greater than the amplitude value, causing difficulty in determining the reading of the 
frequency value.

Abstract 
Business activities need excellent voice communication quality to avoid misunderstandings between the parties. 
Currently voice communications is embedded in data communication and related to Internet connections. End devices 
include IP based telephones set and the ubiquitous smartphones that are now Internet connected as well. Smartphones 
are cellular based, but technological evolution and customer demand leads to Internet data services. Internet enables 
the change of communications from voice centric to data centric communications. Traditional analog voice 
communication is superseded by digital technique that resulted in digital voice. Internet enables the ease of 
connectivity of digital data. As digital voice is now data, Voice over IP (VOIP) can be part of data service in Internet. 
Voice can now be embedded in Internet based services. Businesses currently do not need separate voice and data 
network. The acceptance of technology depends on the quality of service perceived by the customers. In voice 
communications ITU issued has recommendation for telephony quality known MOS (Mean Opinion Service). It is 
interesting to have a simple method to measure MOS of voice communications. The MOS should provide an indication 
if the service is acceptable or inadequate for business use. The MOS indicator will be useful for business entities 
especially small and medium enterprise that are operating from premises with only cellular network as their Internet 
access choice. The ITU recommendation provides detailed variables to measure the MOS. This research determines 
equipment impairment factor that affects R factor that determine MOS based on data obtained from measurements.

1. Introduction
TCP/IP based networks currently carrying digitized voice traffic. The digitized voice become the load of IP packets. 
As IP packets are carrying voice, the voice service is known as Voice over IP (VOIP). Internet it created to function 
as data network. Internet then evolved to carry whatever information that are digitized and packetized as IP packets. 
Real time voice in the meantime can be digitized and packetized as IP packets. Voice over IP (VOIP) emerge as 
solution converge voice communication network and data communication network. Unifying the two network 
increases the efficiency of business operations. Internet itself as data network was not developed to handle in real-
time information. Parameters that typically determine real time quality such as delay, packet loss and jitter are not of 
particular importance. There must be additional effort in order that these parameters can be controlled in order to 
provide the required quality of real time data. VoIP is one of real time application that are running on IP. It is important 
that voice communication should have certain acceptable quality for intelligible conversation. In voice 
communications the quality of intelligible is better known as Quality-of-Service (QOS). It largely depends on the 
infrastructure of the communication network. Before the proliferation of cellular network, the communication 
infrastructure is based on copper cable. Not only communication networks but also data network including Internet is 
copper based. The versatility of Internet demands higher transmission data transmission speed and naturally 
bandwidth. The demand is fulfilled by choosing optical cable. Copper and optical cable are known as fixed media and 
users depend on a fixed geographical location ta access the global Internet network. If there is no infrastructure is 
available to access the Internet, the network has is no global interconnection. It can only have intranet.

Figure 3 shows the graph of measurement result of g711 codec taken for one week. G711 codec provides good MOS 
for voice communications. It is understandable as G711 does not compress the digital voice, but it need a wide 
bandwidth which is normally 64 kbps. GSM codec the digital voice and need less bandwidth to 13 Kbps. 
 
5.1 Numerical Results 
The packet loss increases Ie and decreases MOS. The formula being used is (ITU-T 2004): 
Ief = L1 + L2 ln(1 + L3)          (3) 
According to the formula 
Ief = L1 + L2 ln(1 + L3e)          (4) 
Where the known values of L1, L2, L3 for codec G729a are L1=11, L2=40, and L3=10. For codec G711 its values are 
L1=0, L2=30, and L3=15. In in G.713 the estimated value are L2=25 and L3=14. The estimation for GSM is calculated 
based on its codec rate of 13 kbps with L2= 30, L3=15 for G.711 with codec rate of 64 kbps and L2 = 40, L3 = 10 for 
G.729a with codec rate of 8kbps. 
With codec rate difference of 56 kbps then the differences in L2 = -10 and L3 = 5. For that for 1 kbps difference in 
codec it is estimated that the rate change for L3 equal to (15-10)/56. L3 of GSM is then estimated to become 10 + (13-
5) (5/56) = 10.45 or L3 = 10. Meanwhile; the L2 change in codec rate per kbps is equal to (30-40)/56. L2 of GSM is 
estimated to 40 - 0.89 or 39.  Hence for GSM codec Ie can be simplified as [13]: 
Ie = 20 + 39 ln (1 + 10e)          (5) 
Estimated GSM Half Rate with C/I (carrier to interference) 10 dB has Ie range between 25 and 32, GSM Full Rate has 
Ief range between 32 and 39.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Simplified E-model gives R-factor that can be mapped to MOS. R-factor itself shows among other equipment 
impairment factor as a major contributor of the decrease of MOS. The equipment impairment factor depends on the 
codec being used. There are already results to account several types of codecs except GSM codec. In this research the 
GSM codec equipment factor is estimated in 3G/4G environment using smartphones. It would of interest if the 
equipment impairment factor need significant adjustments for simplified E-model.

Abstract 
As many universities in Jakarta do not have in campus dormitories, entrepreneurs regard dormitories as business 
opportunity. They renovate and sometimes build semi high rise building to cater the need of students of near-by 
universities. The dormitories are equipped with Internet infrastructure. The students can then subscribe the dormitory 
infrastructure. The onset of Covid-19 pandemic forced the dorm’s owner to improve their service quality. Social 
distancing, work from home and other movement limitation naturally increase network traffic. Dormitory residents 
started to complaint concerning Internet accessibility. Traffic management become a must in order to provide better 
service. This research provides a model of traffic management can be economically implemented either on premise or 
remotely. It is also based on conventional on premise network hardware that has the facility to manage traffic of small 
to medium scale business. To test the model, PRTG is used as the monitoring system and MikroTik routers that have 
several choices shape Internet are selected. Traffic can be shaped according to user need. Implementing the model 
enables proactive network management.

1. Introduction
Most higher education institutions such as universities in Jakarta do not have dormitories for their students. The 
students attending these higher education institution have their home town outside Jakarta. They are coming regions 
around Jakarta and all over Indonesia. The better universities attract potential students. They can be financially or 
intellectually better off. They will need accommodation during their study period. There are also students who are 
residents of Jakarta self but have to commute to the higher education institution location. They have to take public 
transportation or privately owned transportation means. The heavy traffic could mean spending substantially traveling 
time and draining energy that could taxed intellectually. Students overcome these obstacles by living in a dormitory 
during the week. Hence; the demand of accommodation is created. House owners that can spare rooms or able to 
renovate their houses to add rooms started to rent out rooms. Private boarding houses grows within the perimeters of 
the higher education institutions. Considering renting out rooms is a business opportunity, some people with sufficient 
capital build dormitory like buildings that can accommodate up to hundreds of rental rooms. To attract potential renters 
the dormitories provide additional facilities that can cater the needs not only students but also commuting 
professionals. The dormitories does not rent out rooms on short term basis such as daily or weekly. Based on their 
market segment, the dormitories one of the essential services offered is fast Internet access. Even though there are 
several cellular communication provider that also offered Internet access at reasonable price, but traditional Internet 
access which is cable based is still highly demanded. Cable or fixed connection is considered more stable in terms of 
connection stability and speed. The dormitories owners naturally install and thrives to fulfill the demand of the market. 
These private owned dormitories are mostly not run professionally and only considered as revenue generator. As 
dormitories close to certain higher education institutions have students, working alumni and young professionals that 
are financially better off, the ad hoc management of essential needs such as Internet infra-structure is now not 
acceptable. The churn at certain dormitory is high due to perceived in adequate Internet access quality such as speed 
and stability. 
It is therefore necessary for the dormitories business owners to realize that the use of Internet should be managed. The 
use of Internet connection need certain supervision whether the infra- structure occupancy, number of packet loads, 
or operational status of equipment, Care must be taken concerning users themselves such as accessing dubious sites

Under congestion condition of different queue resulted in differences in performance. Continuous monitoring enable 
pro-active action on traffic control. Pro-active control for dormitory set-up need certain resources that will increase 
overhead cost with the advantage of a well-managed traffic that could satisfy residents as customer. Periodic 
monitoring enable the trouble shooting of resident complaints. The measurements results showed that traffic 
performance can be improved if traffic controls are applied. Depending on the applications there is certain control that 
improves its performance as the necessary parameters is improving. As shown RED has the best performance for 
download will small latency, jitter, and packet loss rate. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The traffic management system that make use MikroTik RouterOS shows its experimental capability of shaping and 
policing traffic that is suitable for the traffic that is being carried. In a student dormitory before implementing traffic 
control, the existing traffic must be known. PRTG could help dormitory management or third party understand what

to do. Based on the report extracted from PRTG, the traffic characteristics of the dormitory can be profiled. Prioritizing 
application data packet and implementing appropriate traffic control, would improve the traffic flow. Mangling could 
halved the delay time. Dormitory residents as customer could be satisfied with the traffic performance. Even though 
the model is based on MikroTik RouterOS, PRTG, and Internet access subscription with capacity of 10MB download 
and 1 MB upload for one dormitory, the concept can be slightly adjusted or modified to a larger system. The Student 
Smart Dormitory Traffic Management Model can be adapted for expanded centralized network management of multi 
building and multi-location dormitory system.

Abstract 
As a part of developing the growth of creative industrials in Indonesia, the development of new Creative Hubs has 
become a progressive trend almost every year as the British Council research team found its significant growth 
between 2005 and 2010 in Indonesia. It became one of government and private sectors focus in enlarging the creative 
industry as it offers comprehensive functions and almost no boundaries for development. In regards of this, the 
Creative Hubs needs to be able to support the industries in their works and by which, its need to be optimized 
appropriately in purpose to be well-functioned. Thus, this study aims to obtain aspects that can be applied in Creative 
Hubs, as a creative space, in supporting the talents in their works by taking qualitative research method with empirical 
approaches such as comparative studies through journals followed by questionnaire results study. This study found 
there are different kind of responses when humans were experiencing a room with different kind of aspects such as 
emotional changes by using a specific colour or comfortable sensation when surrounded with wooden material. In 
which, the result of this research is a brief description of aspects that can be optimized in Creative Hub to support the 
user’s creative behaviour. By it means, this research can be used as guidelines for designing Creative Hub or a similar 
creative space that can support users’ creative behaviour which will support creative industry growth. Thus, marking 
sustainable architecture goals by sustainable development.

1. Introduction
Creative Hub, the largest form of Creative Space which include function of Co-working space and Makerspace, has 
growing massively in almost every country, including Indonesia. By its function, supporting the growth of creative 
industries has become the reason on why the government and even private sectors start to focus on developing new 
Creative Hubs (Soenarso, 2020; Fikri, 2021). Especially in Indonesia, where the creative industry is in the developing 
stage and prospecting from its potential, Indonesia’s creative industry can take the major roles in earnings sources in 
Indonesia (Tribuntechno, 2020).  
As the creative industry sectors forms that starting to wider and becoming more approachable to the public, especially 
because of the development of digital era, without a doubt that the numbers of talents or even potential talents start to 
grow significantly. However, problems come when the values offered by talents are low. This problem has become 
one of the main reasons the Creative Industries in Indonesia proliferates slowly, due to many undeveloped talents and

Thus, in purpose to achieve a creative space, especially creative hub, that can respond to creative behaviour, 
adapting on variables from the spaces is needed, such as optimizing the colours scheme, choosing right materials, 
arrange the most suitable layout, and other variables that can results in well-responds space to creative behaviour.  
 
From this research, variables that can proceed in creative behaviour appearance have been obtained, in which colour, 
woods material, lighting, arrangement of space, and decorative. Specific adjustment also requires to be applied to 
creative spaces based on their function. For example, endurance and motivation function can use combination of 
achromatic colour and natural colour, adding wooden experience, allowing adequate lighting, arranging distance 
between spaces, and adding plants as colour scheme. As research result, every function, either its focus function, 
community function, motivation function, and exploring function, has its unique and different setting of variables. In 
which, knowing what function and variables setting is mandatory. Followed by avoiding cross set-up or random 
applying variables should be done, or else it will not assist the user’s creative behaviour but distract the user. That is 
why it is required to adjust creative spaces based its function and variables settings in purpose to be well-responds 
with creative behaviour, thus resulting in sustainable development through creating a supportive place for creative 
industry growth.

Abstract 
Supporting the energy transition toward sustainability, which is increasingly necessary to accelerate, requires research 
to improve the engineering atmosphere with a technology-based entrepreneurial orientation. The situation is aimed at 
the engineers who are playing an important role in the electricity sector due to the potential of stranded assets and 
paradigms of intermittency and new patterns of energy flow. Using a quantitative method with structural equation 
modeling analysis and a partial least square approach, this study explains the importance of the co-creation process as 
a mediator to be able to utilize the technopreneurial orientation among engineers to support sustainability in the 
electricity sector. By empowering engineers to be technologically-based entrepreneurs, they can form a co-creation 
by prioritizing dialogue, which allows shared access and transparency in taking risks, a major aspect that boosts the 
co-creation effect in the energy transition to sustainability.

Restrictions on social mobility caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have reduced greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) 
(Naderipour et al., 2020). Limited mobility has reduced carbon emissions from the transportation sector significantly. 
The changing pattern of electricity consumption is the next consideration, due to the shifting load flow of electricity 
to the residential sector. As is well known, the characteristics of household electricity consumption vary greatly 
depending on the activities and behavior of the occupants (Zohar et al., 2020). Additionally, the characteristics of the

Abstract 
Covid-19, one of the natural disasters that causes delays in construction projects.  The temporary lockdown policy, 
which was imposed at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia, causes delays in construction project. 
One of the project experiencing delays is the construction of the Ploso Bridge. Scheduling methods were needed to 
speed up the construction works. Fast tracking and crashing methods were used in this research to accelerate the 
preparation and soil work in the critical path of the Ploso Bridge. The result of the research is that by using the fast 
tracking method the duration is accelerated by 18 days compared to the normal duration. Whereas using the crashing 
method by adding one and two overtime hours, this reduces the duration of the project by 13 and 23 days respectively. 
Therefore, the crashing method by adding two overtime hours seem to be the most effective method to accelerate the 
duration of the project.

1. Introduction
In this globalization era, the building construction industry has developed rapidly. Not only has it developed rapidly 
in developed countries but also in developing countries like Indonesia. In Indonesia there are a number of 
infrastructures being constructed which makes the construction industry in Indonesia is very developed now. This is 
because the Indonesian Government is now trying to develop an equal infrastructure development so that every 
province in Indonesia can compete with the rest of the world in terms of building construction development (Basuki 
2017).  
However, at the end of 2019, all over the world has experienced the Covid-19 pandemic, which makes delays in the 
construction projects. The pandemic causes all of the activities within the office and in the construction project to be 
reduce to 50% of the capacity. Therefore, an acceleration method is needed to achieve the required target that is set at 
the planning phase of the construction project (Santoso 2017).  
Applying an acceleration method however will result in an addition in the total cost of the construction project. This 
is due to the overtime added for the workers, redesigning the construction method or adding extra number of workers 
available. A method is needed to calculate the most effective acceleration needed for the construction project. By 
applying 2 types of acceleration methods, the most effective acceleration in terms of duration and cost will be achieved 
(Stefanus et. al. 2017).  
Natural disasters is one the impact that leads to project delays, it is unpredictable. These natural disasters that causes 
project delays can be flooding, earthquakes, epidemic disease and so on (David and Bhupendra 1989). The Covid-19 
pandemic is one of a natural disasters can causes project delays throughout the world. This is due to the temporary 
lockdown policy that is placed by the Indonesian Government at the beginning of the pandemic, which set the policy

Based on the crashing method by adding 1 hour of overtime for the workers, the total duration of construction work 
was able to be accelerated by 13 days from the initial duration resulting in the total duration of 432 days. Whereas the 
crashing method by adding 2 hour of overtime for the workers, the total duration of construction work was able to be 
accelerated by 23 days from the initial duration resulting in the total duration of 422 days. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the result of the acceleration analysis using the fast tracking and crashing method, the fast tracking method 
was able to reduce the project duration by 18 days (4,05%), the 1 hours overtime addition reduces by 13 days (2,92%) 
and the 2 hours overtime addition reduces by 23 days (5,17%) from the initial duration. The comparison result can be 
seen in Figure 3.  
 
 
 
Figure 3. Result Comparison 
 
 
Based on the results, it show that by accelerating only the preparation and soil work in the Ploso Bridge construction 
project, the most effective alternative to accelerate the project is by adding 2 hours of overtime for the workers. Due 
to the Covid-19 pandemic circumstances, where the amount of workers are being regulated, the use of the crashing 
method as an alternative in accelerating the project is more suitable. The used of 1 and 2 additional hour of overtime 
in the crashing analysis is due to the regulation imposed by the Central and Local Government where maximum

working hour is up to 19.00. The normal working hours at the Ploso Bridge construction project is from 08.00 – 17.00, 
therefore by adding 1 or 2 additional overtime hour it will still comply to the regulation set by the Governments.

Abstract 
The construction of toll road in project X, located in Purwakarta district, West Java, experienced construction delay. 
In this case, all parties involved in project development must pay attention to various factors that have the potential to 
cause delays in project construction. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the factors that can cause delays 
in the toll road construction project in project X. The method used was a quantitative approach by analyzing factors 
using the IBM Statistics 25 application, the source of this research used primary data by collecting data using 
questionnaire from stakeholders related to the toll road construction project in project X. The results revealed two 
main factors that cause delays, namely “the coordination system factor, document, planning & scheduling” factor with 
a total diversity value of the IBM statistic 25 application of 56.3 %, then “the readiness/resource preparation” factor 
with a total diversity value of from IBM Statistics 25 application by 11.43 %.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to analyze how much time delays in project implementation using the earned value analysis 
method and re-scheduling in the remaining implementation time using the project crashing method on the Sky House 
BSD+ Apartment construction project, BSD City, South Tangerang, Banten. The method used in this research is the 
Earned Value Analysis method and the Project Crashing method. The results showed that the time performance in the 
implementation of this project work was delayed in the 4th week to the 32nd week, with a negative value of the 
Schedule Variant (SV) of Rp.20,727,722,053.85 and the Time Performance Index (SPI) value is less than 1 that is 
0.46 (SPI= 0.46<1). Thus, the normal time duration becomes 258 days and causes an increase of 98 calendar days 
from the initial project schedule. After the project runs or lasts for 32 weeks or 160 working days, re-scheduling is 
carried out by increasing the number of workers using the Project Crashing method and it is found that it still takes a 
duration of 83 days, so that the total duration of Project Crashing becomes 243 days from normal time is 258 days. 
Thus, the acceleration of duration using the Project Crashing method obtained a total time efficiency of 15 days (saving 
time).

1. Introduction
The Sky House BSD+ Apartment construction project in August 2020, the process is still at the stage of building 
structure work. The project, which began in January 2020 and is targeted to be completed in December 2022, is 
unavoidable from the risk of delays. This is due to the magnitude of the workload and the height of the housing to be 
built with a fairly narrow time limit for the implementation of the construction process. The completion of the Sky 
House BSD+ Phase II Apartment Tower construction project was delayed due to several factors, one of which was 
the unfavorable weather in the afternoon. 
The earned value method is one of the tools used in project management that integrates cost and time. The earned 
value method presents 3 (three) dimensions, namely: the physical completion of the project (the percent complete) 
which reflects the planned cost absorption (budgeted cost), the actual costs that have been incurred or what are called 
actual costs, and the percentage of completion of the costs already incurred budgeted or what are called earned value. 
From these three dimensions, various factors can be calculated that indicate the progress and performance of project 
implementation such as cost variance (CV), time variance or schedule variance (SV), work productivity index (CPI), 
time productivity index (SPI), forecasts project completion costs (EAC), and project completion schedule estimates 
(ECD). The results of the project performance evaluation can be used as an early warning if there is poor performance 
in project completion so that management policies and changes in implementation methods can be carried out so that 
cost overruns and project completion delays can be prevented (Ugural and Burgan 2021).  
While, project crashing is to reduce the time of a job that will affect the project completion time. Crashing method is 
a deliberate, systematic, and analytic process by testing all activities in a project centered on activities that are on the

method after the 32nd week or after the project is running or in progress is: 
 
The Total Time Project Crashing Duration: 
= Total duration of the 1st weeks to the 32nd week + project crashing time added 
= 160 days + 83 days = 243 days. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Results of the Accelerated Construction of Sky House BSD+ Apartment 
 
After the 32nd week, rescheduling was carried out using the Project Crashing method and it was found that it still 
needed a duration of 83 days, so that the total duration of Project Crashing became 243 days from the normal time of 
258 days. Thus, it means that by accelerating the duration by increasing the number of workers using the Project 
Crashing method, the total time efficiency of the duration (time saving) is 15 days. This result can be seen in Figure 
2.  
 
5. Conclusion 
The followings are the conclusions of this research: 
a. 
By using the earned value analysis method, it was found that the time performance in the implementation of this 
project work was delayed in the 4th week to the 32nd week, with a negative value of the Schedule Variant (SV) 
of Rp.20,727,722,053.85 and the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is less than 1, which is 0.46 (SPI= 0.46<1). 
Thus, the normal time duration becomes 258 days (if the delayed project work is continued at a constant speed, 
without the duration acceleration method being used) from the planned time of 32 weeks or 160 days, and causes 
an increase of 98 calendar days from the initial project plan schedule. 
 
b. After the project runs or lasts for 32 weeks or 160 working days, rescheduling is carried out by increasing the 
number of workers using the Project Crashing method and it is found that it still takes a duration of 83 days, so 
that the total duration of Project Crashing becomes 243 days from normal time is 258 days. 
 
c. 
The total plan time duration (Plan S Curve) is completed in the 32nd week or 160 business days. The total normal 
time duration (if the delayed project work is continued at a constant speed, without the duration acceleration 
method being applied) is 258 days. Meanwhile, by rescheduling using the Project Crashing method, it was found 
that it still needed a duration of 83 days, so that the total duration of Project Crashing became 243 days. Thus, it

Abstract 
The furniture industry has great contributing for Indonesia. However, its operational activities cause environmental 
damage caused by waste and scarcity of raw materials. Currently, the linear economy applied by most of the furniture 
industry is unable to solve this problem. Circular economy entered as a restorative or regenerative concept that can 
optimize resources and minimize waste. In the process of transition from linear economy to a circular economy, there 
are barriers to its implementation. This research was conducted to evaluate the barriers in the implementation of 
circular economy in the furniture industry and then determine factors that have a significant influence as barriers to 
the circular economy in furniture industry. After obtaining the results in the form of factors that have a significant 
influence, strategic recommendations are proposed to the government and furniture industry. The method used in this 
research is cut off point method and the Fuzzy DEMATEL method. Respondents of this study consisted of the 
government, furniture industry, community, and academia. The results showed that government policies, poor of 
management commitment, lack of knowledge, lack of coordination and collaboration, economic / financial challenges, 
lack of resources, consumer awareness, and lack of skills are the most influential barrier factors in implementation of 
circular economy in furniture industry. Some strategies were proposed to overcome the barrier in implementing 
circular economy in furniture industry.

1. Introduction
The furniture industry is the industrial sector which has an important role for the economy of Indonesia. This is because 
the furniture industry has a great potential in the domestic trade and international trade. The development of the 
furniture industry in Indonesia is inseparable from the support of Indonesia's natural resources. Various issues related 
to the availability of raw materials in the form of wood and the prices are getting more expensive as a result of the 
destruction of Indonesia's forests are still experienced by entrepreneurs in today's furniture. The problem of forest 
destruction not only have an impact on the industrial sector, but also it will bring huge negative impact on the 
environment (Widodo et al. 2010). 
Another problem faced by industrial furniture that is about the environmental impact resulting from the waste of the 
production process. The composition of waste wood in the industrial sawmill includes sawdust and 10.6%, snippet 
25,9% and pieces of 14.3%, with a total waste of 50.8% of the amount of the raw material wood log used (Purwanto 
1994). Other studies also mention that during the processing of furniture, there are at least 7% and at most 50% of the 
supply of wood raw material annual will be the residue (Daian and Ozarska 2009).  
In LAW No. 32 year 2009 article 1 paragraph (2) has been arranged that the need to attempt a systematic and integrated 
is done to preserve the function of the environment and prevent pollution and/or damage to the environment which 
includes planning, utilization, control, maintenance, supervision, and law enforcement. Therefore, the development of 
a sustainable industry into the important things to do. To follow up and strengthen in building a green industry, the 
government issued government regulation No. 29 year 2018 about the empowerment of the industry which is set 
regarding the standardization of the green industry.

European Union in controlling and changing the perceptions and habits of industry players and the public regarding 
waste (Daian and Ozarska 2009).  
To improve poor of management commitment, companies need to build a circular economy business model by 
integrating circular economy thinking, which can be done with companies making the implementation of the circular 
economy a company vision with the goal of developing a national industry as well as an effort to develop a green 
industry. Top level management can motivate all elements of the company to always prioritize the circular economy 
principle to encourage reducing environmental impacts. Creating a group of internal company employees to explore 
and guide the change process (Szerakowski 2017). 
The next strategic recommendation for economic/financial challenges is to increase economic empowerment. 
Recommendations for the government are reducing taxes on environmentally friendly activities, providing financial 
assistance and incentives to business actors who support a circular economy by providing easy access to credit for 
capital, restructuring of machinery or equipment. The restructuring program is given to SMEs by providing discounts 
on the purchase of machinery or equipment. Capital assistance can be carried out by fulfilling the requirements by 
business actors and linking these capital activities with other regulations and policies implemented by the government. 
The strategy recommendation for the factor of consumer awareness is to increase consumer awareness and 
participation in the implementation of the circular economy. Recommendations for business actors are to involve 
consumers to actively participate in providing feedback on products and providing different services to products with 
different warranty costs and warranty periods between new products and circular products so as to encourage increased 
consumer awareness. Business actors can initiate eco-labelling to attract customers' attention with the aim of 
increasing awareness of environmentally friendly products. Manufacturers need to make recycled products attractive 
enough to offset low quality prejudice associated with products made from used materials in order to compete with 
new products on the market (Singh and Ordonez 2016). 
In lack of coordination and collaboration, the strategy is to increase support and cooperation networks. The 
recommendation for the government is to bring together business players in the furniture industry to open up 
opportunities for collaboration in the implementation of circular economy practices. This meeting can be held 
regularly to establish good communication between business actors so that they can help each other. The government 
facilitates the creation of an eco-industrial park. EIP (eco-industrial park) is able to physically connect producers 
which allows infrastructure sharing systems and trades waste products that may be waste from one company can be a 
source for other companies (Hartley et al. 2020).  
Recommendations for business actors are to cooperate with suppliers to reuse them through 6R activities (reuse, 
reduce, recycle, remanufacturing, redesign furniture products that have expired into new products while maintaining 
quality to build a sustainable environmental management system in reducing impacts environment caused. Business 
actors can provide services to customers by reselling used products to companies such as buy-back services. This aims 
to help reduce the number of products thrown away. In addition, this buy-back program also makes it easier for 
producers to get used products. the availability is not always high. This program is also important to reduce the amount 
of waste that goes to the landfill (Bakker et al. 2014).  
The recommended strategy for the government is to facilitate training or workshops in terms of design and technology. 
The government can intensify competition activities for furniture industry business players to improve skills. In 
Indonesia, there is one program called the Indonesia Furniture Design Award (IFDA). The program is a national level 
furniture design competition with the aim of creating the latest furniture designs that meet market tastes but still have 
Indonesian characteristics. Recommendations for business actors are to collaborate with experts or collaborate with 
global designers for design development and product innovation in increasing competitiveness. 
5. Conclusion
Factors that have been identified as barriers to the implementation of circular economy in the Furniture Industry of 
Central Java are government policies, poor of management commitment, lack of coordination and collaboration, 
economic/financial challenges, profit and market demand, lack of skill, lack of knowledge, consumer awareness, 
perception about circular product, technological limitations, quality of product, design challenges, waste management, 
lack of resource, return flows uncertainty.

Abstract 
During the pandemic, most university students have difficulties interacting with lecturers to follow and update their 
project progress periodically. Procrastination is a problem that often occurs in this kind of circumstance. Developing 
the sustainable infrastructure that may be implemented for this situation needs further consideration, and several 
factors contribute. Digital technology scientifically can optimize or improve performance also interaction between 
lecturers and students. Utilizing mobile apps as tools to support the infrastructure of class activities can help break 
down their projects, and it also ensures the sequence stays in the proper order. Constructing tools for students using 
the app Task Management may improve their productivity in running tasks assigned by their lecturers. The 
methodology used is in-depth interviews (qualitative) with students and lecturers, supported by a literature review 
based on Design Thinking for educators by IDEO design by Tim Brown. The authors also analyze and visualize based 
on the data obtained from the research methodology. The results show that there is potential for both students and 
lecturers to use this app in their classrooms as they are likely to use it to manage their tasks and for lecturers to keep 
track of their student's progress and give feedback.

1. Introduction
Many students struggle with managing their projects. These students face problems that include procrastination, not 
knowing where to start, bad time management, lack of information and understanding of the design process that the 
project requires, and lastly, feeling overwhelmed when these tasks pile up. There is no denying that deadlines for work 
can be overwhelming. Impending deadlines have a history of fostering last-minute dashes toward the finish line, such 
as when students pull all-nighters to complete weeks’ worth of projects. Research has shed light on the psychology of 
deadlines and how we can learn ways to improve concentration and enhance perseverance through deadlines.  
According to Liberman’s psychologists, “As less of the task remains to be done, each unit of effort is perceived as 
more effective in closing a larger proportion of the gap to the goal” (Frster et al., 2007). Part of a deadline's 
motivational effect is that it provides you with continuous feedback on how much further you must go before the 
completion of the mission, allowing goal gradients to have an impact (Jarrett, 2020). Most notably, during remote 
working sessions during the coronavirus pandemic, there is a new challenge of a lack of structure to our days and 
weeks. This can cause a feeling of irregularity in our objectives and ambitions, generating a sense that they are delayed 
while we wait for things to return to normal. To combat this, we can place deadlines on ourselves. Liberman says, 
“Deadlines and progress monitoring help keep us in focus and advance our work” (Frster et al., 2007). These findings 
indicate that the strategic use of deadlines may be a solution that allows us to remain cantered as one-week blends into 
the next, paying particular attention to tracking our progress towards set goals (Jarrett, 2020). 
There are many reasons why we may tend to feel overwhelmed by big projects and procrastinate instead. Research 
conducted by Polivy found that our brain fears big projects and often struggles to commit to long-term goals because 
we are vulnerable to giving up at the first sign of distress (Polivy et al., 2010). In addition, researcher McGraw shows 
that “we are prone to procrastinating on large projects because we visualize the worst parts and thus delay in getting

Figure 11. Onboarding Illustrations 
The prototype below (figure 12) was created on Maze. Since there are two ecosystems in this Task Management app, 
consisting of the student and lecturer sides, there will be two different prototype paths. This prototype aims to 
showcase the interactivity of the app user flow and allow for usability testing. The prototype includes simple 
animations for a smooth, friendly user experience. 
Figure 12. Prototype 
Usability Testing The usability testing was conducted remotely through Maze, a usability testing tool for prototypes 
to generate user feedback. The benefit of Maze is that it includes a visually dynamic report that analyzes the test 
results. There were four participants, two students, and two lecturers. Overall, the process was straightforward for the 
testers. The usability score was 80 overall, which is a high score that indicates the design will be easy to use and 
intuitive. When asked if they would use this app for their classes, both agreed they would highly likely use this Task 
Management app. Their feedback states that this app is excellent and helpful and would use it in real life. One 
suggestion would be to add a chat feature with lecturers. 
8. Conclusion and Recommendation
After going through research, analysis, design concept, and experimentation, the researchers, have emerged with a 
more effective way to maintain interaction between lecturers and students through digital design methods. They are 
constructing tools to improve student project monitoring that can be implemented based on mobile apps to avoid 
procrastination problems. For students, it can be challenging to start on more significant tasks as the amount of work 
can seem overwhelming. Therefore, the tasks can be broken down into smaller, more achievable goals in subtasks to 
make them more manageable. Utilizing this Task Management mobile app would help students visually keep track of 
their projects in class with a pre-determined list of tasks from their lecturers. This project has the potential to be 
implemented in classrooms to help visually inform student progress of their projects and remind them of their 
deadlines and for lecturers to give feedback and track their student's progress in every project they assign. It can be a 
sustainable solution.

 Abstract 
Person detection is an interesting machine learning application that can be implemented in embedded devices. One 
such need is to automate an alarm system to detect whether a person that works in a Point of Sale is indeed working 
at his/her working time. This presence monitoring system can be automated by using an esp-eye development board 
by Espressif. In this paper, the key important aspect of modelling the person detection behavior is discussed and 
implemented in ESP32 technologies. The rate of accuracy in detecting a person’s presence is up to 65% based on a 
four (4) minute window-time, and therefore it is reliable to be used as a person’s monitoring automated system, based 
on the current requirement from the food industry. The inference time is circa 0.7 MS, that is the time between each 
sample in a situation whether a person is in front of the camera or not.

1. Introduction
Recently, microcontroller has gained importance in the AI (Artificial Intelligence) world, by their role as an edge 
computing device. Edge computing devices are devices that will work directly on its collected data. And with the 
advances of microcontroller, in terms of clock speed and memory, the microcontrollers are now able to solve difficult 
problems such as image detection, by using artificial intelligence technique called neural network.  
And at the same time the term IoT has flourished, and this has revolutionised the amount of data generated from the 
sensors to a staggering number. And this phenomenon causes a huge problem in a data centric concept, where the data 
needs to be transfer via internet, before they can be further processed to get the desired information. And therefore, an 
edge computing concept has emerged to decrease the data traffic on the internet as well as to increase the data privacy, 
by making the decision right inside the embedded devices.  
For structured data, such as temperature or humidity values, there exists techniques that can help generate required 
information from the data that are generated from the sensors. But for unstructured data, such as image, the 
methodology shifts to what is called neural network technique, in which the input data is fed into layers of neurons 
that will be able to classify the image or identify the objects inside the image.  
1.1 Objectives 
In this paper, there is a requirement from the food industries to monitor their employee working time, by using a 
camera (Kim et al. 2018). Therefore, a web camera will be used to identify if a person is seen or not at his/her 
workplace. The main contribution of this paper is to show that a cheap microcontroller can be used to do this 
monitoring job, by utilizing the neural network technology. In particular, (Howard et al. 2017) have laid a foundation 
for a faster model called Mobile Nets, in which it uses depth wise separable convolutions to enable DNN on an 
embedded platform, such as ESP32 microcontroller.  
The structure of this paper will be arranged as follow, section 2 will discuss literature review. Section 3 will discuss 
software design from the literature’s review describe in section 2. While, in section 4 the implementation will be 
mentioned both in hardware and software parts. And finally, section 5 will show the results.

6. Conclusion 
The proof of working monitoring system, using a cheap esp-eye development kit, is very encouraging for developers 
in the embedded world, to further explore the essence of deep machine learning algorithm. In this work, the ESP-EYE 
has been tested in the retail-food industry, in one of our supermall buildings in Jakarta. And the result has been 
satisfactory for monitoring a person at his/her work’s station.  
   
Future work will focus on developing our own model, using google cloud computing resources, to improve the 
probability of detecting a person, by adding more training pictures, that are more suited to the environment, in which 
this application is used for.

Abstract 
As stakeholders increasingly demand products produced socially and environmentally responsible, Multi-National 
Corporations (MNCs) have since 1990 more and more joined Global Corporate Responsibility (GCR) frameworks 
showing an increased awareness of MNCs about the need for sustainable forms of production in their supply chains. 
Uniqlo is one of the global fashion brands committed to global GCR standards. It will look for suppliers that operate 
in an environmentally responsible manner. In total, fourteen first tier and nine second-tier suppliers of Uniqlo are 
Indonesian companies. In this paper, we have examined the participation of Uniqlo’s Indonesian second-tier supplying 
factories in PROPER, the environmental management rating program of the Indonesian Ministry of Environment. Our 
research shows that since 2015, Uniqlo’s 2nd tier suppliers increasingly participate in PROPER – starting from 2021, 
all Uniqlo’s Indonesian 2nd tier suppliers participate in PROPER. We conclude that this increased participation in 
PROPER may indicate increased pressure on supplier companies from MNCs such as Uniqlo to demonstrate 
environmentally responsible management. To anticipate a growing demand for environmentally responsible 
production, we recommended that the Indonesian government expands the PROPER program to include companies 
with a less expected/potential environmental impact, such as sewing factories, or develop a similar program for such 
companies so that these companies can demonstrate compliance with international GCR standards of production and 
management.

1. Introduction
Japanese Multinational Companies are significant players in the global economy. Multinationals have worldwide 
production and distribution networks and are increasingly held accountable by stakeholders – consumers and 
shareholders - for the behavior of partner companies in their supply and distribution chain. The presence of 
multinational cooperation may bring advantages in the country of origin and the country where its suppliers are 
located. However, the demand by MNCs for cheap products may also have negative consequences, among other 
environmental degradation. (Saleh 1991) 
With the issue of global warming gaining prominence on the world stage, there is increasing pressure on MNCs to 
tackle sustainability, recycling, water, air pollution, and waste throughout their supply chain. The environmental 
policies of heavy industry and mining sectors have long been on the radar of NGOs as the environmental damage has 
been acknowledged for a long time. Since the 1990s, however, the sustainability of the fashion industry and the impact 
of fashion brands and their suppliers on the environment (and human rights) has gained prominence. Consumers and 
other stakeholders increasingly demand environmentally sustainable production. Bad publicity about environmental 
pollution may cause damage to the brand. Vice versa, a ""green"" image will increase the value of a fashion brand's 
products. 
The fashion industry is more polluting than most people realize. It is responsible for 20 percent of global wastewater, 
10 percent carbon emissions, and vast amounts of waste. Every second, one garbage truck full of textiles is landfilled 
or incinerated. Our clothing is also polluting the ocean with plastic. (UN Alliance For Sustainable Fashion Addresses

Figure 1. Participation and ranking of Uniqlo’s suppliers in Indonesia in the PROPER program. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Uniqlo is a global fashion brand committed to environmentally sustainable production according to GCR standards. 
This research has indicated that Uniqlo is relatively transparent by publishing lists of its first-tier and second-tier 
suppliers compared to other Japanese and global fashion brands. Databases such as those published by the Fashion 
Transparency Index increase the accessibility of sustainability reports and other public data published by MNCs and 
will increase pressure on MNCs to increase their transparency on environmental management. Our research has 
attempted to develop a framework to investigate whether Uniqlo's commitment to sustainable environmental 
management moves down the supply chain. Figure 1 shows that since 2015, Uniqlo's 2nd tier suppliers increasingly 
participate in PROPER – starting from 2021, all Uniqlo's Indonesian 2nd tier suppliers participate in PROPER.  
 
In 2020 5 of 6 suppliers participating in PROPER scored “Blue” (compliance) and only the new participant PT Jiale 
Indonesia   scored “Red”.   PT. Winnersumbiri Knitting Factory, the company that scored “Red” in 2019 improved its 
environmental performance in 2020 and scored “Blue”.  These developments indicate that it is likely that suppliers of 
Uniqlo are encouraged by Uniqlo to participate in PROPER and to score at least “Blue”.  On the one hand the 
commitment of Uniqlo to produce in environmentally sustainable ways encourages Uniqlo to advance its agenda of 
sustainable production to its suppliers and to participate in schemes such as PROPER. On the other hand, increased 
participation of its suppliers in PROPER makes Uniqlo increasingly vulnerable to bad performances of its suppliers – 
resulting in bad publicity. While proof of environmental-friendly management is in the interest of suppliers of MNCs 
and may increase the value and the market of Indonesian factories, bad environmental performance does quite the 
opposite, as it damages the image of the brand.   
 
Hence there is increased pressure on supplier companies of MNCs such as Uniqlo to demonstrate environmentally 
responsible management. On a more abstract level, it shows how international commitments by MNCs to adhere to 
GCR standards impact on production and management of suppliers at local levels. As a global fashion brand, Uniqlo 
pushes for the implementation of international GCR standards in all factories within its supply chain. Indonesian 
producers can anticipate such global developments and GCR standards by participating in initiatives such as PROPER. 
Hence it is recommended that the Indonesian government expands the PROPER program to include companies with 
a less expected/potential environmental impact, such as sewing factories, or develop a similar program in which the 
environmental performance of such companies is rated so that these companies – such as the first tier companies 
(sewing factories) of Uniqlo - are in turn stimulated to be transparent about their environmental performance and will 
have an incentive to implement high environmental management standards.

Abstract 
Today, many organizations worldwide from manufacturers to construction building, to governments are still 
struggling to achieve their safety performance by increasing people’s behavior and mind sets to achieve zero 
accident. There’s a tools that can be used as an approach to reduce the accidents called Behavior Based Safety 
(BBS). The value of this tool is obvious. In business, including building construction need an improvement, 
especially in safety, they generally result in better safety, quality, and productivity. Through this paper we will 
discuss how to provide the latest state-of the-art Behavioral Safety Process and ABC Tools for the involvement of 
workers and contractors and building a positive safety culture in the company. By doing the ABC method, we will 
learn how the problem can be solved by measuring the Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequences of the unsafe 
condition and unsafe action to prevent the accident of workers and also to increase safety performance, safety 
awareness, and productivity.

1. Introduction
Bolon house is a traditional Toba Batak house in West Sumatra.The Bolon Toba house, called Jabu Bolon, is square 
in shape and is sometimes inhabited by 5 to 6 nuclear families. House floor height approximately 1.75 meters above 
the ground, so given stairs to climb it. The elements that make up Ruma Bolon Toba divided into three parts 
vertically. Tarup / tayub, namely the roof as a building protection, at the top there is also space as a warehouse and 
where the parmusicians play music to accompany the tor-tors in the front yard. The middle part is a place to live, 
where the main activity of the house is as a place to liveresting place happens here. And lastly Bara, the bottom that 
functioned as a warehouse, usually used to store wood as well as a cage for livestock. The roof of the Toba Bolon 
House is in the form of a shield, the basic idea of this roof shape isfrom the back of the buffalo, the curved top of the 
shape adds to theits aerodynamic value against strong lake winds.Roof construction consists of truss, roof truss, and 
roof covering. The roof covering uses palm fiber material, which is easily available local area. The roof of the Bolon 
Toba house is shaped like a shield, the basic shape of this roof is from the back of the buffalo, the height of the roof 
itself is around 4-5 m.  
Industrial development in the world causes changes from simple or traditional technology becomes advanced 
technology. Technology progressively progressing could present great danger, so necessitated control techniques to 
reduce the negative impact on the workforce, community, as well as the environment (Syahifudin, 2013). Safety 
culture is a concept that concerns humans which have internal aspects invisible (mind), and visible external aspects 
(behavior) its existence is present in a social context (Tarwaka, 2015). Work accidents not only cause casualties and 
material losses for workers and employers, but can disrupt the overall production process, damage the environment, 
and have an impact on the wider community. Losses that occur are in the form of economic losses (such as: damage 
to tools / machines; materials and buildings; medical and maintenance costs; accident benefits; reduced production 
and quality; accident compensation and labor replacement), non-economic losses (such as: suffering of victims and 
their families. , work activities have stopped temporarily, and the loss of working time) (Anizar, 2009). Based on 
data from the International Labor Organization (ILO), in 2012 the number of work accident cases in the world 
reaches 6,000 people each the year. In 2013, the world's death toll due to the work is reaching 2.3 million each year.

6. Conclusion  
Company could encourage their workers to improve their workplace by increasing safety performance to achieve 
company goals with zero accidents. The company has responsibility to provide workplaces are safe and productive. 
BBS can be applied when the worker adopts a positive attitude toward changing and improving the way they work 
and puts the attitude into action. By following safety standard, the workers will have a better workplace with small 
risks. BBS is the fundamental of the company safety culture, as a business practice, a tool, the way of learning, 
thinking, and improving. Within a gradual process that has been an accumulation from many decades of effort. 
People learned how to identify and understood the unsafe condition and unsafe action and solve the problem. 
Company’s safety performance metrics are increasing again within a better observation and it will become stronger 
in the future utilizing ABC concept as a tool in the organization, business practices and culture. Company need to 
develop the safety culture to continue the thinking process of people which involves individuals thinking outside of 
themselves. To ensure the problem solving is proper implement and well addressed, the authors recommend that a 
company need to ensure that employees in problem solving situations not to jump to conclusions that may become 
an obvious solutions. Those solutions normally have a component of emotional attachment which may not address 
the true issue. The company safety culture must engage other team members who can contribute to the deeper and 
better solution. Missing the optimum opportunities will affect to company safety performance and it will accumulate 
throughout the year. The organizations that implementing the ABC and BBS concept should drive, by management 
and good leadership thought processes. With proper training and mentoring, more employees should become 
champions of safety improvement. ABC and BBS must be attached in people’s mind set and in everything that being 
done in the organization to help the employees constantly learn how to be more safe, effective through following the 
safety standard. ABC tools leads to improved Productivity, increased safety, and better morale. When ABC is first 
introduced, many companies see safety and productivity increase by 30 to 100 percent ABC tool helps and lets 
management become more attentive to people’s need because it creates a good environment and morale. The ABC 
tool strategy strives to improve the safety performance while paying attention to results. The ABC method is good 
for many companies to solve the unsafe condition and unsafe action/behavior. The case study proved that it also 
represents a suitable tool for the searching and effective implementing good improvement at the Ulos Villages, 
especially on Bolon traditional house. Method that encourages people to be more creative, explore the critical 
thinking and communicate as a team, especially the improvement team. Innovation needs interdisciplinary team 
approach. Systematic and well-structure approach with the proper steps, which allows to study all aspects of the 
unsafe condition and unsafe action problems with all the consequences.

Open and simply understandable approach that allows to integrate already known and in the company used thinking 
methods by giving a positive feedback for safe performance and corrective feedback for unsafe behavior. 
Transparent process of the searching and implementing the improvement through visual management to measure 
results objectively. 
Encouraging efforts is important when process improvement is the concern. A system should be developed that 
rewards the efforts of workers and managers, rather than simply giving recognition based on an end result. The 
desired result is to have an ongoing effort to improve. ABC is tools of Behavior Based Safety that can improve 
safety awareness and safety performance when we do it together, it build a better, stronger, more profitable 
company. Good Safety means Good Company.

Abstract 
Cancer is one of the most severe health problems in the world. In Indonesia, breast cancer is the leading cause of 
death among all female cancer sufferers. The problem is that most of the patients who come to see a doctor are 
already in the advanced stages. Breast cancer survivors put forward the importance of support from families as 
well as local communities in dealing with breast cancer sufferers. Breast Cancer Community is an organization 
that focuses on socialization and early detection of any symptoms of breast cancer. Therefore, a Breast Cancer 
Community Care Centre is necessary to build with appropriate interior design for its purpose.  It aims to reduce 
the number of advanced breast cancer patients and increase the number of survivors who are aware, resilient, and 
caring. A recovery center and place for breast cancer sufferers to interact and share experiences to restore the 
balance of physical and psychological conditions. This research was conducted through the design process of 
interior design, supported by data collected from literature and interview as well. The outcome of this research is 
an interior design of Breast Community Care Centre that hasa healing environment to support the sustainable 
human environment that focused on human behavior as its user. Hopefully, this research will give inspiration 
through adopting a healing environment approach to interior design to support the vision and mission of the 
Breast Cancer Community

Abstract 
Education Centre for Visually Impaired People in Jakarta is a forum and facilities that provide the activity needs for 
visually impaired people. With the number of visually impaired people increasing every year, additional facilities are 
required to fulfil the necessities in one place to make it convenient for the visually impaired. Those needs are to hone 
and to improve the sensory abilities of hearing senses, touch senses and smelling senses. Not only just to improve 
sensory abilities but also to hone oneself in increasing knowledge, training the ability to see for those with low vision 
and to strengthen mental health. The interior design will pay attention to designs that are informative, easy 
accessibility, safe for activities and environmentally friendly

1. Introduction
In this world, there are all kinds of various people, different races, skin colors, physical form, people that have 
advantages and disadvantages. One of the disadvantages is a deficiency in bodily functions or people with disabilities, 
among them are the visually impaired people. The number of visually impaired people in Indonesia in 2020 is 
estimated to reach 4 million or 1.5 percent of the total population of Indonesia. This number is estimated to continue 
to increase in the coming years. With the increasing number, more facilities are required, especially information and 
education facilities. According to the Law of The Republic of Indonesia, Number 4 of 1997 Articles 5-15 concerning 
persons with disabilities, children with special needs have the same rights and opportunities as other normal children. 
Widjaya explains that a person is visually impaired if during learning process they need or require special tools or 
methods or with certain techniques so that they can learn without sight (Widjaya, 2013). With the number of visually 
impaired people who continue to increase every year in Indonesia especially in Jakarta, there is still a lack of facilities 
to help the educational needs of the visually impaired. It is necessary to add and provide complete educational facilities 
to help visually impaired people.  
One of the facilities that is already available in Jakarta is Yayasan Mitra Netra on Jl. Gn. Balong II No.58, Lebak 
Bulus, South Jakarta. However, the interior condition of Yayasan Mitra Netra can still be improved and optimized. 
Based on the preliminary observations, currently, the only access for the visually impaired and low visions are 
handrails in front of the main building, while inside the building, there are no handrails, guiding blocks, and any other 
accessibility. There are no significant color contrast treatments in the interior elements, the circulation inside the 
building is not too safe for the visually impaired to orientate. Even though it is for the visually impaired, the design of 
each area and room still needs to be considered. Treatments for walls, floors, ceilings still need to be finished with 
color and material that are appropriate and safe. Furthermore, at Yayasan Mitra Netra the overall interior design was 
not the main concern since the available furniture are lacking as well. Classes were just desks and chairs, there are 
even desks outside of the classes that make the circulation not appropriate for the visually impaired. 
According to Anthony Sully, there are nine elements’ interiors include environment; space; light; ground planes; 
enclosures; supports; displays, storage, and worksurfaces; decorations; as well as information. Efforts to fulfill needs 
for the visually impaired are done because they need to learn to be able to live independently through practice practical 
learning and can handle situations with different environments. The physical environment is a trigger for the visually 
impaired people to carry out their activities (Sully, 2012). To help the visually impaired with their orientation in a

6. Conclusion
Based on research that has been carried out on visually impaired people in Indonesia, in 2020 the visually impaired 
are estimated to reach 4 million or reach 1.5 percent of the total population of Indonesia. With the number that 
continues to grow every year in Indonesia, especially in Jakarta, there is still a lack of facilities and facilities to assist 
the educational needs of people with visual impairments. It is necessary to provide and add complete facilities and 
facilities to help the special educational needs of the visually impaired. The education centre will provide a platform 
for visually impaired people to be able to access facilities and information completely and freely. Facilities that support 
and assist in the physical and mental health of the visually impaired. 
Through the concept ""Hulu Bersanding Laras”, meaning to achieve harmonious unity as a source of knowledge, 
education, information, and physical and mental health. In this education center, the visually impaired, especially low 
vision, can be stimulated by the rest of their remaining sight as well as their other senses; touch, hearing, and smell 
through various interior elements such as texture that is applied to the various floor materials or with contrasting colors 
that applied to all interior elements of the education center. Color, especially contrasting color by analyzing their LRV 
values become the focus of the design which aim to guide or help the visually impaired as well as the low vision users 
to the intended place or room, different textured floors that serve as markers for the visually impaired to identify areas 
with their feet and canes, and the application of accessibility such as handrails, guiding blocks, braille, and landmarks 
to makes activity easier for the users 
By applying the sensing aspects, textures and color contrast as a design reference to the interior elements of the 
Education Centre for the Visually Impaired People to be able to help the visually impaired be stimulated by the 
surrounding area that can help them orient and move comfortably and safely. It is hoped that this design is useful 
and can be applied to visually impaired education centers in Jakarta to achieve better quality education centers in 
accessibility, facilities, and design.

Abstract 
This research aims to examine the effect of leanness and product price on the supply chain in Oil & Gas Industry by 
examining the role of local content policy. The data collection technique used questionnaires distributed to Supply 
Chain Management (SCM) organizations from 70 out of 82 companies under Satuan Kerja Khusus (SKK) Migas. 
We received 194 valid responses representing SCM organizations and other organizations strongly related to SCM 
in those companies. The method of data analysis used Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square. This 
research shows that leanness in supply chain and price positively affected social performance, economic 
performance, and environmental performance in supply chain sustainability. The study also shows that local content 
policy moderated the relationship between price and economic performance positively. Social performance is 
proven to have a non-linear effect on economic performance. Environmental performance is also affected positively 
on economic performance. The conclusion of this research suggests that the oil & gas industry should maintain and 
support local content policy to have sustainability in the supply chain.

1. Introduction
In current global development, the issues of sustainability due to unprecedented changes in human and 
environmental systems is one of the biggest challenges for society (Bastas & Liyanage, 2019,de Haan-Hoek et al., 
2020, Aray et al., 2020, Wijethilake & Upadhaya 2020). This condition certainly raises stakeholder concerns over 
the sustainability of the organization or company, because after all, the development of human and environmental 
systems has forced businesses to integrate the company's sustainable strategy, including the sustainable strategy 
implemented in their supply chain (de Haan-Hoek et al., 2020, Carter & Washispack, 2018, Bellisario & Pavlov, 
2018, Kusi-Sarpong et al., 2019). Traditional supply chain management practices are primarily on the economic and 
financial performance of companies. The sustainable supply chain practices emphasize effective management of 
supply chain functions to facilitate the welfare of stakeholders, social communities, and the state and minimize 
environmental damage, which will ultimately improve company sustainability performance (Kusi-Sarpong et al., 
2019). Organizations that have a proactive sustainability approach always tend to apply management best practices, 
such as lean manufacturing, as a means of responding to evolving sustainability challenges (Wijethilake & 
Upadhaya, 2020). Lean manufacturing is an excellent example of the application of leanness in an industry. 
According to Yao et al. (2008), if price sensitivity is high, factory profits will decrease as the demand variable 
increases. In practice, the decision about price is a factor to consider. In some cases, prices usually depend on the 
elasticity of demand. In some cases, prices often depend on the elasticity of demand (Petruzzi and Dada, 1999). 
Currently, the oil and gas industry still uses imported products or raw materials or services related to high

performance (ENV) to economic performance (ECO), a significant relationship was found. The research also shows 
that local content policy (LC) moderated the relationship between price and economic performance positively. For 
social performance (SOC) on economic performance (ECO), no significant effect was found. 
 
By the results of this study concluded that the oil and gas industry in Indonesia should continue to apply lean in its

Abstract 
One of the objectives in interior design is to meet user needs based on their behavior in doing activities. As part of 
interior elements, furniture design has been transformed in terms of form and function adapting to the pandemic 
situation. This pandemic period had a great impact on furniture design for public spaces in accommodating the health 
protocols. A hotel restaurant is a public space that continuously provides services by serving breakfast for hotel guests. 
Although some hotel restaurants were closed temporarily due to the pandemics, it is found that adjustments meant had 
been done by hotel management. A food counter is one of the pieces of furniture in a hotel restaurant that has been 
adapted to support health protocol. Various changes occurred at the food counter with different results. How food 
counter transforms to adapt to the needs of the user, is an interesting topic to discuss, whether the implementation of 
the adaptation carried out has met the criteria for a good design to support sustainable design as well. This study was 
conducted through a literature study and a site visit to the hotel restaurant area. Guest satisfaction is the highest priority 
in the hospitality industry. Designers are expected to contribute by adapting food counter design to maintain the 
continuity of design, function, and material and preserve the ambiance of the restaurant based on the concept. 
Sustainable design needs to improve society constantly and provide solutions to existing problems. The result of this 
study can be used as guidance in designing food counters to achieve sustainable health protocol in public spaces related 
to restaurant facilities.

1. Introduction
The pandemic period has had a major impact on all sectors. One of the impacts is the changes in space and furniture 
in a public area. For the last two years, most of the policies issued by the Government are related to Covid-19. There 
are implementations of regulations regarding public safety and prevention to restrict public mobility. The commercial 
space and hospitality industry has been temporarily closed to reduce activities and prevent virus transmission. User 
behavior has so far influenced the design and is slowly being directed to follow the health protocols to stay safe during 
their activities in public areas.        
Nowadays, it is often found that furniture as a facility in public space is distracted by the prohibition of use due to 
providing physical distance between one user and another. This situation brings opportunities for designers to provide 
solutions in proposing furniture design that has objectives to put user safety first and follow health protocols. This 
also determines that in an interior, furniture design should support the user’s needs in keeping their distance always 
maintained. Health protocols are regulations that must be obeyed by all levels of society. This regulation has several 
standards that should be implemented especially for public buildings by limiting people’s capacity in each area, 
providing body temperature measurement facilities, and scanning barcodes for vaccine proved using the 
pedulilindungi application (pedulilindungi, 2020).  
2. Literature Review
Before and during the pandemic, hotel guests’ experience determines six factors that are significantly mentioned in 
the online reviews: Case studies luxury hotel review in Shanghai, China in 2020. They include services, room quality 
and settings, hotel facilities, dining, location, and environment (Cheng, 2021). It shows that the hospitality industry is

From the data on the Table 1, the hotel restaurant has managed to create an adjustment in their food counter based on 
good design criteria. It is interesting founding that even though each food counter has a different design however they 
have the same purposes in achieving the health protocol requirements. Food counter 2 in Alila hotel – Solo has the 
most “good design” criteria considered among other food counters. This table also proves that human behavior has an 
impact on the transformation of food counter design since creativity in finding solutions for achieving health protocols 
can be realized with different terms of design.

6. Conclusion 
Pandemic has affected human behavior in social activities and interactions. Therefore, adjustment to these conditions 
in the interior specifically in hotel restaurants produced a product that has minimum processed to optimize comfort 
without changing many existing designs. The food counter has an additional shield in responding to the health protocol 
requirements in the hotel restaurants. Transparent material was selected to use as a shield to maintain the distance and 
keep the food hygienic. Good design principles are a significant aspect to apply in adjusting the food counter since 
the hotel restaurant has a sustainable concept that cannot be separated from the hotel itself. The result of this study 
found that the best design principles applied in food counter for shield designs are: (1). Makes the product useful, (2). 
Makes the product understandable, (3). Honest, (4). Long-lasting, (5). Thorough down to the last details, and (6). 
Environmentally friendly. These principles cans are used as references in designing a food counter that is equipped 
with a shield. The recommendation for further study is the material for the shield. The probability of material 
development can also be done through the application of materials that are environmentally friendly with transparent

Abstract 
The growth of positive cases of Covid-19 in mid-2021 in several cities in Indonesia increasing rapidly, research proves 
the virus is transmitted through direct contact through the sprinkling of phlegm from an infected person (through 
coughing and sneezing). In terms of residential, the virus has strong transmissibility within family settings. Family 
cluster is a new phenomenon, especially in urban areas. Referring form the cases of family cluster, a family who lives 
in a small house in housing estate in Tangerang, it is necessary to understand the behaviour of family members, space 
organization, lighting and ventilation system of their house. With a phenomenological approach based on qualitative 
research, the finding and conclusion of this research, that: 1. Poorly Ventilated; 2. Poorly of Natural Lighting; 3. 
Frequently shared spaces; 4. No space that allows for full self-isolation, provides an overview of the typology of 
houses that have the potential to be the cause of family clusters. Learning from existing cases, sustainable housing 
that is adaptive to a pandemic Covid-19 are : 1. Isolated Room; 2. Having access to private sunbathing area; 3. moving 
the public space (living room) to an area that has good air circulation and is exposed to natural lighting.

1. Introduction
Family clusters, one of the high contributors to spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia, Kompas Daily, May 24, 2021, 
published in Jakarta, family clusters accounted for the number of positive patients increased to 6 percent in the past 
week Emergency Hospital, SDC Wisma Athletes Kemayoran, Central Jakarta. This phenomena also found in several 
countries, in United States (US) and China (Song et al. 2020). From China, finding that virus transmitted quickly in 
the form of family clusters (Zhang et al.  2020). Virus transmitted occur through direct, indirect, or close contact with 
infected people (WHO 2020). Living together in house have the potential to spread the virus which is transmitted 
through direct contact through the sprinkling of phlegm from an infected person (through coughing and sneezing), 
transmission mostly indoor setting (Leclerc et al. 2020), infected person (Walker et al. 2021). 
Medical research finding several factors to transmission the virus spread to several individuals who had close contacts. 
In terms of residential, virus has strong transmissibility within family settings and presence in stool raises concern 
transmission (Lin et al. 2021). Live in the same room in the long term with patients enlarges the possibility of 
transmitted, Li et al. (2021) finding three or more cases, the which confirm that sharing indoor spaces with one or 
more infected persons. Other factors potential for transmitted are typical of housing that do not meet minimum 
standard health requirements, minimum of natural lighting and poor ventilation, that poor ventilation potentially for 
spread the virus more and increase of transmitted. Architectural research finding the housing typology that has 
potential to minimize the transmission of virus, to be carried out, research for new design of living model will generate 
new adaptive and spontaneous typologies (Elrahman 2021), with refocusing open space with green area, low-rise 
buildings and better air quality (Megahed and Ghoneim 2020).  
1.1 Objectives 
House should be a safe place, house must be able to face exposure from sources that have the potential to cause disease. 
However, the pandemic changed more, changed people behaviour, stay at home, work from home, learning from 
home, some studies are urgently needed to investigate transmission of virus, in particular understanding people

terms of spatial configuration, in-between spaces such as balconies and openings become central in designing 
residential units (Valizadeh and Iranmanesh 2021).  
 
Architecture is space, the art of arranging space, the organization of space, from a horizontal view identified by the 
organization of space arranged to meet the needs of occupants, in architecture research, flexible spaces and natural 
ventilation and are crucial. Therefore, some important suggestions for Architects and Planners in order to implement: 
1. Isolated Room, each house should have one bedroom that will be used as a self-isolation room, single rooms 
should ideally be placed for infected patients, research finding that self-isolation space if the need arises 
(Spennemann 2021), equipped with a bathroom, has direct access to the outdoor space, to avoid the patient's 
footprints as a virus transmission area, research documented that virus finding in floor surface (Guo et al. 2020);  
2. Having access to private sunbathing, the Covid healing process can be added with sunbathing, access to 
sunbathing and space for it to be provided, sunbathing is good therapy for increase the immune system (Marwah 
and Marwah 2020); 
3. What's interesting is what LS Family did to minimize transmission, moving the public space (living room) to an 
area that has good air circulation and is exposed to natural lighting. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The findings of this research reinforce the findings of Leclerc (2020); Walker (2021); Qian et al (2021). This research 
proves that: transmission phenomenon mostly indoor setting, live in the same room, and in the long term with infected 
person in home enlarges the possibility of transmitted. From the design of the LS house, transmission is possible 
because: 1. Poorly ventilated, poorly ventilated considered to be high risk (Leclerc et al. 2020); 2. poorly of natural 
lighting; 3. frequently shared spaces, such as toilets, toilets are a daily necessity promote aerosol transmission (Ding 
et al. 2020); 4. There is no room that allows for full self-isolation, so the infected person must carry out activities 
together with other residents in the same room.

Abstract 
Hypertension is a major public health problem because of its high ubiquity among around the world. Currently, 
hypertension in young adults is very common. It is because of the increase in lifestyle behaviors with advancement of 
technology and better standard of living. The factors responsible for hypertension among young adults are unspecified. 
The risk of hypertension is very high among young adults as it contributes to an early onset of coronary heart diseases, 
stroke and ephemeral ischemic attacks. The work mainly focuses on the identification of major facets responsible for 
hypertension in young adults and to develop a computational model for determining hypertension. The data collection 
is carried out among young adults in the community through clinical tests. A set of Questionnaires are prepared based 
on the study to analyze what are the risk factors for hypertension. Statistical analysis is done to identify the major 
contributing risk factors and Network-Oriented Modeling based on Temporal-Causal Network (TCN) is used for 
preparing the computational model for hypertension. The novelty of this paper is the usage of Temporal-Causal 
network modeling, which helps in depicting and cope- with causal dependencies, propagation over time. With the help 
of Statistical analysis and Network-Oriented Modeling using Temporal-Causal Network, facets contributing 
hypertension among young adults are identified and the progression of disease is modeled.

1. Introduction
Globally, around 26% of the population suffer from Hypertension and it is estimated to undergo an increase in later 
years to 29% stated by World Health Organization (WHO). Due to the upsurge of advancement in the lifestyle of 
people, the prevalence of hypertension has augmented. Hypertension being a key factor in the onset of certain 
cardiovascular events such as heart diseases, strokes etc.; treatment and prediction of this disease must be done at the 
earliest. Many of the people sail through it asymptomatically, that is why hypertension being remarked as a “Silent 
Killer”. Most of them are unaware of the disease and does not give much importance to an increase in blood pressure 
level thinking that it would be lowering accordingly. But certain times, the level of blood pressure upsurges in such a 
way that it can even lead to death. 
Nowadays, especially in case of young adults, they barely check the blood pressure level. They do not give much 
seriousness to increase in blood pressure. Nevertheless, it can be seen that 19% of the young adults around the world 
suffer from an elevated blood pressure according to a study conducted by National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
Health. In fact, half of the young adults over the age of 20 have high blood pressure, even if they give the impression 
healthy. High blood pressure does not provide noticeable signs, but that does not mean it should be overlooked. 
As said, hypertension does not show any symptoms and the factors affecting it are also unspecified. Most studies 
imply the physiological aspects of hypertension among older adults. But it can be taken into account that some 
psychological factors are also responsible for an elevated blood pressure among people. We can see with the 
advancement in technology and lifestyle of people, the younger generation are prone to various psychological issues 
because of lack of socializing abilities and other undesirable influences. A study regarding psychological aspects of 
hypertension and finding the facets leading to hypertension among young adults are being addressed here. For that the 
cognitive nature of people having hypertension are studied and it is finally modeled using Cognitive modeling 
techniques.

Figure 5. Graphs showing level of hypertension among 60 respondents 
The model is run for the input values collected in survey (Figure 5); the hypertension level (output) curves obtained 
is marked with the matching output values collected in survey. The curve proliferates through a time. The time 
measured here has no specific unit but it just represents the passage of time.  
 
With the passage of time, the variation of hypertension level is obtained through the model, therefore, unit of time has 
no specific significance. Hence, the values shown in x-axis only shows the increment of time and values have no 
specific significance. 
From the graphs given above it can be seen that input variables – mental stress, aggression, depression. family support, 
lifestyle and food habits affect hypertension as there shows a steep increase in curves obtained. The progression of 
the disease along with time are being validated here. The values less than 0.25 denotes normal level of hypertension. 
The values of curves between 0.26 and 0.5 shows prehypertension among the respondents. The curves showing values 
between 0.51 and 0.75 gives an account on stage 1 hypertension meanwhile values above 0.76 represents stage 2 
hypertension. 
The validation of the model brings one observation into light, that is, irrespective of the hypertension value, the level 
of hypertension is significantly affected by the mental stress, lifestyle habit and food habitual values that keeps the 
level from dropping to zero. 
It can be also noted that 16% of the respondents who are having lower family support along with mild depression and 
aggression significantly affecting hypertension. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The existing work focuses on the identification and analysis of the factors that leads to hypertension among the young 
adults and used these factors to develop a computational model based on temporal-causal network to determine 
hypertension among the young adults. The model used was a neurologically inspired computational model based on 
temporal-causal network for determining hypertension level using certain input factors. The input factors responsible 
for elevating and alleviating hypertension were identified from literature review and discussion with medical 
practitioners. The factors were analyzed through Exploratory factor analysis. The questionnaire consists of 28 
questions and the analysis was carried out for each of the 28 questions. These 28 components were extracted after 
factor analysis to compress into 15 set of components. These 15 sets of components are being grouped into 6 factors 
through factor analysis and are sorted according to their function. The exploratory factor analysis revealed the presence 
of six factors exceeding 1, explaining 25.15%, 15.26%, 14.38%, 7.75%, 7.25% and 6.81% of the variance respectively. 
The six factors found out through factor analysis are Mental stress, Food habits, Family support, Depression, Lifestyle 
habits and Aggression. The computational model developed based on Temporal-causal Network to determine 
hypertension is valid since it passes validation test conducted for 60 data points out of 138 data points.  
The validation of the model brings one observation into light, that is, irrespective of the hypertension value, the level 
of hypertension is significantly affected by the mental stress, lifestyle habit and food habitual values that keeps the 
level from dropping to zero. It can be also noted that 16% of the respondents who are having lower family support 
along with mild depression and aggression significantly affecting hypertension. The model helps to know about the 
progression of hypertension with the input values for the find out factors such as mental stress, aggression, depression,

Abstract  
 
The production systems are affected by degradations and failures caused by operational and environmental conditions. 
Indeed, unplanned, unscheduled maintenance (UUM) practices lead to lower productivity, lost production, expensive 
labour (call-outs, overtime) and damaged equipments. However, predictive maintenance (PdM) is a condition-based 
maintenance strategy (CBM) that has become popular among practitioners in recent years that carries out maintenance 
action when needed, avoiding unnecessary preventive measures or failures. Machine learning (ML) has become an 
advanced diagnostic approach in maintenance strategy to mitigate those challenges. Despite that, the ML-based PdM 
strategies are infancy stage due to the immaturity of the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) which is responsible for 
data collection and execution. Implementing ML-based PdM is a difficult and expensive process, especially for those 
companies which often lack the necessary skills and financial and labour resources. Thus, a cost-oriented analysis is 
required to define when ML-based PdM. The proposed study develops the ML algorithm and provides an intelligent 
PdM model with a framework for practitioners and researchers considering aircraft industries. The contribution of the 
paper has twofold. The first is to developing an ML-based predictive maintenance model. The analysis shows that  
random forest outperformed other models scored 28.63 cycles to predicts Time to failure (TTF) within the average 
error range of ±28 cycles. While, the research finding helps to monitor that how to execute data wrangling and prepare 
pandas data frames to define TTF of the airlines engines.

1. Introduction 
With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution, the application of artificial intelligence in the manufacturing 
domain is becoming prevalent (Pundir et al., 2020b; Mohanty and Ranjana, 2019). Maintenance is one of the essential 
activities in the manufacturing process, and it requires proper attention. Nowadays, the plant's crucial facilities like 
monitoring, safety analytics, and predictive quality are mainly driven by predictive maintenance strategies (PdM) 
(Abishekraj et al., 2020). The viability of those strategies generally used data-driven methodology such as machine 
learning (ML) techniques (Pundir et al., 2020a). Primarily, concerning the current scenario, the transformation of 
existing technology into digital technology ensures safety and reliability over the lifetime of the machine components. 
At the same time, incorporating such strategies into the existing company gains more attention among researchers and 
practitioners.",,,indian 2022

Abstract 
Turning, as well as other types of mechanical cutting operations, are absolutely necessary for the machining of 
advanced cutting materials (Inconel718). For the manufacturing of aerospace components, pressure vessels, and race 
car engine parts, Inconel 718 superalloy has been widely used in the manufacturing industries, Due to its excellent 
mechanical properties such as high impact and tensile strength at very high temperatures, high-temperature resistance, 
and corrosion resistance. But machining Inconel-718 is restricted to use in some industries due to the inability of tool 
material to survive for a longer period of time due to the work-hardened effect and it is having low thermal 
conductivity, due to this property, a huge amount of the cutting temperature dissipates towards the cutting tool instead 
of the cutting chip. When machining processes are performed, heat dissipation becomes a more difficult task. Because 
of this, the tool life and the quality of the machined surface are negatively affected. As a result of this, while machining 
advanced materials the Flood coolant (FC) cutting fluid was used in order to reduce the enormous amounts of heat 
that are produced at the cutting zone; however, the government has released restrictions on the usage of alternative 
cooling (FC) techniques to reduce its “effects on the atmosphere and the operator's health”(Gupta et al., 2021a). MQL 
is employed as a substitute for traditional cutting fluids since it reduces lubricant consumption, and environmental & 
health impacts. However, pure MQL cooling does not provide appropriate cooling performance. The introduction of 
eco-friendly vegetable oil (sunflower oil) and nanoparticles (Zinc Titanate, ZnTiO3) into the Minimum quantity 
lubrication led to significant improvements to the fluid's viscosity, thermal conductivity, and wettability which further 
reduces the cutting temperatures and cutting forces. In this research, a number of experiments were performed on 
Inconel-718 “under different cooling conditions such as dry machining, pure MQL, and MQL-nanofluid using the 
same cutting parameters (Depth of cut, feed, cutting speed)”(Tamang et al., 2018) with regard to surface roughness, 
and cutting temperatures.  An interesting result showed that the MQL-nanofluid technique was more effective in 
reducing cutting temperature and enhanced surface finish when compared to pure-MQL, dry cutting. Using Eco-
Friendly cutting fluid with MQL shows promising outcomes in terms of sustainability and machining outputs.

Abstract 
Implementation of best practices in supply chain for small and medium-sized enterprises is crucial for the streamlined 
flow of the business and cost optimization. Studies on the implementation of Supply Chain Management by Small and 
Medium Enterprises are relatively rare and their scope is limited to selected aspects. The sector plays a key role in the 
economies of all the countries in the world. In this context, it is important to streamline the processes within the supply 
chain management. This would save the time by 10% and enhance proper coordination with the respective 
departments. The study also presents the most important elements in the cost optimization of SMEs. The proper flow 
of information and order of processes lead to cost savings by 2.5%. The article is established on data, using surveys, 
books, interviews with subject matter experts’, journals, and online resources collected in this sector. This research 
aims to streamline the supply chain and optimize the processes within the supply chain to optimize the overall cost of 
the business by 2.5%.

1. Introduction
Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a top priority for every business and plays a vital role for small and medium 
businesses. Large business organizations have the ability to adapt quickly to constant change and meet changing 
market demands. However, SMEs have a chronic problem of inefficient management due to lack of financial and 
other resources such as knowledge, human resources and abilities. Thinking in this way, the management of SMEs 
takes the form of corporate management within limited resources. By using these limited resources effectively, the 
goal of this research is to improve process efficiency and effectiveness within all departments of the supply chain, and 
reduce costs across the enterprise, improve customer satisfaction, market share and profits.  
In addition, the recent development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), e-commerce, globalization 
of the commercial world, and pressure to reduce the cost of doing business has forced companies to adopt best practices 
in supply chain management for business success. Forced to do so, these practices streamline SCM's business 
processes to provide end customers with the right product at the right time, at the right price, in the right quantity and 
quality. 
1.1 Objectives 
The main objective of this research is to streamline the processes within the supply chain management. This would in 
turn will save the time and enhance proper coordination with the respective departments. For instance, a single

Abstract 
Online platforms allow customers leave their opinions after using products or services. Data collected from customers 
is enormous. How to organize and transform the data to useful information is one of the most important work to 
improve future business strategies. This study focuses on customer analytics to define the potential certain groups of 
customers so restaurants can concentrate their efforts and to build a database system that includes a satisfaction rating 
scale in order to benefit in the customer's experience. This study applies a method combining machine learning (ML) 
techniques and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), with the case study of customers on Foody Vietnam. Using 
the criteria rating data, the revised Fuzzy C-Means (RFCM) clustering technique builds descriptive modeling to 
discover customer segmentation while Random Forest (RF) technique builds predictive modeling to show satisfaction 
classification. Method Based on the Removal Effects of Criteria (MEREC) ranks the criteria that customers of each 
generated segment rate on the Foody platform, which are Location, Space, Quality, Service, and Price. The results 
give three segments of customers with different criteria ranking and a customer preference prediction. The study 
provides a better insight into customer understanding and therefore, helps restaurant owners in terms of improving 
overall customer experiences.

1. Introduction
Customer analytics is a process which a business uses all of customer data to understand better customer behavior. In 
the past companies focus only on VIP customers. But since the growth of service providers and products, companies 
change business strategies, trying to understand the needs of any customers to retain customer loyalty and increase 
market share (David and Galit, 2013). In a customer-centric economy, there is a trend to use analytic tools in customer 
relationship management to maximize customer value and decide on business strategy (Mirzaei and Iyer, 2014). In a 
competitive industry such as retails, customer analytics is considered one of the most controlling strategic weapons 
(Hossain and Yanamandram 2020). Customer analystics also promise to help the food and beverage industry perform 
much better (Shaeeali et al., 2020). For example, Ching and de Dios Bulos (2019) used different analytic techniques

6. Conclusion 
The study works on the customer analytics problem to help Foody business understand the customers, therefore, make 
a wise business decision as well as benefit customers with better service and experience since service is served 
distinctively. Different forms and promotional activities, different bundles and incentives can be used for different 
segments based on the unique needs and characteristics. 
 
The work carries out three main phases including customer segmentation by applying Revised Fuzzy C-Means, criteria 
ranking by applying Method Based on the Removal Effects of Criteria, and customer satisfaction prediction by 
applying Random Forest.  
 
The results suggest that segment 1 includes the group of customers that have best experience out of three segments, 
segment 2 includes the group of customers that have average experience from the restaurants and segment 3 includes 
the group of customers that have not-so-good experience. In terms of each segment, to improve customer experience, 
businesses can adjust the “Price” criterion for segment 1, create a better “Space” for segment 2 and provide better

“Service” for segment 3. With the predictive modeling created by Random Forest technique, when new customers 
approach the restaurant and give ratings on each criterion, restaurant owners can predict the satisfaction of the 
customers.  
 
The future paper can continue to develop new methods to improve customer analytics problem. On top of that, instead 
of exploiting numeric online ratings, word reviews can be a great source of customer information to work on.

Abstract  
The basic process in metal fabrication industry is welding which poses several risks and hazards to the workers. 
Welding process contributes to work related problems and is the most common method of metal joining and a part 
of metal fabrication work. The present study in to investigate the awareness level of workers to occupational health 
and safety, usage of personnel protective gear (PPEs), welding hazards and postural risks. Metal fabrication 
industries from North Karnataka are selected for study (10 industries) and about 60 workers comprise the sample. 
The metal fabrication industries selected for study were of three types; general fabrication (06), furniture making 
(02) and heavy fabrication works like tractor trailers, pressure tanks (02) etc. The general process in metal
fabrication is cutting, welding, drilling, grinding hammering and painting. The methodology adapted was
observation and collection of demographic data, usage of PPEs, and measurement of environmental parameters like
noise, temperature, illumination, and prevalence of musculoskeletal issues by modified MSD questionnaire and
postural stress by ergonomic evaluation tool Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body
Assessment (REBA). The results show that MSD problems are prevalent where about 70% to 80% report discomfort
in various body parts with lower back, upper back and shoulder and wrists accounting for major score. The results
from RULA postural analysis indicate about 60% postures are high risk in welding and 57% have high risk
according to REBA analysis. The usage of safety devices and personnel protective gear is negligible except eye
shield/goggles which accounts for 90% usage. Masks are used by only 18% of sample and hand gloves by about
23%. The usage of ear plugs/muffs is about 14%. Apart from these the workers complain about general health like
vision problems, accidents and injuries to body and job stress. The study indicates that the sfety measures and
awareness can be further strengthened and interventions carried out to increase workers awareness in areas like
safety training, usage of PPEs and enforcing appropriate safety regulations.

Abstract 
The growth trend in world furniture exports, which has continued to increase over the last few years, has opened up 
opportunities for domestic business actors to increase market share and profits, one of which is PT. XYZ produces 
wood-based handicraft products in the form of perfume boxes for export to the Middle East market. In carrying out 
their business activities, companies often find it difficult to meet the increasing demand for perfume boxes, 
especially during peak seasons. Therefore, the researcher proposes an aggregate planning method using three 
strategies, namely chase strategy, level strategy and mixed strategy, to meet the demand for perfume boxes with 
minimum costs. The results of calculations that have been carried out show that a mixed strategy using the 
transportation method is the best strategy that will be applied to PT. XYZ because it can meet the demand for 
perfume boxes with a minimum cost of Rp. 4,531,944,000, saving Rp. 1,459,124,000 or 24.35% of the method 
currently used by the company during 2017.

1. Introduction
The growth trend in world furniture exports, which has increased over the past five years, has made domestic and 
home decor industry players optimistic about seeing promising market opportunities. Data obtained from the 
Indonesian Wood Furniture and Handicraft Industry Association (HIMKI) shows that from 2013 to 2017, the 
average growth of world furniture exports reached 7.2 billion USD and is projected to continue to increase until 
2020.    
Figure 1. Growth Trends in World Furniture Exports 
Indonesia, as one of the 20 world furniture exporters who is also the third-largest furniture exporter in the ASEAN 
region after Vietnam and Malaysia, is believed to be able to take advantage of this momentum to boost growth in 
furniture exports and wood and rattan-based handicraft products (Figure 1). Referring to the recapitulation data of 
the projected growth of the domestic furniture and craft industry issued by the Indonesian Furniture and Craft 
Association (AMKRI) and the Ministry of Industry for the next three years, both industries have a fairly positive 
growth trend, where this year the growth reached 2.70 billion USD for the furniture industry and 1.25 billion USD 
for the handicraft industry. In 2018 the growth will increase to 3.05 billion USD for the furniture industry and 1.45

In this study, researchers will use three strategies namely chase strategy, level strategy and mixed strategy to find the 
lowest cost. 
2.7 Data Collection Technique 
There are several methods that researchers use to collect the data needed, viz: 
1.
Interview. Data collection techniques by interviewing authorized people and experts in the field of the
object under study. The person can be a manager, supervisor or ordinary employee in the company.
2.
Observation. Data collection techniques by observing conditions, phenomena and facts in the field related
to the object of research.
3. Result And Discussion
Based on the results of research and the results of data processing analysis, the following conclusions can be 
concluded (Table 3):

From the results of forecasting calculations that have been done, the researcher concludes that the most accurate 
forecasting method is the Least Square method because it has the smallest MAD and MSE values, namely 155.55 
and 27.222.22. The projected demand for 2017 with the Least Square method alone is 28,833 units.  
The next step the researcher needs to do is calculate the multiplicative seasonal variation method to find out the 
number of requests each month from the projected demand results with the Least Square method. Here are the 
results of the calculation (Table 4):

3.1 Aggregate Planning Results 
Aggregate planning is a method that researchers use to solve existing problems at PT XYZ, where companies have 
difficulty meeting the demand for perfume boxes during peak season with minimum costs. The researcher proposes 
three aggregate planning strategies, namely chase strategy, level strategy and mixed strategy. The following Table 5 
are the results of the aggregate planning calculations conducted by researchers:

3.2 Results Implications 
From the results of the calculation of aggregate planning with three strategies, the researcher concludes that a mixed 
strategy is the best strategy to be applied to PT XYZ. By using a mixed strategy, PT. XYZ can fulfill demand only 
with regular production capacity so that the total cost incurred becomes less. Previously, PT. XYZ uses a make-to-
order system where the company carries out the production process when there is an incoming request which turns 
out; this system makes it difficult for the company to fulfill the demand for perfume boxes, especially during peak 
season, despite applying overtime and subcontracting hours.   
4. Conclusion
Based on the analysis explained in the previous chapter, the researcher can conclude the following:
a.
The most accurate forecasting method is the least square method and the multiplicative seasonal variation
method. The number of perfume box demand projections for the 2017 period is 28,833 units, where the
highest demand occurring in June at 2,972 units.
b.
In calculating aggregate planning, researchers used three strategies, namely chase strategy, level strategy,
and mixed strategy, to meet the demand for perfume boxes during the 2017 period with minimal costs.
Based on calculations by researchers, a mixed strategy is the most appropriate strategy to be applied at PT.
XYZ because it can fulfill the demand for perfume boxes in a timely manner with the lowest production
cost compared to the other two strategies, which is IDR 4,531,944,000, saving IDR 1,459,124,000 or
24.3% of the methods currently used by PT. XYZ.
5. Suggestion
Suggestions that can be considered as input for companies are as follows:
a.
PT. XYZ must forecast demand with the least square method to find out how many perfume box requests
are in the coming period. A good forecast can help companies determine the strategy of an effective and
efficient production process.
b.
PT. XYZ must implement a mixed strategy that uses transportation methods to meet the demand for
perfume boxes with minimum costs in the period 2017. The company must also anticipate fluctuating
demand by imposing overtime and subcontracting when products produced by regular production capacity
are unable to meet increasing demand.

Abstract 
This study aims to see PT XYZ problem in the big picture, the company's business model is analyzed using 
Business Model Canvas, and the supplier selection is calculated using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) 
method. The criteria considered by the managers when picking the right supplier are quality (71.68%), delivery 
system (20.9%), and procurement system (7.4%). The result proposed the best suppliers for duck meat according 
to the preferences are supplier 2 (52%), supplier 3 (21.9%), supplier 1 (13.5%), and random selection (12.6%). 
The result proposed the best suppliers for boneless chicken according to the preferences are supplier 1 (51.3%), 
supplier 3 (19.6%), supplier 2 (18.7%), and random selection (10.4%). The result proposed the best suppliers for 
mineral water according to the preferences are supplier 3 (36.4%), supplier 1 (23.9%), supplier 2 (23.5%), and 
random selection (16.4%). Compared to the previous practice of selecting suppliers based solely on an 
""approximate"" system, AHP questionnaires have proven that managers consider selecting one particular supplier 
better than random selection, as evidenced by the value of random supplier selection having the lowest weight in 
all three categories of materials which are calculated using AHP.

1. Introduction
Data from the Central Bureau of Statistics shows that the food sector has the largest number of players, nominal 
inputs and outputs, and percentage of population consumption per capita in Indonesia; this shows the significance 
of this industry in the economy. One of the players in the food industry is XYZ Company, a new coffee shop that 
was founded in late 2015, located at Menara Bidakara, Gatot Subroto, Jakarta. According to the interview with 
the managing managers, XYZ Company has a problem in the supply chain sector, like changing suppliers for raw 
materials that are important in business continuity, for example, duck meat, boneless chicken meat, and mineral 
water. This affects business performance, both from the quality of non-standardized products, cost components 
that are difficult to predict and fluctuate, and other aspects of the business (Chan 2008, Ho et al. 2010, Ishizaka 
2009, Saaty 2008).  
So, the researchers adopted a study conducted by Dudin et al. (2015) which states that problems in business 
components (one of which is the relationship with suppliers) can be analyzed with Business Model Canvas. Then, 
Saaty (2008) also stated in his writings that alternative selection could use the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) 
method. Therefore, researchers decided to combine these two methods - Business Model Canvas to analyze the 
overall business model and confirm the impact of supply chain problems on other business components, as well 
as the AHP method to help companies directly choose the best alternative suppliers - based on research Bonnazi 
and Zilber (2014) who show that Business Model Canvas can be combined with other methods - in this study, 
researchers chose the AHP method  (Jain et al. 2007, Sekaran 2015, Walliman 2010).   
Therefore, the following are the formulations of the problem, limitations, and research objectives. 
Formulation of the Problem: 
1. How are the results of the analysis of XYZ Company's business model based on the Business Model
Canvas concept?
2. What is the better supplier evaluation and analysis results for XYZ Company according to the
Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method?
3. What is the impact of supplier selection according to the AHP method on XYZ Company's business
model?
Limitation of the Problem:

4. Conclusions and Suggestions 
4.1 Conclusion 
Based on the Business Model Canvas concept that analyzes elements of XYZ Company's business model, it is found 
that the Key Activity elements (production, marketing, supply chain management) are influenced by the availability 
of Key Resources (raw materials and HR) and Key Partnership (suppliers and building managers) for operations 
business. Without these two elements, Key Activity will not work. The key activity appears to serve the Customer 
Segment, namely employees and young people located around the Bidakara Tower. XYZ Company uses a personal 
and complementary approach for loyal customers to maintain Customer Relationships. For Value Proposition, XYZ 
Company is here to introduce various types of coffee from Indonesia that are offered through XYZ Company's physical 
outlets. For the cost component, XYZ Company spends the budget on marketing, maintenance, employee salaries, 
place rent, and the cost of raw materials (Cost Structure) and gets income from direct and indirect sales (Revenue 
Stream). From the results of the analysis conducted by researchers, it was found that XYZ Company has a problem in 
the Key Partnership section that is still changing. Therefore, researchers help XYZ Company get a permanent supplier 
to solve problems in the Key Partnership element so as not to interfere with other business elements. 
 
According to supplier evaluation and analysis using the AHP method, the results show that XYZ's best duck meat 
supplier is supplier 2 with a percentage of 52%, followed by supplier 3 at 21.9%, supplier 1 at 13.5% and a random 
selection of suppliers at 12 6%; XYZ's best boneless chicken meat supplier is supplier 1 with a percentage of 51.3% 
followed by supplier 3 at 19.6%, supplier 2 at 18.7% and random supplier selection at 10.4%. In comparison, XYZ's 
best mineral water supplier is supplier 3 with a percentage of 36.4%, followed by supplier 1 at 23.9%, supplier 2 at 
23.5% and random supplier selection at 16.4%.  
 
Compared to the previous practice of selecting suppliers based solely on an ""approximate"" system, AHP 
questionnaires have proven that managers consider selecting one particular supplier better than random selection, as 
evidenced by the value of random supplier selection having the lowest weight in all three categories of materials which 
are calculated using AHP.

This research does not change the business model drastically but proposes improvements to the Key Partnership 
element. After the researchers solved the problem at the company's Key Partnership by proposing the selection of 
permanent suppliers on raw materials for ducks, boneless chickens and mineral water, the other elements were no 
longer affected by suppliers changing every time they ordered raw materials. Thus, overall business performance can 
be improved. 
 
4.2 Suggestion 
1. Improving its Key Partnership element by having a permanent supplier which will ultimately impact the smooth 
Key Activities (supply chain), stability of Cost Structure (expenses for fixed raw materials and reduce 
unnecessary additional expenses) and stability of the Revenue Stream (profitability predictable because the 
price of raw materials is fixed). The selection of suppliers can still be done by the AHP method that researchers 
have proposed to determine supplier priorities that must be chosen. 
2. From the results of the analysis conducted by researchers, it was found that XYZ Company has a problem in 
the Key Partnership section that is still changing. Therefore, researchers help XYZ Company get a permanent 
supplier to solve problems in the Key Partnership element so as not to interfere with other business elements.  
3. It is expected that XYZ Company already knows which suppliers need to become permanent suppliers. XYZ 
Company still needs to maintain good relations with other suppliers in case something unexpected happens to 
selected suppliers, so that in such circumstances, XYZ Company has an alternative supplier with the second-
best weight, and so on.  
4. Even though this research does not holistically change XYZ Company's business model, this research has 
shown that the combination of Business Model Canvas and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be 
combined for this case study. Researchers suggest that similar cases be analyzed by methods similar to this 
method.

Abstract 
Companies that produce goods in a large capacity, if there is no good control will cause a risk. The purpose of this 
research is to identify operational risks that occur and provide strategies to reduce failed products that can be applied 
by PT. XYZ. The research method used is to use the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the calculation uses 
Generalized Pareto Distribution and uses the Root Cause Analyze strategy. So, companies must pay more attention to 
the condition of raw materials and check the inventory of raw materials that have been damaged before processing in 
order to avoid greater losses in the future. 
Keywords 
Operational Risk Management, Analytical Hierarchy Process, Generalized Pareto Distribution, Root Cause Analyze, 
and descriptive method research.  
1. Introduction
1.1 Background of the Problem
One of the companies that continues to grow and succeed in the ceramics industry is PT. XYZ, located in Penjaringan
- North Jakarta. PT. XYZ since 1996 through the KITA brand has always been serving customers to meet the needs
of modern lifestyles, through products for floor tiles, wall tiles, and quality, innovative, granite flooring at more
affordable prices.
Each company will have a variety of risks, including operational risks, which comprises seven types i.e., errors in 
manual bookkeeping (Manual Risk), Computer Risk, Outsourcing Employee, Accident in Work, Globalization in 
Concepts and Products, Error in production of Goods and there is no agreement that purchase items cannot be 
exchanged, and damage to factory maintenance, (Fachrudin 2008, Hanafi 2010, Kastowo 2008).  
. 
PT. XYZ in running its business activities is faced with several operational risks in dealing with problems regarding 
production results that experience a discrepancy. This can be seen from the process to produce ceramics that can cause 
operational risks. The indicator is damage to factory maintenance (KMP) where the machine is carried out 
continuously, sometimes damage can occur both from the mower and generator engine that will slow down the 
completion of a project (Aminbakhsh  et al. 2013, Altman and  Hotchkiss 2005, BUMN 2019, APJII, 2017) , damage 
to raw materials (KBB) where employees do not check back the raw materials that have accumulated in the warehouse 
and cause expired , suppliers providing wrong material (SMB) where the employee does not check carefully when 
raw material delivered by the supplier cannot know right or wrong before mixing with other ingredients , risks in 
errors in manual bookkeeping (MR) that occurs every time a project is started and completed, the company writes 
every number of production units per day on the blackboard manually so that when an employee is accidentally deleted 
every amount of production it is feared that there will be an error in the information in the amount of production and 
it is difficult to recalculate and error the goods production process (KPPB) where there is an error in the process of 
mixing ceramic materials or cutting ceramics so as to produce some damaged goods or paint results that are not good 
and below quality 1(Kunjana 2020, Mustafa and AL Bahar 1991, Saaty, 1987, Subana 2001, Wandebori 2019). 
1.2 Formulation of the Problem 
With reference to the object of research that will be discussed, the authors formulate the problem as follows: 
1.What operational risks most affect PT. XYZ in the process of making products?

enough risk. With the calculation of Generalized Pareto Distribution, the company can anticipate the loss so that it 
does not get higher. The results of the questionnaire processing with expert choice. 
3.3 Results of Questionnaire Processing with Expert Choice 
i)
Raw Material Damage 26.76%
ii)
Error in Production Process of Goods 22.84%
iii)
Supplier Providing Incorrect Material 19.06%
iv)
Factory Maintenance Damage 17.86%
v)
Errors in Bookkeeping Manually (Manual Risk) 13.48%
4. Conclusion and Suggestion
4.1 Conclusion
Based on the results of research and discussion in previous chapters, several conclusions can be drawn, namely:
1.There are 5 operational risks that occur at PT. XYZ, namely:
i) Damage to Raw Materials
ii) Errors in the Production Process of Goods
iii) Supplier providing incorrect material
iv) Factory Maintenance Damage
v) Errors in Bookkeeping Manually (Manual Risk)
2. The most dominant value of potential operational risk (Value at Risk) experienced by PT. XYZ from January 2013
to December 2015 amounted to 5,455,825 pcs. The results of the Value at Risk calculation show that the operational
losses suffered by the company are quite high.
The potential loss that exceeds the most dominant Value at Risk (Expected Short Fall) is experienced by PT. XYZ
from January 2013 to December 2015 amounted to 6,139,215 pcs. The results of the Expected Short Fall calculation
show that the maximum amount of loss experienced by the company. The company is feared that it will get a high
enough risk if there is no further handling of the operational risk.
4. Proposed Risk Reduction
A. Damage to Raw Materials:
1.Use ground transportation that is faster than ships like Container Trucks.
2.applying the FIFO system, which is the material that comes first to the factory, will be the first material to be
processed into ceramics.
3.Design a storage area for special materials so that they are not easily damaged.
4.Order raw materials with a minimum amount of standard so as not to over-accumulate.
B. Mistakes in the Production Process of Goods
1.Ensuring that the composition of the material to be processed is suitable and appropriate, not exaggerated and
reduced so that the product produced matches the quality of the sale value.
2.Improve supervision of materials, technicians, systems, and machinery in the production process so as to minimize
the results of wasted or residual products.
3.Factory equipment is always controlled so as to prevent damage and incur costs.
4.Conduct employee training on a regular basis in an amount sufficient to avoid waste for one-on-one employee
training.
C. Supplier providing incorrect material
Ensure in advance that the goods received are quality and not defective.
4.2 Suggestion 
For problems or operational risks faced by PT. XYZ, the authors provide the following suggestions: 
1. Companies must increase the quality of workers in doing their work so as not to add to the losses incurred in the
company, such as the most dominant problem, namely damage to raw materials. To minimize the risk of loss, workers
must be more careful in re-checking old raw materials for immediate use, maintaining the temperature of the room so
2235","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

that raw materials are not easily damaged, double checking whether raw materials coming from suppliers are new and 
undamaged. 
2. The company needs to re-evaluate every operational risk that occurs considering the many advantages in evaluating
and implementing management in these risks. With the aim that the company can prevent greater losses, especially
on the most dominant operational risk, and the company can anticipate these losses so as not to get higher.
3. By using the Generalized Pareto Distribution method, it can be used to find out or as a benchmark in measuring the
level of potential operational losses that occur at PT. XYZ. It would be better if the company could implement this
method on an ongoing basis in order to monitor the magnitude of operational risks in the future times.
4. With companies knowing and applying further operational risk management analysis, the company can directly
support the increase in profits, can prevent the company from failure.

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a service company in the field of marine expeditionary, precisely on shipping or ferry ship with a line on 
track Merak - Bakauheuni. In the registration of spare parts, this process is still manual, and reparations of broken or 
damaged spare parts are still using the official report form. This study analyses the process of recording parts running 
at the Munic Line. Then the analysis will be done to provide safety stock inventory and Reorder points based on the 
lowest total cost, which will also be supported by the inventory system design. The method used to analyze the model 
inventory analysis is the EOQ model, EOI, and Min-Max Inventory. The system's design will use the concept of 
Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the concept of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and design 
analysis based on the model Satzinger with Unified Process Life Cycle stages. It is intended to support the process of 
recording and registering spare parts inventory in the future.

1. Introduction
Inventory is one of the most expensive assets of many companies, reflecting as much as 50% of the total invested 
capital (Heizer and Render, 2014). Operations managers worldwide have long recognized that good inventory is a 
very important and major part of the balance sheet and is often an estimate of considerable value that involves large 
working capital. Without the availability of goods, the Company will face the risk that, at one time, it could not fulfill 
the desires of its customers. Therefore, inventory is a decision that must be optimal to satisfy customers and suppliers. 
Because when the Company also has a stock of goods that are piling up and not being used, it will certainly be a 
storage cost which will cost considerable inventory because Heizer and Render (2014) explain that the Company can 
reduce inventory costs by reducing inventory, but if the inventory does not match demand, then the Company will 
lose customers. To realize the inventory is carried out properly and stably, the Company must apply the concept of 
inventory management that is appropriate and acceptable to various parties. In terms of the amount of inventory, each 
Company has a different amount, and usually, the amount is in accordance with the needs of the Company itself. 
The Company needs supply with effective demand. This has been explained by Mikaelsen (2006) in an online article 
titled ""MANAGING THE DEMAND FOR SPARE PARTS"", which explains that the arrangement of spare parts is 
very important and needed by production companies and service companies. It is quoted from Mikaelsen's article 
(Mikaelsen, 2006) that managing spare parts appropriately can make companies reach their service targets without 
incurring high inventory costs. Parts have several periods in which there is no demand mixed with a sudden surge in 
demand. The following is an example drawing of a lumpy request diagram on several items (Figure 1):

Based on the OOAD and UML approaches used for system design, the new Inventory system has been produced as 
follows (Figure 2): 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. System User Interface 
 
The result is to create a system for inventorying parts that have alerts for a minimum stock taken from the results of 
the inventory analysis calculation from the Company's annual parts purchase list. Use safety stock as a minimum stock 
alert and Reorder point as an alert to buy back parts that have touched the minimum stock number. This can be useful 
to prevent the occurrence of stock out, which causes the ship anchor, and also make a special form menu for the 'Repair 
Parts' menu to eliminate the use of the news form. 
 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
4.1 Conclusion 
Based on data analysis and discussion that has been done in the previous chapter, the researchers can draw conclusions: 
• 
Inventory system processes that run on PT. XYZ has been done manually so far using the official report form 
and does not have an exact calculation of the minimum stock of spare parts in the Company's inventory 
system of PT. XYZ, which can still be calculated using a manual system. 
• 
The calculation method for controlling spare parts inventory used is the EOQ Model, EOI Model, and Min-
Max Inventory. Based on the calculation of 5 crucial parts used as samples, the results show that three parts 
use the EOQ model method, and two use the Min-Max Inventory method. 
• 
Designing an inventory system at PT. XYZ can assist companies in data collection and recording of spare 
parts and can avoid stocking out of parts due to ReOrder Points and SafetyStock in the new inventory system 
that makes the inventory system provide alerts or notifications that the parts have touched the minimum 
numbers and requires a reorder to avoid running out of stock of these parts. 
 
4.2 Suggestion 
Based on the analysis of the data that has been done and the discussion that has been explained in the previous chapter, 
the researchers can draw conclusions: 
2244","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

• 
The Company must conduct training in some of the divisions involved and will be tasked with using the new 
inventory system to avoid misuse of the system. 
• 
There needs to be monitoring or supervision regularly so that the system can run optimally, and it is necessary 
to evaluate at a certain time periodically to make the Company more optimal. 
• 
The inventory system can run optimally with alerts or notifications on each part if the parts have touched a 
minimum number and require the purchase of these parts.

Abstract 
Demand for coal in the world today continues to increase, one of which demands coal in Indonesia. The increase in 
demand for coal will certainly make some producers have to prepare their production capacity to meet the demand for 
coal, given that coal is currently also used as alternative fuel oil. One of the companies engaged in coal mining in 
Indonesia is PT. XYZ. The purpose of this study is for PT. XYZ can continue to meet the demand for coal, especially 
in the future. In this study, researchers used a capacity planning method that aims to meet the optimal production 
capacity and meet all the demand forecasts in the future. Before capacity planning, demand forecast forecasting is 
used as a basis for determining future production capacity requirements, forecasting using 5-year historical data 
starting from 2012 to 2016. Given the predicted demand that has been calculated, the company can find out the 
required capacity requirement In fulfilling all future requests. The addition of capacity has the cost of investment for 
the company, for that done the feasibility of investment analysis using a cost-benefit analysis approach. The results of 
this study indicate that the company needs to increase the production capacity from 13,497,624 tons/year to 18,338,040 
tons/year to have optimal production capacity because the capacity can meet the demand of 18,204,390 tons/year in 
2021. Investment cost. The addition of capacity is feasible because the results of the cost-benefit analysis show the 
NPV and ROI positive, profitability index and benefit-cost ratio above 1, and payback period under five years.

1. Introduction
Mining in the country with natural resources, such as Indonesia, has now become a land that is eager to be exploited 
by various parties at home and abroad. One of which has been rife for the last few decades is coal, which has begun 
to be favored and sought by many large industries to become alternative energy as the issue of oil supply depletion 
and price comparison between the two is quite significant. This situation is read quite observant by local people who 
want to feel the benefits of the land where they stand, one by one the mining company began to stand up and begin 
serving domestic and foreign demands. The high market demand for coal products makes the companies currently 
moving in the coal mining industry must be able to produce products that are both quality and quantity. But besides 
that, the company is also required to be able to meet market demand promptly because if the company cannot meet 
market demands in terms of quality, quantity and time, then it is likely that the market will be disappointed with the 
company and find alternative other companies that can meet market desires (Nielsen et al. 2014, Paulus 2012, Shen et 
al. 2013, Thiruchelvam  and Tookey 2011) 
PT. XYZ is a coal mining contractor company located at Bakrie Tower 8th Floor Rasuna Epicentrum, Jl. Rasuna Said, 
South Jakarta 12940, and has been established in 1991. The problem faced by the company today is the increasing 
complaints from consumers caused by several requests that cannot be fulfilled by PT. XYZ. According to an interview 
conducted by Mr Yohannes Daniel Kristanto, a Cost Estimation Engineer, it was explained that the level of consumer 
complaints about the company continued to increase in recent years due to production delays due to drastic consumer 
demand. On the other hand, the company did not know how to move to predict sales in future periods, especially in 
the long term, so that the company could prepare the right production capacity planning, currently using forecasting 
based on assumptions. Also, the high demand for coal products makes the company indirectly have to pay more capital 
to produce coal. Until now, PT XYZ does not know yet what alternatives can be implemented by the company to meet 
production demands beyond the company's regular capability limits, making the company experience waste of costs 
and often get complaints because orders cannot be effectively fulfilled. 
Based on the background above, the problem can be formulated as follows: 
2246","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

XYZ can handle market demand and can also reach a wider market share. Besides, through the Cost-Benefit Analysis 
calculation analysis can be seen the feasibility of investing in the addition of coal production machines is as follows:

Based on the Table 6, it can be seen that investment in adding coal production capacity through the addition of 
machinery is feasible. These results also show that adding machines in the specified year has been able to meet all 
future requests. The investment value also shows a positive NPV, so which shows that the addition of these machines 
makes the company's production capacity optimal. 
 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
4.1 Conclusion 
Conclusions based on the results of capacity planning analysis, it was found that to have optimal production capacity, 
the company needed additional production capacity because the company's current production capacity could not meet 
future demand. The addition of production capacity is done through the addition of machines. The addition of 
machines consists of adding two units of coal crusher in the year, adding two units of excavators and seven units of 
dump trucks, so the company can have a production capacity of 18,338,040 tons/year to meet all future requests are 
18,204,390 tons/year in 2021. 
 
4.2 Suggestion 
A. Suggestions for PT. XYZ 
The following is a suggestion for PT. XYZ: 
1. Companies are advised to apply the demand forecasting method with a linear regression method for the next period 
(2018 and beyond) so that they can know the surge in demand and can control the movement of demand so that the 
forecast results can be more accurate. 
2. PT. XYZ, it is recommended to increase production capacity by increasing the number of machines following the 
results of existing calculations, thus PT. XYZ can fulfill all consumer demands. 
 
B. For further researchers 
For further researchers, can use other forecasting methods (not using Excel and SPSS tools) by conducting moving 
averages or exponential smoothing so that they do not project trends like researchers do now.

Abstract 
PT. XYZ face a challenge in the form of high production cost, which leads to expensive product results and the 
inability to meet the market demand, which can cause a significant profit loss. This study aims to evaluate the 
production cost that can be arranged more efficiently, therefore, reducing the price of production and arranging an 
effective and efficient production planning to fulfil the market demand. The research method used to evaluate the 
production cost is the Activity-Based Cost Method. The methods used for production planning are Forecasting, 
Aggregate Planning and Master Production Scheduling methods. Based on the result of data processing, it is known 
from Activity-Based Cost calculation that one of the production costs that can be minimized is backorder cost with 
the final amount of Rp37.201.062. Moreover, the best forecasting method in production planning is the linear 
regression method. Thus from the proposed Aggregate Planning, it can be derived that the total production cost can 
be lowered up to Rp120.881.904.

1. Introduction
Along with the increasing population in Indonesia, which is directly proportional to the increasing number of needs 
that must be met, it impacts increasing industrial growth in Indonesia to meet the needs of the Indonesian popula-
tion. Industrial growth in Indonesia has a positive impact on where there are many opportunities for business people 
to start moving in the industrial field. One industry that is seeing an improvement is the paint industry. The im-
provement of the paint industry in Indonesia is inseparable from many other industries that require paint and the 
development of infrastructure, which is also increasingly active such as the construction of residential facilities, of-
fices, roads, and others where the construction is not separated from the need for paint. 
PT. XYZ, established in 2001, was initially engaged in the procurement of goods, especially sandblasting equip-
ment, but seeing open opportunities was the reason for PT. XYZ to start developing its business by producing paint. 
Inefficiency and ineffectiveness at PT. XYZ can be seen from the high production costs of PT. XYZ, causing the 
price of paint products, especially Rincon Paint interior white wall paint, which is the main product of PT. XYZ is 
quite expensive. Production expenses from PT. XYZ comes from costs that should not need to be charged to the 
product's price, but to avoid any loss, these costs are charged to the product's price. Costs that should be avoided are 
overhead costs, but these costs cannot be avoided. 
To achieve good planning in the form of accurate planning following the conditions and situations that exist in the

is cheaper. There is a difference of IDR 389. When calculated from the difference in the cost of production / Kg, so 
when multiplied by the number of products in 2017, there is an efficiency of Rp95,063,412. 
4. Conclusions & Suggestions
4.1. Conclusions
The following conclusions are proposed in this study:
1.
Calculation of costs in production activities can be divided into total costs and overhead costs, in addition
to all costs incurred can be divided by how many products are produced and the cost of production will be
found / kg. The cost of production/kg in 2017 is IDR 9,101 lower than in 2016, IDR 9,490.
2.
Costs that can be eliminated from the production process are costs in the form of overhead. Overhead costs
that can be reduced are backorder costs because production planning has been done to minimize backorder
costs to Rp37,201,062.
3.
The Linear Regression method is the best and most optimal forecasting method for companies to predict
future consumer demand. This is because the MAD value of 4627,623, MSE of 26064590 and MAPE value
of 27.546% are the smallest MAD, MSE and MAPE values compared to other forecasting methods.
4.
In Aggregate Planning, the most optimal method for minimizing the total production costs of a company is
the Mixed Aggregate (Overtime and Backorder) method, where the Overtime method prioritizes maximiz-
ing labor equal to the Backorder method so that combining the two methods will produce a total cost
amounting to Rp120,881,904 consisting of a Backorder fee of Rp37,201,062 and an Overtime of
Rp83,680,842.
5.
The best Master Production Scheduling to be applied in paint production is to use a table that illustrates the
paint production schedule.
4.2. Suggestions 
The following suggestions are made in this study: 
1.
PT. XYZ is recommended to use the Activity Based Costing System Method to calculate the cost of pro-
duction to more clearly see the cost or expenditure according to the activity causing the cost.
2.
PT. XYZ must be able to determine which costs can be eliminated or streamlined, and if eliminated, these
costs do not disrupt production
3.
PT. XYZ should use the Forecasting method to predict demand in the coming period to do production
planning in advance.
4.
PT. XYZ should use the Aggregate Planning method that can be adapted to the company's state in con-
ducting production planning.
5.
Scheduling using Master Production Scheduling can help PT. XYZ in arranging production scheduling.

Abstract 
Employee's workload of PT XYZ is predefined as relatively high if it takes into consideration manpower and the task 
amount. The exceeded workload can affect the job satisfaction of the employee. Hence, it is needed to do an assessment 
to measure the workload and its effect on job satisfaction. The workload was measured by NASA-TLX, which consists 
of mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. At the same time, job 
satisfaction is measured by a questionnaire that consists of remuneration, promotion, superior's assistance, and 
colleagues' assistance. The objects of this study are an employee of the Sustainability and Operation Department. The 
research result in workload is definitely high. Besides that, there is a correlation between workload and job satisfaction. 
There are two correlation models, positive and negative. A high workload can improve job satisfaction, but otherwise, 
it can decrease job satisfaction. 
Keywords 
Workload, Job Satisfaction, NASA-TLX, Correlation, Work Systems. 
1. Introduction
Each department has its own responsibilities and job descriptions that may be related to other departments. The work 
in each department certainly has a different work weight. In theory, workloads must be able to be completed by 
employees. Workloads that are too heavy or light will result in an in-work efficiency. A workload that is too light 
means there is excess labour. This excess causes companies to have to pay employees more than expected productivity. 
Conversely, if there is a labour shortage or a lot of work with a small number of employees employed, it can cause 
physical and psychological fatigue for employees. Eventually, the employees became unproductive because they were 
too tired. 
Based on observations, the current workload is felt to be out of balance with the number of human resources it has. 
For example, in the company's efforts to conduct early detection and prevention of land fires, the Sustainability 
Department was asked to identify PPE owned by the company and monitor hotspots in the company's area. The 
Sustainability Department assigns Safety Specialists for this matter (Hoonaker et al. 2011, Noy et al, 2011, Astianto 
et al. 2014, Widyanti et al. 2016). The employee contacted Regional Sustainability or directly contacted relevant 
employees at each farm to do the PPE recapitulation. At the same time, the Safety Specialist also monitors the hotspot 
distribution map and reports it to the farm if it requires follow-up. Safety Specialists also still need to prepare reports 
to report the results of their work to superiors. Another case with the Operation Department. Employees often come 
home late at night. Even Saturdays and Sundays still enter the office. 
The workload that is too high can cause fatigue in employees. This can be feared will have an impact on employee 
job satisfaction. The potential for work errors by employees (human error) increases. 
2. Research Method
NASA-TLX is a method of measuring mental workload developed by Hart (2006), a researcher at NASA's AMES 
Research Center. According to Hart (2006), this method measures the workload of the type of work, not the workload 
owned by each worker. NASA-TLX consists of 6 (six) scale or measurement dimensions, namely Mental Demand, 
Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration. Behesthi et al. (2004) said that Mental 
Demand is a measurement of the mental burden that respondents receive in completing their work. Activities include

4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
Based on research that has been done, it can be concluded several things as follows: 
1. Perceived workload by Sustainability and Operations department employees at PT XYZ, in general, is high. A 
total of 10.52% perceived high, and 89.47% perceived high. 
2. Workload received by employees can affect employee job satisfaction. There are positive and negative 
correlations. A positive correlation means that if the workload increases, job satisfaction also increases, such as 
the relationship between effort workload factors (effort) and support factors of superiors' support. A negative 
correlation means if the workload increases but job satisfaction actually decreases, for example, is the mental 
workload factor (mental demand) with the promotion job satisfaction factor.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to minimize waiting waste and defect waste in an effort to reduce unproductive time and 
defects in the production of press machines at PT XYZ in accordance with the Lean Manufacturing concept. The 
problem with waiting waste is the high time of miss feed, inspection, DF fault, and product repair, while the problem 
with defect waste is a large number of lump defects. Resolving the defect waste problem certainly reduces the time 
for inspection and repair because the main problem is interconnected, namely ibutsu. The solution for the miss feed 
and DF faults is the redesign of the scrap drain, a stopper for fixing materials, and a vacuum protector with the Poka-
Yoke concept. Meanwhile, the solution for defective waste is proposed to change the cleaning system to prevent ibutsu 
on dies with the PDCA concept (Plan, Do, Check, Act). The prediction for the total time that can be reduced after 
solving the waiting waste problem is 1,786.5 minutes, and the completion of the defect waste is predicted to reduce 
the percentage of defects from 2.48% to 0.5%.

1. Introduction
According to the Big Indonesian Dictionary (KBBI), a motorized vehicle is a vehicle that uses an engine (motor) to 
run it. The types of motorized vehicles in question range from passenger cars, buses, trucks and motorbikes. All types 
of motorized vehicles have always experienced growth in numbers in Indonesia. For passenger cars, the increase has 
reached an average of 8.98%, with a standard deviation of 3.34% since 1989. The growth of motorized vehicles in 
Indonesia continues to increase from year to year (Central Agency Statistics, 2014). 
With the demand for passenger cars always increasing every year, PT XYZ as a car manufacturer in Indonesia, must 
be able to meet this demand. PT XYZ is a company that produces cars under the Suzuki brand name and is a car 
industry originating from Japan. Almost all car components are made independently by the company. The components 
made include the engine, transmission, body, to assembly. For the car body, there are 19 parts made by the pressing 
division at PT XYZ. 
In making car bodies, metal plates and various metal specifications are used. The process of changing the slab into a 
car body is carried out using a press machine in an automation system because the process is done using more machines 
than human intervention. There are nine processes of forming the car body (outer and inner) in the press machine of 
PT XYZ. The process starts from moving the raw material in the storage to loading the material, the cleaning process 
in the washing machine, the waiting process at the destack feeder, the drawing process (forming the initial design of 
the metal plate raw material), the trimming process (cutting the remaining unused material), the bending process (re-
shaping the car body curve in more detail), the reaming / piercing process (the process of forming a hole in the car 
body), the unloading/output process with the conveyor, and finally the inspection process. The concept of lean 
manufacturing states that waste is the main thing that must be done by the company continuously in order to meet the

the amount of waiting waste time and the number of production pieces before and after the proposed improvement. 
From the estimation results, it can be seen whether the proposed improvements will get the maximum benefit. From 
the above calculations, the total additional time that can be had for the press division is 1,786.5 minutes or 29,775 
hours during the April 2017 period, the result of eliminating waiting waste. This additional amount of time can be 
used to manufacture other body parts. The amount of additional production obtained with an average SPM of 14.81 
was 26,458 pieces. Meanwhile, from defect waste, the decrease in the number of defects is predicted to reach 1,568 
pieces, and the percentage of defects decreased from 2.48% to 0.5%. 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion
After conducting the discussion and analysis that has been done, the following are the conclusions that have been 
produced: 
1.
There are two types of causes of waiting waste, namely stop time (miss feed, inspection, DF fault) and
repair in the press machine production process. The problem with the miss feed is caused by the presence
of scrap that has accumulated in the drain, and there is no proper storage for vacuum and fittings. For the
DF fault, the fault is caused by improper installation of the material so that the centering position is not
according to the procedure, and the storage arm is incorrect. For inspection and repair problems, the main
cause of the ibutsu is found on the dies when the press machine is running. This is the same as the main
cause of defect waste, namely ibutsu, which causes production results to become lumpy defects.
2.
The solution to minimizing waiting waste (miss feed and DF faults) is the application of the Poka-Yoke
concept to the design innovation for scrap sewer, stopper (for material installation), and vacuum protector
(to prevent damage to vacuum and fittings). Meanwhile, the solution to minimize defect waste, inspection,
and repair is the application of the PDCA concept in an effort to change the cleaning system in order to
minimize ibutsu on dies and improve the quality of cleaning results. In addition, the estimated total waiting
time that is minimized from the proposed improvements is 1,786.5 minutes and can increase the production
rate by 26,458 pieces in one month. Meanwhile, from defect waste, the decrease in the number of defects
that occurred reached 1,568 pieces and the percentage of defects decreased from 2.48% to 0.5%.
Suggestions from this study are as follows: 
1. The proposed design that has been approved should be implemented immediately considering the amount
of waste that can be minimized and the benefits that can be obtained after implementing the proposed
design.
2. After the application of the proposal, a new work instruction is also needed so that operators can easily use
the new design. In addition, training is also needed to run the production process smoothly on the press
machine with the newly proposed design and system.
3. We recommend that the staff from the pressing division not only focus on increasing the SPM of each type
of car body component, but start to be reminded of the importance of minimizing existing waste due to
inappropriate processes.
4. Maintenance of the washing machine must be carried out regularly to prevent ibutsu that appears as a result
of the washing process and inspection to the vendor must also be carried out to reduce the dirt on the
product.

Abstract 
Designing a good layout and having a high efficiency will certainly reduce production costs so as to generate more 
profits for the company. In PT XYZ, the layout of the machines and departments is still less efficient, which took quite 
far for the materials to proceed and was also accompanied by the backtracking. According to that statement, the authors 
do the design a new layout using Activity Relationship Chart, Worksheet, Dimensionless Block Diagram, Activity 
Relationship Diagram, Area Allocation Diagram, From to Chart, and Material Handling Equipment so, giving the 
result of a new layout that yields efficiency up to 16% of a type of product. In addition, to support the work of the 
operator, design tools were carried out using Rapid Entire Body Assessment and Anthropometry methods in making 
the design of these tools so as to produce a so-called Adjustable Pallet.

1. Introduction
PT XYZ which is located on Jalan Mauk Raya KM. 7 Comp. Industri Karet Jaya No. 8 Tangerang is one of the 
companies engaged in the packaging industry that produces carton packaging or cardboard. PT XYZ produces ready-
made cartons used to package products that will be distributed by customers. The carton or cardboard is produced 
according to customer demand with a variety of types that are quite complex, ranging from various shapes and sizes 
to the type and thickness of the carton used (Gozali et al. 2012, Hassan et al. 1987, Hamamoto 1999).  
Any facilities for the production of machinery, operators and other facilities must be provided in their respective places 
and production equipment in the factory. Arrangements regarding the layout of factory facilities and work areas is a 
problem that is often found even cannot be avoided in the industrial world, even for smaller and simpler industries, 
and can also apply to the existing factory facilities as well as planning facility layout arrangements for new plants. If 
this arrangement is well planned, it will have a good influence on the efficiency and smoothness of the production 
process in an industry (Pradana et al. 1984, Kusjak 1987, Fu and Kaku 1997). Based on observations made at PT 
XYZ, there are several problems that have the potential to disrupt the production process. Problems that occur, one of 
which is the problem of production layouts that are still less efficient, which causes a buildup of material in a particular 
process and waiting time between one machine to another. Because the layout arrangement is less efficient, the 
company will certainly get losses because it takes longer to produce cardboard or carton(Singh 2006, Miller and Gau 
1996, Drira and Hajri 2007). The following is a Table 1 of material mileage and time needed to move material in the 
form of cardboard sheets for small ordinary cardboard types, large ordinary cardboard boxes, small special cardboard 
boxes and large special cardboard boxes with existing layouts:

After doing the second calculation, after adding an adjustable pallet tool that can eliminate bending and position of 
the feet and hands because of the function of the tool, this results in a REBA score of 4, which in this process gets a 
decrease in REBA score. 
 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
4.1 Conclusion 
After making observations, data collection, data processing and data analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn 
from research at PT XYZ: 
1. The best efficient and effective production layout design at PT XYZ is the layout design in Figure 4 . 
2. Production productivity efficiency produced by the 2nd proposed layout listed in Table 8, where efficiency 
of 11% is generated for the type of small ordinary cardboard, an efficiency of 8% for the type of large ordinary 
cardboard, an efficiency of 11% for special types of small cartons and 16% for large types of special cartons. 
So that the 2nd proposed production space layout results in better productivity than the initial production 
space layout. 
3. The design tools that can support production activities at PT XYZ are shown in Figure 7,  lifting pallet to 
assist production operators. Where these tools can help the course of production by making operators more 
supportive of their work which is evident in the proof of REBA that the score is reduced to 4. 
 
4.2 Suggestion 
The following are suggestions that can be given to PT XYZ's factory: 
1. It is necessary to prepare a special area for Finish Goods to be more organized and make it easier to move 
finished goods to the shipping area 
2. It is necessary to consider replacing equipment or maintenance for equipment that is damaged and old (for 
example: hand pallet) to facilitate the operator in moving materials. 
3. It is necessary to relocate or remove inactive machines from the production area to increase production 
space so that productivity will increase production. 
4. It is necessary to make a large box to hold the remaining pieces of cardboard which can be placed close to 
the press machine to minimize the need for space to put the remaining pieces of cardboard material so that 
the environment around the press machine area becomes more organized.

Abstract 
The objectives of this study are to find out the optimal layout for warehouse finished goods, to find out if the re-layout 
of warehouse finished goods which have been proposed provides significant change to the overtime of the workers, 
and to find out the best proposal of labour scheduling for non-staff to make the schedule more effective. The used 
methods are the integrated Class-Based Storage Method, Dedicated Storage Method, From-to-Chart Method for layout 
improvement and Tibrewala, Philippe, and Browne Algorithm for non-staff labour scheduling proposed. The results 
of re-layout the warehouse finished goods are obtained that the space efficiency is 48,66% and the reduction of cycle 
time from 3,33 minutes to 1,86 minutes, and the percentage of overtime decreased after partial implementation. The 
result obtained for the new labour scheduling of non-staff is needed to reduce the amount of labour by as many as two 
persons, so the workers become 85 people.

1. Introduction
1.1 Objectives
At this time, the population continues to grow. This is directly proportional to the high demand for community needs,
especially primary needs. One of the primary needs is a place to live and work. For that, it needs the raw material
requirement in the manufacture of a building. Based on data obtained from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the
trade price index for building materials based on building types in 2016 is as follows: in Table 1 -4.

With a large amount of public demand in building construction, of course, this affects the industry of raw materials, 
which is growing rapidly. This can be seen in the many manufacturing industries that produce building raw materials. 
One of them is a manufacturing company that produces cement board raw materials (Frejyalds et al. 2009, Heragu et 
al. 2016, Jacobs et al, 2011, Kumar et al. 2008), 
XYZ Inc is a pioneer company that manufactures cement board products and has a factory located in Citereup, West 
Java. There are 13 cement board products produced, which can be distinguished by their thickness. Based on 
observations at XYZ Inc, the export market owned reached 10% of XYZ's Inc product capacity in several countries

on Wednesday, workers enter shift II and on Friday enter shift III, then Thursday is chosen between shift II and III 
with the most workers' needs by giving a value of -1 on the selected shift. After doing this stage, new needs will be 
obtained by adding the needs per shift with the schedule. These stages are continued again and again until an iteration 
is obtained with new needs of 0 or negative (Table 8).

From the results of the new scheduling of proposals given, it was found that there were 85 iterations, which means 
that to meet the needs per day, 85 workers were needed. That is, PT XYZ is advised to reduce workers by two people 
to adjust the needs per day that have been determined and reduce the cost of workers' wages and overtime costs. From 
the results of the scheduling, it was found that workers who are on Monday and Sunday are 14 workers, on Tuesday 
and Sunday are 14 workers, on Wednesday and Sunday are 14 workers, on Thursday and Sunday are 15 workers, on 
Friday and Sunday are 14 workers, and on Saturdays and Sundays are 14 workers which can be seen in Table 8 
Calculation Results for Holidays and Number of Workers Off. 
On the 85th iteration, there is a new negative requirement, meaning that there is an excess of labour on that day so 
that if workers want permission not to enter, it can be on that day, or workers can go to another shift on the same day 
if another shift requires additional labour work. 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion
4.1 Conclusion
Based on the results of research conducted at XYZ Inc, the following conclusions are obtained:
1.
The proposed improvement in the layout of the final product warehouse given is to change the placement of the
product areas according to a large number of requests. To minimize the time required, products with large
quantities of demand will be placed closest to the door (I/O) using the Class-Based Storage Method and arranged
in accordance with the principle of first-in, first-out (FIFO) in order to make it easier for workers to pick up
products according to customer orders. To determine the space requirements, a calculation using the Dedicated
Storage Method is obtained, and space efficiency of 48,66% can be used for the needs of other departments. In
addition, determining the proximity relationship between areas using the From-to-Chart Method, so that time
and movement become more efficient and effective.
2.
The proposed improvement in the layout of the final product warehouse proposed provides a significant change
to the overtime of workers. It can be seen after the layout of the final product warehouse is gradually changed,
then there is a decrease in cycle time from 3,33 minutes to 1.86 minutes to pick up products that will be sent to
customers. In addition, there was a decrease in the percentage of overtime little by little each month from 8,40%
in July 2016 to get a percentage of 1,18% in June 2017, which means that changing the layout of the final product
warehouse can minimize the time of work so that this influence the decrease in the percentage of overtime each
month.
3.
The proposed good labour scheduling system for non-staff workers is to reduce the number of workers by two
people to 85 people and 0% over time. In the iteration results, it was found that there were 14 workers on Monday
2302","Proceedings of the 2nd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

© IEOM Society International 
and Sunday, Tuesday and Sunday, Wednesday and Sunday, Friday and Sunday, and Saturday and Sunday. 
Whereas on Thursday and Sunday there are 15 workers off. 
4.2 Suggestion 
Based on the results of research conducted, the suggestions that can be given to XYZ Inc are as follows: 
1.
XYZ Inc is expected to continuously make improvements to the layout that has been proposed for the final
product warehouse so that the layout of the final product warehouse that is owned can be more effective on the
movement of the forklifts and is efficient with the time spent doing the product input and output processes so
that workers become more productive.
2.
XYZ Inc is advised to dispose of old products that have been damaged and apply the principle of First In First
Out (FIFO) on the placement of products sold so that there is no damage to the product.
3.
XYZ Inc is recommended to maximize the use of pallets and reduce the number of pallets to prevent buildup so
that the warehouse becomes more spacious and efficient and can be used for other departmental needs such as
quality control.
4.
XYZ Inc is advised to carry out routine rotating activities to tidy up departmental areas so that the layout of each
department can always be maintained.
5.
XYZ Inc should schedule a fixed schedule for non-staff entry and determine reserve workers in anticipation of
high customer demand.
6.
XYZ Inc is advised to reduce the number of workers in order to minimize the cost of workers' wages and
overtime.

Abstract 
The research was purposed to know the optimal number of operators and equipment during company peak time at 
shift 3 in Regulated Agent of PT. XYZ at Soekarno Hatta Airport. To determine the optimal number of operators, 
the researcher applied the arrivals simulation from 00:30 to 02:30, assuming that the earliest departure is at 05:00. 
The simulation result for the current condition is with the average number of goods arrived is 21,924 kg, and the 
number of goods served is only 12,241. After that, the researcher applied the calculation of capacity planning to get 
the optimal number of lines and operators, and the result was with the same amount of goods arrived able to be 
served 19,752 kg. Based on the capability and time process in Soekarno Hatta, the calculation of capacity planning 
and the proposed layout was made for the new Regulated Agent project of Kualanamu.

1. Introduction
Screening is carried out on all goods to be sent by air to ensure that the goods to be sent are safe and to ensure the 
safety of shipping operations. Based on the security requirements of the airport manager, the screening process is 
carried out in a warehouse so that the inspection process can be easier and the goods to be sent can be stored in the 
warehouse to wait for the delivery departure time. The security area is intended for the screening process so that all 
goods that will fly at the cargo airport are guaranteed security called Regulated Agent (RA). Goods that enter the 
screening process are goods that will fly at a certain time, and before the goods enter the first line of the cargo 
airport, the goods have been confirmed safe for delivery by the Regulated Agent (RA) itself. 
PT. XYZ as the company that handles Regulated Agent at Soekarno Hatta airport experiences a 
condition where the company needs help from the agent who sends the goods or the customer to screen during rush 
hour, which should be carried out by the internal company, and if it is done by an agent who Should be a company 
customer, there is a concern that entering goods that are suspected of being DG, or the customer will feel burdened 
because the screening process takes a long time. 
PT. XYZ, as a cargo and distributor service company as well as managing goods entering or leaving the airport, will 
also open a new business project, namely Regulated Agent (RA) at Kualanamu Airport in Medan to be able to 
support cargo or shipping activities at the airport. 
To provide the best security and service guarantees, companies should implement the Capacity Planning module to 
get the optimal number of supporting equipment and operators in accordance with existing work processes. Given 
that the core of the Regulated Agent business is the screening process and supports line one at an airport, the 
company needs to calculate the optimal number of Xray servers, operators, pallets and the number of trucks using 
the Equipment Requirements and Labor Requirements methods (Leigh 2008, McCaughey et al. 2010,  Mundell et al. 
2013).

In addition, to prove that the capacity calculation and proposed layout are better than those designed by the 
company, a comparison of time and cost savings is made which is illustrated in the following table (Table 11).

4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
Based on data processing and analysis that has been done, the conclusions of the research that has been carried out at 
PT. XYZ are as follows: 
1. In the current condition, Regulated Agent Soekarno Hatta is unable to perform screening services at the arrival 
of peak hours with an average arrival of 21,924 kg, which is obtained from the simulation results of ARENA 
software using ten replications with an average output of 12,240 kg. 
2. With the proposal given based on the calculation of capacity planning average arrival of 21,924 kg can be 
served as much as 19,752 kg so as to increase the company's profits by Rp. 167,083,696.00. 
3. There are two suggestions for the design of RA Kualanamu, suggestion one made by the company, and 
proposal two made by researchers. Based on the process flow map, proposal two is better because it saves 2.56 
minutes for one pallet, and the calculation of the distance saves 4.62 meters. 
The following are suggestions that can be given to PT. XYZ, including: 
1. Companies should increase the number of operators and the number of equipment in order to meet the number 
of goods arrivals during peak hours. 
2. To balance the workload of each porter, the company should implement a rolling workstation system. 
3. The company should buy a long cabin truck with a length of 6 meters to be used as a transport truck to 
minimize material handling.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the development of industries and companies in Indonesia is increasing. Along with the development of 
the industry and the company, thus also develops the need for paper to support the running of the industry and the 
company. Not only industries and companies need paper, but almost all elements of society need paper to support 
daily activities, such as schools, universities and various other agencies. This makes the paper manufacturing industry 
an industry that provides for the needs of various elements of society, namely the need for paper. PT. XYZ  has been 
present to meet the needs of the community for paper from 1977 until now. Based on the statement of PT. XYZ on its 
website, currently PT. XYZ has three factories located in three different locations, including an integrated pulp and 
paper mill in Perawang - Riau, a paper mill industry in Serang - Banten, and Tangerang IKPP, which has the smallest 
capacity among the two other factories but is the most profitable mill. 
There are two business processes at PT. XYZ Tangerang. The first business process starts from processing raw 
materials, namely pulp paper, which will be processed using a machine until it becomes a paper roll. After that, the 
paper roll will be input for the second business process, which is a process in the stationary area consisting of the 
process of cutting, sorting, and converting until the paper material is ready to be distributed to the public. In the area of 
business processes, stationary often occurs a bottleneck and delay, resulting in the non-fulfilment target of the 
management. Therefore, planning and controlling each activity in the stationary area must be carried out. Planning and 
control can be done by measuring every activity in the process in the stationary area. Products contained in the 
stationary area used as observation material are Memo Square No Glue, Memo Square Glue, A4 100 Sheets, and A4 
250 Sheets. The targets for the achievement of the four products is 500 packs of Memo Square No Glue, 450 pack of 
Memo Square Glue, 450 packs of Paper A4 100 Sheets, and 480 packs of Paper A4 250 Sheets. All production results 
are targets per day in one work line. However, on average, the results of achieving production only produce 376 packs 
for all products. The output results that are still far from the target make the research team take measurements of each 
process and conduct evaluations for productivity and work efficiency. Measurements made are ultimately expected to 
increase production productivity and improve the work efficiency of the product work process in the stationary area. 
Measurements of these activities are carried out to see how much time is needed by labor and also to find out how 
much the level of activity is carried out by the companies and workers to produce a product. 
To measure every activity carried out by the company, an accurate measurement method is needed so that it can

4. Conclusion 
The following is the conclusion of the analysis that has been delivered: 
1. Calculation of normal time is done by considering the adjustment factor on each manpower in each work 
station. The adjustment factors are the skill, effort, condition and consistency possessed by each manpower. 
The calculation of standard time is done by considering the leeway factor or loose time of the manufacturing 
process of the product. The easing factors are constant allowance and variable allowance. 
 
2. Current line performance calculation is done by calculating the Line Efficiency value, which is a comparison of the 
total time per work station to the relation of cycle time to the number of work stations. Then the Balance Delay value 
is the ratio between idle time to cycle time and the number of workstations. In other words, the amount between 
Balance Delay and Line Efficiency is equal to one. Furthermore, the Smoothness Index value is an index that shows 
the relative smoothness of an equilibrium assembly line. 
3. Based on the calculation of line performance using the Rank Positional Weight (RPW) and Kilbridge Wester (KW) 
methods, the following conclusions are generated (Table 17).

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a manufacturing company engaged in the manufacture of plastic roof. The products produced are Alderon, 
RS, Flat, and Wuwungan. In production requires a lot of raw materials, but the company does not have an area where 
raw materials. The production process of PT. XYZ uses forklift transport equipment. Obtained material handling 
transfer cost at the initial layout of Rp28,403,362.45. Therefore, it is necessary to design a new layout and design a 
warehouse proposal. Obtained material handling transfer cost in the ARC proposal layout of Rp19,360,439.60 with 
efficiency of 32%. It also created a comparative layout using corelap software. Obtained the cost of material handling 
movement on the layout of the proposed software corelap of Rp23,957,207.44 with an efficiency of 16%. So in this 
case the proposed layout ARC layout is better because it can save 32% cost of material movement from the initial 
layout

1. Introduction
PT. XYZ is a company engaged in manufacturing, which produces plastic roofing. The placement of raw materials 
for roofing at PT. XYZ does not have a dedicated area, so a lot of raw materials are placed around the production 
machine. This makes the performance of the workers less effective, because workers have to look for raw materials 
to be produced which are spread over several production areas first, then take them to a weighing room to determine 
the ratio of the product mixture to be used in making the roof. It is not uncommon for workers to ask other workers 
the location of the raw materials they are looking for, which makes the raw material extraction process less efficient. 
When the raw materials sent by suppliers arrive at the company, workers will immediately unload each raw material 
using a forklift and are placed in various places irregularly near the production machine area or in areas adjacent to 
the building entrance. The use of transportation of raw materials can only be done by using a forklift due to the large 
amount of raw materials in the tens of kilograms to tons required for production needs in each shift. This also makes 
companies have to pay extra in the use of heavy equipment such as forklifts, which are mostly used to transport raw 
materials from the pro-duction area to the weighing area. 
Therefore, in order to support the performance of workers in the material transfer process, it is necessary to improve 
the layout design in order to streamline the movement of raw materials that are placed less effectively to be more 
effective so as to make worker productivity more effective and efficient, and can minimize the amount costs used to 
transport raw materials using a forklift.
2. Research Methodology
This work begins with research methods such as conducting direct field observations at PT. XYZ. After conducting 
observations, several problems were found in determining the layout that was less efficient which could make 
employee performance less effective, as well as irregular placement of raw materials which led to high costs of moving 
raw materials. The purpose of making this re-search is based on existing problems, namely, to make layout proposals 
that are more efficient and provide layout proposals that minimize the cost of moving materials. Then retrieval of the 
data required for data processing such as distance, time, speed, number of departments, number of raw material arrivals

From this graph, it is found that the most significant costs are in the proposed layout (Figure 6). So that we get a 
calculation to calculate the efficiency value of the proposed layout design, namely: 
 
Efficiency  
= 
Initial cost - Proposed layout fee
Initial cost
  x 100 
 
 
= 
 Rp28,403,362.45- Rp19,360,439.60
Rp28,403,362.45
 x 100 
 
 
= 
9,042,922.8
28,403,362.45 
 
 
= 31,8 % 
 
So that the efficiency obtained from the proposed layout and material transfer costs in the proposed layout has the 
lowest efficiency value. So that the proposed layout is the optimal layout in designing a new layout. 
 
4. Conclusions and Suggestions 
4.1 Conclusion 
The following are the conclusions and suggestions from the research that has been done: 
• 
To support a more effective and efficient work process, the layout arrangement can be started by changing the 
department layout by sequencing the work process in order to determine the sequence of the production process. 
The proposed layout is done by using the ARC method, sequencing the production process to determine whether 
or not the relationship between these departments is important, after which the data is processed into a worksheet 
so that it is easy to read the results of the ARC. Then the results from the worksheet are made into a dimensionless 
diagram to apply the proposed layout design to ARC which has been made manually, the most effective and 
efficient layout is in manual ARC layouts, because the manufacturing process takes into account other details 
such as worksheets and dimensionless. diagram. 
 
• 
Efforts to minimize the cost of moving the initial raw material can be done by minimizing the distance from the 
raw material itself. From the results of data processing, to obtain an effective raw material transfer distance 
required a new layout proposal that has been made manually. This is because the proposed displacement distance 
in the proposed ARC layout is Rp19.360.439,60 with an efficiency of 32%. This is already effective compared to

the transfer of raw material in the initial layout of Rp28.403.362,45 and the proposed layout of the corelap of 
Rp23.957.207,44. 
4.2 Suggestion 
There are suggestions that can be given to solve the problems that exist in PT. XYZ namely: 
•
In providing an effective layout and small raw material transfer distance, a warehouse that has been designed in
sub-chapter 4.3.8 is created. The warehouse is made to provide an effective layout so that the production line in
the initial layout is not disturbed by raw materials on each side of the production area.

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a company which is concerned in the manufacture of air conditioning. The problem with the current layout 
is that each interconnected area has a great distance, and there are backtracking, cross-movement, and does not have 
one flow process. The problem makes the time of this fabrication process to be long or less effective and due to the 
distance between the distant areas, causing the distance of material handling moves that are less effective. The long 
distances can affect the timing of product displacement and the cost of material handling. In this research, the design 
is created an ergonomic design for the table in the housing area with the aim of increasing the optimality of the 
fabrication process in PT. XYZ and redesign the layout of each area using the CORELAP Method. The CORELAP 
Method consists of three stages: the analysis phase, the adjustment stage, and the evaluation stage. The analysis phase 
includes material flow analysis, Activity Relationship Chart (ARC) analysis, and the space of the available area. The 
adjustment stage is the stage to arrange the layout of proposed results from the CORELAP Method and adapt to the 
needs or circumstances of the field. The last stage is the evaluation stage, which is to compare the actual layout and 
the proposed layout. CORELAP Method is adapted to the needs and conditions in the field to produce the optimal 
layout that has one flow process of the fabrication process and save the material handling cost of Rp877.622,31 or 
save material handling cost of 62,53% compared to the actual layout.

1. Introduction
PT. XYZ is a company engaged in the manufacture of air conditioners. For office buildings or shopping centres, and 
mining areas, AC (Air Condition) is commonly referred to as AHU (Air Handling Unit) or HVAC (Heating, 
Ventilation, & Air Condition). This company produces HVAC, which is used to control room temperature, room 
humidity, and air movement. McDowall (2007). The problem that exists in this company lies in the current layout, 
which is located in each related area which has a large distance, and the current layout has backtracking, cross-
movement, and grooves that do not have one flow process. Therefore, for the current layout, it is necessary to hold a 
re-layout to improve the fabrication process of products made at a more optimal distance in reducing the cost of 
material handling. 
In supporting a good product-making process, apart from seeing the layout of each area in the production process, it 
can also be seen how the work process is carried out by the workers themselves. Workers who are working on a 
production process must also have a comfortable and safe position. The table in the housing area is currently not 
suitable for Indonesian anthropometry because the table is too low for the housing process on the electrical control 
panel and too high for the process of assembling the HVAC framework. In improving the ergonomics of the work 
process carried out by workers, the table must be adjusted to the size/dimensions of the human body and several 
features are also needed to help workers put the tools needed during the product assembly process, which can also 
reduce material handling displacement (Deb and Jain 2013, Hasan et al. 2013, Ausaf et al. 2015, Dou et al. 2016, Hees 
2015, Koren et al. 2018, Yang et al. 2021). 
. 
After that, the problem formulation that can be taken is how the optimal layout for the HVAC fabrication process at 
PT. XYZ, how much material handling costs must be spent on the actual layout at PT. XYZ, what is the total material 
handling cost savings in the fabrication process between the actual layout and layout proposal, and how to design a

4. Conclusions and Suggestions 
Based on the results of the processing and analysis that has been made, several conclusions are obtained, namely as 
follows: 
1. The optimal layout for the HVAC fabrication process at PT. XYZ is that there are no more layouts with 
backtracking, cross-movement, and one flow process. In the proposed layout, the design room and meeting room 
1 (large), which were previously adjacent to the warehouse, were removed, and doors were made in the design 
room and meeting room so that the trajectory to be taken would be fewer and more effective in reducing material 
handling costs. It will be issued by the company. In addition, parts of the material area, measuring area, cutting 
area, corner-cutting area, bending area, and bending press area are also placed close to the warehouse, and these 
areas have been adjusted to the fabrication process due to back tracking and cross-movement in the previous 
layout. Other areas are also placed close together according to the fabrication process of each product made. 
2. The total material handling costs for PT. XYZ that must be spent on the actual layout is IDR 1,403,526.27, with 
the total distance for each related area of 1442.4m. 
3. Total material handling cost savings for the proposed layout is IDR877,622.31. With a percentage of material 
handling cost savings of 62.53%. 
4. The proposed table design for the housing area is made based on the needs of the fabrication process and the 
workers at work. The proposed table has been made using Indonesian dimensions. In addition, the proposed table 
is made using the 50th Percentile (P50) based on the average Indonesian person and worker. The table is made to 
have different heights to suit what product will be made. The dimensions used in making the first table, namely 
to assemble the HVAC body frame, are dimensions in sitting positions such as D16, D12, and D11, namely 
popliteal height (43.09cm), thigh thickness (18.79cm), and elbow height in a sitting position (31.84cm) with the 
allowance from the groin to the end of the table which is 13.09cm from the result of subtracting D11 and D12. 
For the table to assemble the electricity control panel, use the dimensions in the standing position, namely D4 
with elbow height in the standing position with a size of 102.82cm. With the height of the board, namely using 
the dimensions of an Indonesian in a standing position, namely D2 with an eye height of 154.47cm. 
 
Here are suggestions that companies can use: 
1. The company re-layout based on the results of research using the CORELAP method because, with this layout, 
the company can optimize the fabrication process, which has an impact on reducing material handling costs. 
2. Applying ergonomic principles to make the proposed table in the housing area so that companies can improve 
work efficiency in the housing area. 
3. There is a need for a safety colour for each area to increase the awareness of workers to be more careful and 
thorough when working.

Abstract 
The objective of study in PT. XYZ is to determine the best supplier, warehouse repair procedures, and the level of 
health and safety. The method used is Analytical Hierarchy Process Method for supplier selection, ABC Analysis and 
From-to-Chart Method for warehouse improvement, and REBA and Job Hazard Analysis calculation to observe health 
and work safety level. The results obtained by the best suppliers are Americans with a value of 40.56%, Warehouse 
arrangement based on the result of attraction 3 with the value of 403 hoist and followed by the calculation of ABC 
Analysis where classification A has 12 items, classification B with 19 items, and classification C with 32 items. The 
results of REBA calculations when picking up goods and signatures machines are 6 and 10, which indicates a moderate 
risk and high risk and requiring a change. Job Hazard Analysis results indicate a risk of danger during the process of 
unloading and shipping process so that it needs a change

1. Introduction
Visual problems and blindness are problems that need to be addressed. This is because the condition of visual 
impairment and blindness can affect the quality of life of Indonesian people. Currently, many eye vision problems 
occur in children. The cause is a refraction disorder caused by changes in lifestyle that rely on technology or addiction 
to gadgets. This condition can affect the process of receiving in-formation in learning activities. In the end, if the 
refractive disorder in school-age children is not corrected, it will have fatal consequences, namely a decrease in 
intelligence and learning achievement. Moeloek (2016) 
The Minister of Health, Moeloek (2016) appealed to all governors, regents and mayors throughout Indonesia to sup-
port the implementation of the Movement for Overcoming Vision Disorders and Blindness by in-volving all parties, 
both public, private, NGOs, professions, associations, as well as educational institutions. The socialization, he 
continued, is an effort to convey information to the entire community, that blindness is a major public health problem 
in the world that can be prevented, treated and rehabilitated. Increasing the awareness of all parties regarding the 
importance of preventing and overcoming vision problems and blindness, through promotional activities, screening 
or early detection of visual disturbances and blindness in the community, which are followed up with corrective action 
or appropriate treatment.  
Based on data from the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) blindness survey con-ducted by the 
Association of Indonesian Ophthalmologists (Perdami) and the Research and Development Agency, in 2014-2015 in 
seven provinces, the main causes of blindness in Indonesia are cataracts (70-80%) and glaucoma. The only way to 
prevent blindness due to cataracts is surgery. Meanwhile, the main cause of visual disturbances is refractive errors 
(10-15%). Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006 estimated that around 153 million people in 
the world experienced uncorrected refractive errors. Of these 153 million people, around 13 million are children aged 
5-15 years, with the highest prevalence occurring in Southeast Asia (Min et al. 1999, Tahrir et al. 2008, Tam et al.
2001)
For the main supplier of Abbot Medical Optics (AMO) brand cataract eye lens products, PT. XYZ uses Singapore as 
the main supplier. The problem with this supplier is that the payment due date is too fast while the goods are still not

4. Conclusions and Suggestions 
Based on the results of the analysis and discussion at the PT. XYZ warehouse, it can be concluded as follows: 
1. To determine the best supplier by weighting the criteria for all PT. XYZ suppliers using the analytical hierarchy 
process method, which prioritizes the quality aspect of its delivery. It can be concluded that American suppliers 
with a selection percentage of 40.56% are the best among other suppliers. 
2. To determine a good and efficient warehouse layout, PT. XYZ uses the From-to-chart (FTC) method and ABC 
Analysis in grouping goods. The best results were obtained after doing the calculation 3 times with a total flow 
distance value of 403 movements and a max value of 52. The proposed layout is based on the level of activity 
between one area and another which has a very important relationship so that the area becomes close together. 
That way all the activities and time spent by workers at the PT. XYZ warehouse are optimal. 
3. To determine the recommendations for work safety and security for PT. XYZ employees, the REBA calculation 
method & job hazzard analysis are used. In the process of lifting goods and signature machines, the REBA 
calculations obtained are 6 & 10, which means that it is risky and at risk of living, it requires a change in the way 
of working. Then the results of the job hazzard analysis, found several things that are potentially dangerous, 
namely when receiving goods and delivery of goods, where the process requires improvement.              
 
After a conclusion is drawn, the suggestions that can be given are: 
1. Making suppliers America as a supplier of PT. XYZ. However, it is possible to order goods from other countries 
to cover urgent needs by using a smaller lead time from American suppliers. 
2. Employees can use trolleys when moving goods, both on receiving and packaging. Then when sending employees 
who use motorbikes can use additional delivery boxes. This aims to minimize the possibility of accidents.

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a building equipment retail company which is located in Alam Sutera, Tangerang. Flooring which consists 
of ceramic and granite sales was become one of the featured products and has the highest sales frequency. Therefore, 
flooring has a direct impact on the current warehouse capacity of 85%. Due to limited company warehouse area and 
capacity, an analysis of warehouse capacity requirements using space requirements tools is conducted. Based on the 
result of the space requirements tools, the minimum area required reaches 3,717,28 m2, hence, PT. XYZ should makes 
the decision to rent a warehouse outside the company area. The method that supports is Analytical Hierarchy Process 
(AHP). There are 4 preferred locations that have been assigned as an alternative leased warehouse. The selected 
alternative warehouse with percentage 43,7% is a leased warehouse owned by PT. XYZ located in Daan Mogot Km 
21. The design of the chosen leased warehouse uses the ABC Analysis Method to classify the goods and the Office
Layout Technique Method to design the office layout. The results from the ABC Analysis are, from the 11 products
available, 5 products classified as A, 2 products classified as B, and 4 products classified as C. the results from the
Office Layout Technique Method shows that the space and area needed for office space is 71,19m2

1. Introduction
PT. XYZ is a company engaged in the retail of building material equipment. Observations while in the company show 
that 85% of the capacity of the entire warehouse is dominated by flooring (tiles) which have 2 types of materials, 
including ceramic and granite. 85% of the capacity of flooring products includes 2, 4A, 4B, and 5 warehouses. Variety, 
resulting in reduced storage space which reduces air circulation due to too high a pallet stack. The company needs to 
evaluate the safe area needed in 2016. Due to the limited land area of PT. XYZ, the company may need to rent a 
warehouse outside the company's area, so it needs observation of alternative prospective rental warehouses. When an 
alternative rental warehouse candidate is selected, the research continues to design the proposed rental warehouse 
layout.
2. Research Methods
The research methodology begins with conducting field observations at PT. XYZ by looking at the warehousing 
conditions of ceramic and granite products. After making observations, you can identify the problems in the 
warehouse. Furthermore, the problem limitation is carried out from the existing problems to be used as a discussion 
of the problems taken. Furthermore, from problem limitation, several problem formulations can be drawn. Then data 
collection in the form of primary and secondary data is carried out to support the data processing process in the form 
of determining the required area using space requirement tools, determining the new rental warehouse using the 
Analytical Hierarchy Process Method, and designing the rental warehouse layout using the ABC Analysis Method 
and Office Layout Technique. After processing the data, an analysis can be carried out from the calculation of the

4. Conclusions and Suggestions 
Based on the processed data, here are the conclusions of this study. 
1. Determination is determined based on the dimensions of pallets of each size and the number of requests on average 
for 3 months. In addition, the calculation is also determined from the distance between the forklift maneuvers and 
the distance between the bulkhead and aisle. The results of the calculation for the required area of at least 3,717 
m2. 
2. The determination is made by identifying the criteria that support the achievement of the company's goals for 
renting a warehouse. An alternative to the calculation results of the AHP Method is the location of PT. XYZ 
which is located at Jl. Daan Mogot Km 21 with a percentage of 43.7%. 
3. The design is based on the ABC Analysis Method and the Office Layout Technique Method. The results of the 
analysis using the ABC Analysis Method are the sorting of flooring products based on classes A, B, and C. The 
results obtained from 11 ceramic and granite products are 5 class A products, 2 class B products, and 4 class C 
products. will be placed in locations close to entrances and exits, class B products will be placed behind class A 
products, and class C products will be placed at the back end of class A and C products. Office Layout Technique 
method in designing office layouts with the need for an office area of 71.19 and the determination of a circulation 
zone with a distance between desks and desks in the Receiving division room of 0.7 m and a contactless zone 
with a hallway width in the warehouse head's office of 0.47 m. Then to be able to know the width of the table 
base and the distance from the table to the chair, the dimensions of the human body are used with dimensions of 
24 based on the width of the table base using P50 and dimensions 13 with P95. 
 
Based on the processed data, here are suggestions that can be considered for PT. XYZ. 
1. Research can be used as a reference for renting a warehouse, especially alternatives obtained from the AHP 
method, namely the location of PT. XYZ is located on Jl. Daan Mogot Km 21. 
2. If the company is going to rent a warehouse, it is necessary to consider the trend of each product by distributing 
service quality questionnaires to the products sold by the Depo Bangunan Supermarket. Therefore, the company 
can carry out a marketing strategy for the next 6 months and evaluate the warehouse capacity needed to achieve 
these targets.

Abstract 
Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice structures have been identified as the most promising design structure 
for biomedical implants due to their controllable mechanical properties and porous architecture. Selective laser 
melting (SLM) is a state-of-art additive manufacturing (AM) technology that has enabled the manufacturing of 
complex geometries with customized designs. In this research work, two types of TPMS lattice structures viz. Gyroid 
and Diamond were designed and manufactured by the SLM process using SS316L material. This study evaluates the 
surface roughness, and dimensional accuracy of SLM-printed parts of SS316L TPMS lattice structures (Schoen 
gyroids and Schwartz diamond). The dimensional accuracy of as-built parts was investigated by performing a density 
test. A laser scanner was used to scan the SLM-printed gyroid and diamond lattice structure samples in order to study 
the deviations from the original CAD model. Surface roughness is measured at three different locations: the inner 
surface, the top surface, and the side surface. It was found that the average values of the Ra are 14.2µm, 13.1 µm, and 
12 µm at respective surfaces for gyroid lattice structure and 13.4 µm, 12.5 µm, and 12.2 µm for diamond lattice 
structure. It was found that the inner surface roughness values of both the lattice structures fall in the range of 10 to 
20 µm. This range was suggested by the literature for better bone-tissue interaction. From the experimentation, it was 
also found that the surface roughness of the gyroid lattice structure is comparatively higher than the diamond lattice 
structure. The lattice structure’s density was found at 7.62  g/cc for gyroid and 7.66 g/cc for diamond lattice structure, 
while the relative density of diamond structures was found to be 98.46% and 98.20% for gyroid structure. Finally, 
through this experimentation it was found that the SLM-built diamond lattice structure shows high accuracy compared 
to the gyroid lattice structure.

Abstract 
Comfort is the new in! Consumers of the apparel industry today demand of soft and breathable fabrics which are 
suitable to wear on casual outings as well as at certain family functions or parties. Designers across the world are 
coming up with innovative designs on such fabrics which are comfortable to wear and which the consumer feels 
confident to wear on ceremonial occasions. This change of events is a golden opportunity for the players in Indian 
Handicrafts Industry operating in the category of textiles. The manufacturers in the Chikankari industry are taking 
advantage of this scenario and taking steps to create such products which satisfy the needs of the consumers while 
also keeping the essence of the craft alive. This research paper aims to study the attitude of consumers towards the 
acceptance of Chikankari products as occasion wear.

Abstract 
Importance– performance analysis (IPA) is a popular tool used for customer satisfaction management and retention 
of customers. Based on the IPA results, companies can prioritize the service attributes to enhance the service quality 
and customer loyalty. However, the conventional IPA treats the customers  as a homogenous group, which may affect 
the result validity. In this study, IPA is proposed along with Density-based spatial clustering of application with noise 
(DBSCAN) and Back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for customer segmentation to overcome the limitations of 
the conventional IPA. A case study of a telecommunication company in Vietnam is presented to demonstrate the 
implementation and application of the proposed framework.

1. Introduction
Retaining customers is an important strategy for sustainable business growth. Numerous experimental studies have 
confirmed the positive relationship between customer satisfaction, customer retention, and company profitability 
(Anderson et al. 1994; Lambert 1998). To meet different expectations of customers,  importance–performance analysis 
(IPA) and customer segmentation are two common techniques that help  companies utilize resources judiciously. The 
IPA assists managers in determining which attributes need priority of improvement based on the perception of 
customers on the attribute performance and the attribute importance (Matzler et al. 2004; Martilla and James 1977). 
On the other hand, employing clustering techniques helps companies to segment customers based on their  thinking 
and purchasing habits and so tailor their services or products to the target segments (Tripathi et al. 2018; Zeithaml et 
al. 2001).

5.3.2. Strategies for individual cluster 
Some attributes are evaluated differently among the three groups of users based on their specific characteristics of 
demography and behavior.  For instance, for cluster I, managers should mainly focus on (13) frequency of promotion, 
(15) billing accuracy, and (23) ease of contacting the company. For cluster II, managers should concentrate on the
attribute (12) convenience in use of value-added services. For cluster III, managers should focus on (1) Network
coverage and willingness and friendliness of employees.
5.3.3. Comparison with conventional BPNN-based IPA approach 
The conventional BPNN-based IPA matrix (Hosseini & Bideh, 2014, Figure 5(d)) is developed to compare with our 
devised model which employs DBSCAN- BPNN – IPA. Some inconsistencies are found when comparing Figure 5(d) 
and Figure 5(a,b,c). For example, quadrant 2 in  the conventional BPNN-based IPA matrix (Figure 5(d)) includes the 
service attributes (2), (4), (13), (14), (15), (21), and (22),which requires “concentrate” while  attributes numbered (2), 
(13), (15) are not an improvement priority for users in cluster II (Figure 5(b)). Other inconsistencies are found in 
quadrant 3 – the “possible kill”, which lie attributes (3), (7), (8), (17) (Figure 5(d)), but attributes (3),(7) and (17) are 
in quadrant 1  of cluster 1 (Figure 5(a). 
6. Conclusion
This paper illustrates a combination of different techniques DBSCAN clustering – BPNN – IPA to improve the 
managerial strategies of companies for different market clusters, which helps to retain the company’s existing 
customers.  The combined techniques is supposed to overcome major drawbacks of the conventional IPA. A case 
study of mobile broadband service users of VinaPhone network in Vietnam is presented to demonstrate the 
implementation and application of the proposed framework. For future studies, we recommend a new model with 
larger sample size and more characteristics of the customers to increase the reliability and applicability of the model.

Abstract 
Having a company is not only able to generate high profits but also able to survive in any conditions. The strength of 
a company to be able to have a sustainable company is to carry out financial management optimally in the company's 
operational processes. The purpose of this study was to examine and analyze the effect of liquidity, profitability, and 
firm size on the capital structure of 26 companies from the results of sample selection using the purposive sampling 
method on infrastructure, transportation, and utilities listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2020. The 
analytical method used in this research is multiple linear regression. The results of this study indicate that liquidity 
(CR), profitability (ROA) and firm size simultaneously and partially affect the capital structure (DER). Companies 
with effective capital management show that in conditions of profit, the company will use its capital to finance its 
obligations. The results of this study are following the pecking order theory. The more a company can meet the needs 
of its company, the financial condition is considered to survive and be sustainable and create prosperity.

1. Introduction
The most basic thing that needs to be ascertained to develop a business is how much capital the business owners have. 
ADB (2017) state that with the size of the amount of capital owned, the company prepares what is needed to start 
operations or can also plan to expand its business. The relationship between capital and company performance 
encourages companies to optimally manage the company's assets and liabilities. Transportation, electricity, 
telecommunications, and water supply and sanitation is the type of infrastructure that critical to development. 
Infrastructure plays an important role in the production of goods and services to increase productivity, which means 
encouraging opportunities to trade, generate innovation and help discover new products, processes, and markets.ADB 
(2017); Duffield, Peng and Wilson (2019) said that with a population that continues to grow and increase, urbanization, 
as well as global climate change, the demand for infrastructure development is increasing. Inefficiency and high costs 
arising from poor connectivity present a major limitation good for the development of many industries and for 
attracting foreign investment.  The emergence of innovation as an important part of sustainability has a role in 
economic and infrastructure development. The existence of global issues related to climate change, pollution, and 
other environmental factors requires a direction of achievement that is no longer only talking about the economy but 
also the sustainability of the earth as part of humans themselves. In ADB (2020) explain that infrastructure is also a 
key driver for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a 
global action plan agreed by world leaders, including Indonesia, reducing protection, and protecting the environment. 
One of the most significant and pressing issues for Indonesia is how the state will finance, finance, and provide the 
infrastructure needed to support economic growth and reform strategies for the country (Duffield, Peng and Wilson, 
2019). The state cannot walk alone in realizing good infrastructure for the community, it is necessary for the private 
sector to jointly build infrastructure in Indonesia. This is also an opportunity for the private sector to gain profits 
because Indonesia is in the process of achieving economic sustainability supported by infrastructure as a social nexus. 
Companies engaged in the infrastructure sector, one of which, requires a certain amount of capital for large operational

(2020), Suharsono and Setiadi (2020), but not in line with the result by Seftianne and Handayani (2011), Kaliman and 
Wibowo (2017). 
 
In hypothesis 3 the significance value < the conditional value (0.05) is 0.000 < 0.05, it can be concluded that H3 is 
accepted, so Size has a significant and positive effect on capital structure. Large-scale companies have easy access to 
funding in the form of loans. With the company's large needs, the company prefers to fund externally rather than issue 
new shares. The decision to make funding in the form of long-term loans will increase debt and affect the capital 
structure. Particularly, infrastructure, transportation, and utility companies in their operational activities based on 
tenders or contracts with a gradual or terminated funding system require large funds at the beginning to be able to 
quickly complete their projects. For this reason, external financing is needed, both in the form of debt securities 
financing and financial services financing. With a large company size, the lender will see the value of the company's 
assets as collateral to protect the funder from the risk of default. The larger the size of the company as measured by 
total assets, it will affect the company's capital structure where companies with large assets will tend to seek funds 
from debt securities or financing financial services. This is still in line with the pecking order theory which shows that 
there is a funding sequence if the company has insufficient capital to finance the company's needs. The results of this 
study are in line with the research of Liang and Natsir (2019), Nguyen and Tran (2020), Seftianne and Handayani 
(2011), Suharsono and Setiadi (2020), but not in line with the results of research by Joni and Lina (2010). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the study, it was concluded that liquidity profitability and size had a significant effect on the 
capital structure of the infrastructure, transportation and utility sector companies listed on the IDX from 2018 to 2020. 
Because the results of this study indicate that there is a significant effect of profitability, liquidity and size on capital 
structure, it is hoped that companies engaged in infrastructure, transportation and utilities, can optimize the company's 
profitability, the company must be able to maximize all its wealth for operating activities in order to generate the 
highest profit and prevent companies from using debt. Companies that use their own capital in company activities 
mean the company is to pay all its own expenses. Controlling the fulfillment of short-term obligations on time to 
control the collection receivable from customer, controlling cash availability for short term payments and optimizing 
the use of assets to generate profits will show that the company's management of capital is effective. Infrastructure, 
transportation, and utility companies require strong fund management considering that the payment system from the 
customer depends on the settlement period. If the infrastructure company experiences an error in calculating costs in 
carrying out the project, the company needs to be mentally prepared to wait for the next payment. The risk of capital 
if company do not have a strong capability to pay will affect the company's performance and ultimately to the 
company's reputation. Costs need to be considered in determining the use of debt. In the end, with the use of debt that 
is greater than the benefits and in bad economic conditions, the company will not last long because it has to pay interest 
and principal payments on the loan. This research takes an observation period of 2018-2020, in which 2020 the 
emergence of Covid conditions that have an impact on the economy that is not profitable for business.  
 
The existence of investor confidence in the size of the company, namely the larger the size of the company is expected 
to be able to manage assets optimally to obtain stable profits. The level of assets considered to guarantee for investors 
in the event of liquidity, investors can obtain funds for the funds obtained. But investors expect the company to have 
a long life in earning profits in difficult conditions such as the Covid-19, some infrastructures company survive and 
able to fulfill their obligations to stakeholders. The strength of a company able to create the sustainable company 
condition and to carry out financial management to the maximum extent possible in the company's operational 
processes with controlling the capital structure.  
 
In this study, contras with the theory that it can be seen that in 14 of the 26 companies with a DER level above 100%, 
which means the higher the DER, the worse the company is because the risk of the company is getting bigger, but the 
company is able to generate profitability during Covid-19 in 2020. This shows that if a company with high profitability 
will affect the capital structure in which the company chooses to obtain debt, it becomes a funding tool that can 
encourage the company to survive in difficult situations provided that the company has the ability to pay so that it can 
avoid default in difficult times. If the company chooses to obtain funding to increase revenue, the company must be 
able to manage the use of debt efficiently so that the company can obtain a cost of capital or other types of debt with

risk. Make sure the benefits are greater than debt financing and if the cost of debt is greater than the company is 
advised not to add debt. 
 
The suggestions to be conveyed from the results of this study are also provide advice for the government. If the 
government wants to accelerate infrastructure development in Indonesia, there is cooperation with private sector 
companies. The form of cooperation can be in the form of a cooperation agreement or the provision of credit facilities 
that can support the sector, especially during this pandemic. One of the problems in this sector is the lack of profit 
generated so that government assistance is needed so that this sector can move and have business sustainability. For 
further researchers using a cash flow ratio variable using the cash flow generated during the reporting period compared 
to the current ratio at a certain time. In addition, the researcher uses a liquidity proxy variable with a current ratio 
proxy, while the infrastructure sector needs to look at its long-term obligations and cash flow in fulfil their obligations.

Abstract 
The role of the supply chain is very important in the company's material flow process, starting from the delivery of 
raw materials by suppliers to the finished product in the form of apartment units into the hands of consumers. 
Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an analysis to measure and assess the extent to which the supply chain 
performance and the company's productivity level have been achieved so that it can provide suggestions for 
improvements to the company's performance indicators which are still below the target. This measurement is based 
on five core processes in the SCOR method and then weighted to each core process, work attributes, and each KPI 
using the AHP method, as well as a scoring system using OMAX and Traffic Light System analysis. The overall 
value of the company's supply chain performance achievement is 8,063, it is concluded that five supply chain 
performance indicators need to immediately take corrective action because they are still in the yellow level and are 
expected to help improve the company's supply chain performance.

1. Introduction
The evolutionary development of the theory of logistics led to the emergence of a new logistic concept – Supply 
Chain Management at the end of the 20th century. Today, most researcher agree on the basic definition of a supply 
chain: “A supply chain is defined as a set of three or more entities (organizations or individuals) directly involved in 
the upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, and/or information from a to a customer, (and 
return)” (Mukhamedjanova, 2020). To find out the implementation of the supply chain for the procurement of goods 
and services can be declared running well or not, it is necessary to review the effectiveness of supply chain activities 
in procuring goods and services by using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) method. With the 
application of the SCOR method, the identification of supply chain work indicators can be assessed to what extent a 
company can fulfill a job, calculate the achievement of targets or the application of predetermined standards so that 
the company's performance is expected to be carried out effectively in accordance with company standards 
(Bolstorff and Rosenbaum, 2007). One way to achieve good indicators in assessing a problem is to use Key 
Performance Indicator (KPI). KPI compares what has been created with what has been set. Successful 
implementation is dependent on implementing a good maintenance strategy according to what has been established 
(Parmenter 2015). In addition, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method can be used as a tool to analyze decisions. 
In recent years, in a world of rapidly growing complexity, making the best decisions is an increasingly demanding 
task for corporate managers, government agencies, and many other decision and policy makers. Many methods 
derived from applied mathematical techniques and operations research have proven useful to help decision makers 
to make the right decisions (Brunelli, 2015). Moreover, one of the methods used to measure productivity in 
manufacturing companies is the Objective Matrix (OMAX) method. OMAX is a performance measurement method 
that evaluates several productivity criteria based on weights to obtain a company's overall productivity index. The 
use of the OMAX method can produce effective resources (Balkan, 2011). 
The study taken on a real-estate company in Indonesia (PT. Sunny Garden Property) that began to experience a 
decline in production due to the actual difference in production activities with the targets to be achieved by the 
company in the last semester. This causes the productivity level of all supply chain activities to decrease. Initial

according to demand patterns so that companies can adjust between inventory held with inventory forecasting 
results.  
The results of the calculation of OMAX KPI C11, namely ""handling defective work on site"" and KPI C12, namely 
""employee performance"" positioned at level 7 due to lack of quality and potential development of human resources 
(HR) involved in development projects. HR does not have much knowledge in building construction in accordance 
with the company's standard operating procedure (SOP) so that repeated production errors often occur. The 
recommended solution is to improve the quality of workers and products produced by establishing and applying 
SOP correctly in the field. The addition of new production machines could be applied so that the quality of 
production is more consistent as well as providing training and awards to workers to increase work motivation. The 
feasibility survey and handling of defective work on the site can be distributed to consumers so that the company 
gets valid data to be reviewed for future improvements. 
6. Conclusion
The identification of the company's performance level was compiled based on a questionnaire and brainstorming, 
then by grouping the supply chain activities based on SCOR model approach; the first stage is the identification and 
weighting of the five core SCOR processes, namely plan, source, make, deliver, and return; the second stage is the 
identification and measurement of the work attributes of the SCOR dimensions which are divided into three namely 
reliability, responsiveness, and agility; and the third stage is the design and determination of the weights of 21 KPI 
which are all supply chain activities on the company.  
The results of the calculation of supply chain performance are based on OMAX and Traffic Light System method is 
8,063 it is concluded that overall supply chain activities on the company is considered good but there are still KPIs 
that are still at the yellow level that need corrective action, which is KPI A11, A21, A22, C11, and C22.

Abstract 
In 2020 there was a COVID-19 pandemic which caused economic turmoil to all industrial sectors and in this study 
focused on the construction sector, where the impact of the pandemic also affected the business performance of PT. 
Citatah, a company that produces and sells marble, where the company experienced a significant decrease in net profit. 
It was found that the seven elements of the 7P marketing mix had a significant effect on increasing sales if they were 
carried out simultaneously based on the results of the F-test and T-test. The results of the study concluded the two 
elements that gave the most significant influence were product and process elements. Based on the BCG matrix 
approach to get a product portfolio strategy, the company will allocate a budget for products with low-end 
segmentation where low-end products are included in the Star quadrant where this quadrant shows products in 
improving market conditions and profitability. The results of the calculation using the SWOT method, obtained all 
internal and external aspects of the company, then it was found that the company is in the progressive quadrant so that 
this triggers the company to execute opportunities and each strategy formulation is correlated back to the elements of 
the strategy mix that have a significant influence on increasing sales.

1. Introduction
During the Coronavirus emergency, there have been central changes in clients' requests and buy conduct, which makes 
it substantially more critical for a firm to depend on enhancing its showcasing practices and procedures for endurance. 
Realizing that clients change their way of behaving during an emergency, for example, the Coronavirus pandemic, 
promoting chiefs shouldn't trust that things will fully recover and take on a ""no-activity"" demeanor as it will place the 
firm in a more tough spot. (Nikbin, et.al., 2021). Strategy plays an important role so that business actors can maintain, 
process, and innovate the existence of their natural potential, in Indonesia currently marble crafts are developed and 
produce products that have a high selling value (Haerani, et.al., 2019). The development of the global economy is 
currently developing with an open trade system so that this has an impact on the Indonesian state, especially for every 
business actor where global trade like this will affect increasingly fierce business competition, both between domestic 
and international business actors. Along with these developments, the marble sector business also experienced a 
significant shift (Astuti, et.al., 2019). 
PT. Citatah Tbk is a company engaged in the marble industry where marble is a finishing material that is relatively 
expensive compared to granite or ceramics, but this finishing material is quite popular among the public. Marble as a 
supporting material and correlates with the construction sector in Indonesia such as housing projects, hotels, and 
condominiums. During the current pandemic, the construction sector is experiencing a decline, according to the 
Indonesian National Construction Entrepreneurs Association (GAPENSI) noting that business performance in the 
construction sector has declined due to the many delays in construction projects during the pandemic. According to 
statistical results released by the Central Statistics Agency regarding Indonesia's economic growth in Quarter I-2021, 
the Indonesian economy in the first quarter of 2021 against the first quarter of 2020 experienced a growth contraction 
of 0.74% year-on-year (YoY) and Indonesia's economic growth in Quarter I-2021 compared to quarter IV-2020 
experienced a growth contraction of 0.96% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) but with the economic growth that occurred it 
did not have an impact on all business sectors where the construction business sector was still experiencing a

Figure 6. PT Citatah position of BCG Matrix result 
 
 
The coordinates show the company's position in the competition where PT (Figure 6). Citatah is in quadrant I 
(Progressive), this condition is a very favorable situation where the company has opportunities and strengths so that 
the company can take advantage of the opportunities it has which is supported by its strengths.  
 
5.2.5 Discussion Result 
Based on the results of processing the SWOT matrix, it was found that PT. Citatah is in quadrant one with coordinates 
(0.126; 0.081) where the strategy applied is a progressive strategy and is based on the relationship with the 7P 
marketing mix elements where there are 2 most influential elements in increasing sales so that all strategies from 
SWOT analysis will refer to these two elements as well as From the calculation of the BCG matrix, it is found that the 
product segmentation that is still increasing is the product in the low-end segment so that these three variables will be 
formulated in several strategies including: 
1. Controlling marble waste and implementing green products by serving as affordable furniture products (S4, S5, S9, 
O2, O3, O4) 
2. Develop a BIM system for the entire process where the company has a factory that implements industry 4.0 (S2, 
S3, S4, S7, O5) 
3. Develop the supply chain process by looking for any bottlenecks that occur during production to reduce the lead 
time of the production process to increase the potential for collaboration both domestically and internationally (W1, 
W5, O1) 
4. Controlling existing marble waste and creating products with much lower prices to work on the MSME craftsman 
market (W4, O2, O4) 
All strategies are prepared based on current conditions where in the 7P marketing mix elements, the 2 elements that 
most influence the increase in sales are Product and Process so that all strategies resulting from SWOT Analysis refer 
to these two components and refer to the BCG method where the segment that is experiencing growth is the middle-
low segment. 
 
6. Conclusion

Based on the results of the F-Test, it is found that for the free elements Product (X1), Price (X2), Place (X3), Promotion 
(X4), People (X5), Process (X6), and Physical Evidence (X7) have a significant effect on significant increase in sales 
where the calculated F value > F Table (283,236 > 2.13) and for the T-Test test for each independent element there 
are only two elements that significantly affect the increase in sales where the two elements are Price (X1) and Process 
(X6) so it can be concluded that when testing the F-Test all independent elements if run simultaneously will 
significantly increase sales, but if run partially there are only two independent elements that significantly affect sales 
increase. Based on the BCG matrix approach, it is found that the low-end product segmentation (marble and granite) 
has a Relative Market Share of 1.041 and a Market Growth Rate of 0.53% so that the budget allocation will be focused 
to the low-end product segment, this is because the market share provided by the low-end product segment is 62.11% 
of the company's total net sales. Based on the SWOT analysis carried out and combining the methods with the 7P 
marketing mix and BCG matrix BCG, the strategies that will be proposed are as follows: 
Controlling marble waste and implementing green products by serving as affordable furniture products (S4, S5, S9, 
O2, O3, O4). Develop a BIM system for all processes where the company has a factory that implements industry 4.0 
(S2, S3, S4, S7, O5). Develop supply chain processes by looking for any bottlenecks that occur during production to 
reduce the lead time of the production process to increase the potential for collaboration both domestically and 
internationally (W1, W5, O1). Controlling existing marble waste and creating products with much lower prices to 
work on the MSME craftsman market (W4, O2, O4). The proposed strategy is based on three methods that have been 
carried out, namely: testing the level of influence of the 7P marketing mix, product portfolio with BCG matrix and 
SWOT analysis as a reference for making strategic decisions which based on the results shown, the company is in the 
Progressive quadrant so the company must take an action to execute their opportunity.

Abstract 
This paper presents the results of a research questionnaire of building occupants in selected commercial and office 
buildings in Hyderabad. A total of 614 building occupants participated in the study from selected 28 commercial and 
office buildings. Many researchers have used questionnaire as an effective tool to measure the comfort of building 
occupants. Hence, teams were formed for conducting the questionnaire survey in different buildings. The occupants 
were explained the purpose of the study and asked to give their feedback on the form. The data was collected and 
analyzed to know their level of satisfaction with the building environment. Results show that the participants were 
mainly young males who spend a considerable time indoors. HVAC system is operational for most part of the year 
in those buildings. Some occupants have reported health issues like nasal irritation, headache, throat irritation, dry 
mouth, and drowsiness. These symptoms were related to their health history or seasonal effects besides air-
conditioning issues. A majority of occupants have expressed their satisfaction with the building environments and 
all its environmental parameters. However, a small percentage of respondents have expressed dissatisfaction also 
which could be related to their individual backgrounds, medical issues, workloads, and attitudes. However, cigarette 
smoking remains an issue in commercial buildings.

1. Introduction
With the growth of economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many new commercial and office buildings were 
constructed in India that are completely air-tight and indoor environment is controlled by Heating, Ventilation, and 
Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems. The air supplied in these buildings comes only through the HVAC system. 
Hence, there is a need to assess the quality of air inside these buildings, as people spend a lot of time indoors and 
their wellbeing depends on the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).

Figure 6. This may be due to the weather conditions of Hyderabad, India, which is usually hot and warm for about 6 
to 8 months and the remaining part of the year is pleasant. 
 
About 8 percent of the surveyed occupants have complained that these systems provide either too hot or cold air to 
the spaces. Reasons for this complaint include direct throw of air from the supply diffuser, or position near the return 
grilles, or poor distribution of air. Almost 53 percent of the occupants have indicated that the maintenance of these 
systems is carried out once a year in their buildings while 18 percent reported that it is done once in two years as 
shown in Figure 6. However, some occupants were found to be ignorant on this issue (Figure 6).

4.4 General Information 
About 72 percent of the respondents were young males and 66 percent of surveyed occupants were less than 40 
years of age. It is important to mention here about their age and sex as these factors have an influence on the 
perception of comfort conditions (Collett, 1993). Almost 91 percent of the respondents spend more than 6 hours 
inside the investigated buildings. Since they spend considerable time inside buildings, it gives credibility to the 
collected data as a true picture of indoor conditions. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Research questionnaire of building occupants is an effective tool for getting the feedback about the perception of 
spaces in which people spend a considerable time. A total of 614 building occupants participated in the study from 
28 commercial and office buildings. 72% of these respondents were males and 28% females, 66% were below 40 
years of age. 91% of these occupants spend more than 6 hours inside buildings.  
 
15% respondents reported that the HVAC systems are operational throughout the year, while 54% reported it to be 
functional for about 9 months a year. 53% reported that annual maintenance is carried out for HVAC. 
 
When asked about the health related issues, 19% reported nasal irritation, 17% headache, 16% throat irritation, 15% 
dry mouth, and 14% drowsiness. Most of the complaints have been reported during evening time and summer 
periods which implies that the symptoms may be related to season. 25% respondents have a history of various 
allergies. 
 
About 86% occupants have expressed their comfort with the indoor environment space. In response to their comfort 
levels with the environmental parameters, 88% are thermally comfortable, 79% are comfortable with the humidity 
levels, 76% are acoustically comfortable, 89% are comfortable with lighting levels, 89% perceive the air to be clean, 
almost 94% feel the movement as either still or moderate, and 67%of respondents did not notice any odour. 
 
Hence, the majority of the building occupants were observed to be satisfied with the environmental conditions in 
their indoor spaces to a larger extent. A small percentage of dissatisfaction cannot be ruled out in any building, 
which depends on a number of factors like the background of respondents, medical history, workloads, and attitude. 
35% respondents indicated that some people smoke in the surroundings and there are no separate smoking zones. 
This problem is of concern in commercial buildings rather than office buildings.

Abstract 
Recording attendance and managing work is an issue faced by almost all workers, especially those working from 
outside the office. This problem should be overcome by taking advantage of current technological advances, one of 
which is the use of mobile-based applications. The purpose of this article is to propose an attendance application to 
help employees in the attendance taking and task management process. The development process starts with a 
comprehensive questionnaire to address the user requirements, then combined by similar application analysis. The 
problems that were identified were then assessed to create a list of features. It is hoped that this application can help 
employees to focus less on the attendance and task management, and more towards improved productivity.

Attendance Taking, Task Management and mobile Application 
1. Introduction
Rapid technological advances in all aspects of life have an impact on the many human activities that are easier and 
faster to complete. One of them is in the world of work. Currently, many companies have taken advantage of advances 
in technology to cut business processes so that the desired output is more effective. For example, a company in the 
field of E-Commerce, this company helps merchants to sell their wares to buyers without having to face to face. 
According to Istijanto (2012), the definition of absenteeism is the absence of an employee when the employee is 
scheduled to work. The number of absences from work in the company illustrates the exchange of benefits between 
employees and companies that pay. Of course, companies do not want to lose due to high employee absences. 
Frequency is the total number of absences in a year, regardless of the length of time. Short-term absence is the number 
of absences for 1-2 workdays during the year. Meanwhile, frequency is the total number of absences in a year, 
regardless of the length of time. Absence in the short term is the number of absences of 1-2 working days during a 
year. This causes absences to greatly affect the performance of the personal and the institution where he works, which 
can be used as advanced considerations and decision-making for the continued development of the agency. 
Therefore, the attendance system is very important in knowing the presence of employees in a company. The 
development of the attendance system has now developed with supporting technology such as computers and gadgets. 
From attendance systems that use paper, computer programs, fingerprints, eye scans, and now many have switched to 
using mobile-based applications. With the existence of so many smartphones, several companies can update their

Admin Function 
Figure 9. Add Employee 
This application has 3 types of users who have different powers (Figure 9). First of all employees, this user has access 
to the main features. Both supervisors, just like employees, can access all the main features of the application. What 
distinguishes between these two users is that supervisors can add tasks, approve leave requests, and approve tasks. 
The third admin, this user access can only add, edit, and delete employee data. Especially for admin, the feature can 
only be accessed using the web. 
In the use of mobile applications developed by users, they are required to have a smartphone-based on the Android or 
iOS operating system with an available memory specification of 50 MB and have a minimum RAM capacity of 2 GB 
and an internet connection. Meanwhile, to use a web application developed by a user, it is enough to have a web 
browser. 
6. Conclusion
From the results of data collection regarding similar applications, many applications have not met the needs of 
employees, such as the absence of a leave application feature and task management, even though these features are 
critical according to the survey conducted by the authors. Data collection is performed using the questionnaire 
distribution method in the hope that it can get useful input from employees so that the authors can design and develop 
applications as needed and can assist employees in carrying out their work. After designing and developing this 
application, a prototype has been designed to be developed and implemented in the future, and the solution is deemed 
feasible for implementation and should also have significant value for the users. 
7. Future Works
There are several future works that can be done as a follow up to this research. Firstly, the development of this 
application should be done, and preferably using a multi-platform approach, meaning the application should be 
developed for Android and iOS. Suggested framework to enable this development is Flutter. Secondly, there are 
several features that might be beneficial to improve the value for this prototype, which are: (1) virtual meeting room, 
(2) salary management, and (3) medical benefit claim.

Abstract  
Ergonomics is concerned with the analysis of several work-related factors that may be a potential risk for developing 
musculoskeletal disorders, and development of solutions to eliminate or reduce such risks. The present study aims to 
identify ergonomic risk factors and analysis of postures in an electrical distribution transformer manufacturing 
industry in Karnataka. Some of the major activities in transformer manufacturing are core building, coil winding, 
drying in oven, final assembly and manufacturing of tanks. The manufacturing activities are characterized by 
repetitive actions, forceful, or prolonged exertion of the hands, heavy lifting and carrying of heavy objects; and 
prolonged awkward postures.  The industry employs about 150 workers and 60 workers were selected for the study. 
A sample of 36 workers from various sections is selected for study. The mean age is 31.41 ± 8.17 year and average 
experience 9.26 ± 5.91 year. The Body Mass Index (BMI) indicated 75% workers are normal and only 8% are 
overweight. A MSD questionnaire was used to determine the prevalence of MSDs and ergonomic assessment tools 
RULA and REBA were used for postural analysis. The self reported MSD questionnaire shows discomfort in lower 
back (86%), upper back (55%0, wrists/hands (61%0 and shoulder (58%). The results of RULA and REBA revealed 
about 40% and 47% postures in high risk category. Few selected postures are analyzed using CATIA software and 
recommended improvements are shown which results in reducing the risks of postures. To reduce the risk factors 
several ergonomic interventions were recommended like redesign of work stations to reduce awkward postures, and 
risks of manual handling. Use of personnel protective equipment is also recommended and awareness and training 
the workers about ergonomic principles may result in improved health, environment and productivity.

Abstract 
Road accidents due to distracted driving have been on a rise in recent years. As per the Road Accident Report 
2019, 11 people were killed each hour in India due to road accidents (Transport Research Wing, 2020). This 
makes it crucial to take measures to stop the number of road fatalities. It found that the major cause of these 
accidents was driver error. This paper proposed a solution to detect the distraction of drivers into different 
predefined classes. The use of different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models viz. AlexNet, 
VGG16, and ResNet50, for the classification of distracted drivers according to the State Farm’s Distracted Driver 
Detection challenge on Kaggle, are depicted in this paper, As well as MyModel is trained on Dataset consisting 
of different local driver’s 2D dashboard camera images along with the State Farm’s Dataset. After comparing the 
results of predefined models with MyModel, the best result has been found as a categorical cross-entropy loss of 
0.2344 on the validation set and an accuracy score of 93.28%.

1. Introduction
Road Accidents are one of the leading causes of death, disability, and hospitalization of people worldwide in 
general and Indian particular. At least one out of 10 people killed on roads across the world is from India, 
according to the World Health Organization. As per the Report on ‘Road accidents in India 2019’, the accident-
related deaths in India in 2019 were 1,51,113 in number and 451,361 injuries (Transport Research Wing, 2020). 
In this report, it is found that the major cause of accidents was ‘Distracted Drivers Behavior’, which includes 
major use of mobile phones while driving, eating, drinking, talking with nearby passengers, reaching behind, 
fixing hair, etc. To mitigate this problem, we classified driver’s behavior into 10 different classes.  
We input images of the driver into our model. Each image belongs to one of the 10 classes mentioned in the 
dataset section. The model then predicts the class of an image by giving an output as the probability for each class. 
If the software is integrated with the hardware, we can warn the driver if he’s distracted or not, thus preventing 
accidents from happening. This paper compares the results of pre-trained models with MyModel made from 
scratch based on the categorical cross-entropy loss and Accuracy as a metric. 
1.1 Related work 
This challenge was hosted on the Kaggle platform by Statefarm Insurance company USA in 2016. Some recent 
works combine multiple models for distracted driver detection which include wearable sensors to measure 
physiological and biomedical signals such as brain activity, muscular activity, and heart rate. Due to the 
involvement of personnel and the cost of hardware this method failed (Fernández et al., 2016). Thereafter some 
solutions were based on the SVM model that detects the use of mobile phones while driving (Abouelnaga et al., 
2018). The traditional methods use handcrafted features, specifically HOG and clustered SIFT descriptors using 
Bag of Words (BOW) passed into a tuned SVM classifier (Hssayeni et al., 2017). Some used hand and face

To evaluate the performance of models categorical cross-entropy or log loss was used as the metrics. Here N 
stands for a number of predictions and M is the number of classes i.e., 10 in our case. The value of yij is 1 if the 
image i belong to class j with the probability value of pij. 
As per the objective we prepared models, based on the comparative study table 1. we compared results based on 
training and validation loss we found that,  
1. AlexNet has more training loss than MyModel’s training loss, thus MyModel performs better than 
AlexNet in training. 
2. VGG-16 has low training loss than MyModel’s training loss, hence VGG-16 performs better than 
MyModel in training. 
3. ResNet-50 has more training loss than MyModel’s training loss, hence MyModel is far better than 
ResNet-50 in training. 
4. AlexNet has more validation loss than MyModel’s validation loss, thus MyModel performs better than 
AlexNet in validation.  
5. VGG-16 has more validation loss than MyModel’s validation loss, hence MyModel performs better than 
VGG-16 in validation.  
6. ResNet-50 has more validation loss than MyModel’s validation loss, hence MyModel is far better than 
ResNet-50 in validation too.

Likewise, from a comparative study in table 1. we compared results based on training and validation accuracy we 
found that, 
1. AlexNet has less training accuracy than MyModel’s training accuracy, thus MyModel performs better 
than AlexNet in training.  
2. VGG-16 has more training accuracy than MyModel’s training accuracy, hence VGG-16 performs better 
than MyModel in training.  
3. ResNet-50 has less training accuracy than MyModel’s training accuracy, hence MyModel is far better 
than ResNet-50 in training. 
4. AlexNet has less validation accuracy than MyModel’s validation accuracy, thus MyModel performs 
better than AlexNet in validation. 
5. VGG-16 has less validation accuracy than MyModel’s validation accuracy, hence MyModel performs 
better than VGG-16 in validation. 
6. ResNet-50 has less validation accuracy than MyModel’s validation accuracy, hence MyModel is far 
better than ResNet-50 in validation too. 
 
6. Conclusion  
We compared three well-known CNN models with our model for the distracted driver detection and classification 
problem. After trying out several CNN models, MyModel’s Validation loss was 0.1295. We can conclude that 
MyModel performs far better in validation and training too. If we provide any random image from particular 10 
classes, it will give better prediction results. Furthermore, current deep CNN models can be used to automatically 
detect distracted drivers and can be integrated with different hardware systems to warn the driver. However, the 
main constraint for distracted driver detection using a dashboard camera from the driver’s viewpoint is the driver’s 
privacy. In the future, if CNN models can recognize distracted behaviors using images from a dashboard camera 
that captures the drivers from different angles in real-time, and combining distracted driver detection with drowsy 
driver detection using one classification model.

Abstract 
IoT (Internet of Things) is now a part of technology development. In utilizing the IoT technology, data aggregation 
can be applied. Data aggregation itself is a method that can help perform data processing in a system. Sensor 
technologies are widely used in health systems, in particular to help with health monitoring. A health system 
utilizing the technology of a smartwatch with sensors that can record body conditions and allow real-time data 
transmission can be developed with the help of several methods, one of which is data aggregation. To avoid data 
loss or lack in the midst of sending data packets, it is necessary to use a data aggregator as well as the cloud and 
an API to attract and send the data packets. The cloud is also a component that is quite important because it enables 
cloud computing as well as data storage. The data aggregator also helps reduce the transmission delay in sending 
data packets and compute the data that arrive from the sensors. Meanwhile, the API is widely used to carry out 
the process of transmitting data on an application or system, so it can be connected to a server or the cloud to 
manage data requests from a user to the server. It is also important to assess the source or resource used in the 
system, including the throughput or the amount of load that can be received by the resource.

1. Introduction
Health is an important aspect in life. In the past, to undergo health checks, we were required to come to the nearest 
health facility or hospital. However, with current technological developments, some companies have started to 
develop technologies that can be used daily to check the condition of the body with ease. The technological 
developments now have also seen the use of the Internet in combination with medical devices. Here is used what 
is referred to as IoT or Internet of Things. With IoT, all objects around us and our daily activities can be connected. 
It enables the performance of data collection, processing, monitoring, analysis, and control (Guth et al., 2018). 
To determine our health status, we can start from our sleep. It is necessary to find our sleep habits and assess the 
quality of our sleep in order to detect our health status. The better the quality of our sleep the better our health. 
Many studies assess the quality of sleep of an individual, and some do so using sensors. However, studies on sleep 
quality using wearable devices are still quite rare. Therefore, a new development is required to enrich research in 
this field, and this is where this study comes in. 
The use of the IoT technology can improve health services, particularly in monitoring health, fitness programs, 
diseases that are difficult to cure, and care for the elderly (Budida & Mangrulkar, 2018). As a new technological 
advancement, IoT is evolving into a smart system that can support and develop healthcare as well as biomedical-
related processes (Sivagami et al., 2016). The research by (Ara et al., 2017) explains that an aggregator can be in 
the form of a device such as an LPU or a smart device such as a smartphone. It can also be in the form of BDS. 
Another research work (Pantelopoulos & Bourbakis, 2010) describes the general architectures of wearable health-
monitoring systems (WHMS), following their functionality and system components. However, this should not be 
considered a standard system design as many systems can adopt a significant variety of architectural approaches.

Table 1 shows the total and average values from the tests carried out on the system. In the table above, it can be 
seen that the throughput values for the aggregator are quite high. Throughput is the value of the server's ability to 
control the amount of load from the server, and the higher the throughput value the better the performance of the 
server. Meanwhile, the response time value was smaller with the aggregator use. Shorter response time means 
that the server can process requests from users and provide feedback faster. 
The testing of throughput and response time can be influenced by several conditions, such as the Internet network 
and the specification of the server or device used in the test. Because the test requires a cloud service to 
accommodate data and a smartphone to serve as a data aggregator and because the sending of data involves an 
Internet network connection, if one of the research objects does not carry out its role properly, then the results of 
the research will be affected. 
Overall, the results prove whether the system made can run according to the design and show the throughput and 
response time values of the system. Throughput value is measured to assess the load of the server, and response 
time is measured to find out the time it takes to deal with a a request to the server. 
5. Conclusions and Future Works
From the results of the design and implementation of the sleep quality detection program, some conclusions can 
be drawn. The application created can display time data by pulling data following a request when the program is 
run, and the system will process the data. Meanwhile, the aggregator used can pull data from the Fitbit server and 
process the data for data display. The test on the system shows that the system has high enough throughput to be 
able to attract more data and accommodate enough user usage so that the application can be utilized by many 
users. The use of a cloud service makes it easier to withdraw data and lighter to process the data because computing 
over the cloud is performed per computing request.  
In the future, it is hoped that the application or system can be developed further in integration with other health 
devices. It is also expected that the application or system can measure, calculate, or make a diagnosis of 
abnormality in the body more quickly and accurately so that the users can find out information on their health on 
their application earlier.

Abstract 
Urban farming is growing rapidly currently. This has an impact on the use of systems and technologies that support 
urban farming. Problems faced by urban farming managers include difficulties in checking, extreme natural 
conditions, and limited knowledge related to plant management. The use of IoT in supporting Urban Farming has been 
done by many other researchers. However, so far there has been no research that synergizes IoT and Microservices in 
supporting Urban Farming. Synergy of IoT and Microservices can optimize Urban Farming's productivity and 
efficiency. In this study, we used system development approach to construct the system. We divided into three stages, 
such as requirement analysis, design and implementation. The result in this study are system architecture and prototype 
system, which is include system architecture design, and list of microservices in system architecture. Then, we 
provided some features in system architecture.

1. Introduction
Agricultural commodities are one of the important aspects in meeting the needs of food supply (Naik et al. 2018) 
Urban farming is increasingly in demand by people who live in big cities (Buehler et al. 2016 ) Urban agriculture is 
oriented towards realizing the ease of fulfilling daily food needs and creating additional urban green open spaces 
(Horst et al. 2017). However, there are several challenges currently being faced by many farmers and owners of urban 
gardens or urban farming. Manually caring plant tends to take time in the process and there can be human error from 
the results obtained (Rajalakshmi et al .2018) 
In the agricultural and plantation industries, temperature and weather greatly affect the process of plant development 
and the results obtained (Weng et al However, with weather conditions that are currently uncertain and often change 
(B. Parkes et al), there are temperature conditions that can change for plants and can hamper crop yields and others. 
Third, limited knowledge on how to check and determine the pH of water, soil moisture, and plant conditions can also 
have an unfavourable impact and results are not optimal (Higgins et al. 2017), Irregular plant caring and watering 
schedules damage plant development (Katsoulas et al. 2006).  These conditions result in frequent damage to crops, 
crop failures and a decrease in the quantity and quality of crop yields. Therefore, the development of a system that 
can help industrialization and modernization of urban farming. One technique that can be applied to overcome this 
problem is to develop a smart system for urban farming cultivation using IoT and Microservices. 
1.1 Objectives 
The research objectives in this study are to analyzing systems requirement, to design systems architecture and design 
prototyping systems for urban farming. The systems would be developed based on Internet of Things and 
Microservices Architecture. We combined Internet of Things and Microservices Architecture (MSA) to implement 
systems requirement and systems design.

Abstract  
The basic process in metal fabrication industry is welding which poses several risks and hazards to the workers. 
Welding process contributes to work related problems and is the most common method of metal joining and a part 
of metal fabrication work. The general process in metal fabrication is cutting, welding, drilling, grinding hammering 
and painting. The welding methods include horizontal welding, vertical welding and overhead welding. Welding 
operators report high musculoskeletal complaints, back, neck and shoulder discomfort and pain in knees and ankles. 
Manual welding and heavy lifting, awkward postures like bending, twisting, kneeling, stretching and working 
overhead are the reasons for discomfort and pain. About five welding units are elected for study where different 
works like general fabrication, furniture making and heavy welded structures are fabricated. In the study the 
discomfort and postural assessment of welding operators is carried out.  A total of 66 welding operators are 
identified and a modified discomfort survey was administered to know the discomfort faced during work at different 
awkward postures. The average age of operators is 33.5±9.62 year and experience 12.63±9.40 year. Ergonomic 
assessment tools Rapid Upper Limb Assessment, Rapid Entire Body Assessment (RULA and REBA) and Quick 
Exposure Checklist (QEC) was used to determine the risk levels. Results of RULA indicate 64% postures in high 
risk in vertical and overhead welding. REBA results indicate 57% postures in high risk and 7% in very high risk. 
QEC results indicate 62% in high risk, which are near equal to RULA scores. Few selected postures at different 
workstations are modeled in CATIA and assessed in RULA. The actual workstation with human manikin is also 
modeled and suitable ergonomic interventions in CATIA are demonstrated. The level of risk is considerable reduced 
(from 7 to 4 in RULA) by implementing the suggested changes in workstation and postures. The study also indicates 
that the safety measures and awareness can be further strengthened and interventions carried out to increase workers 
awareness in areas like safety training, usage of PPEs and enforcing appropriate safety regulations.

Abstract 
This study aims to analyze the timeliness in the construction of a project. Time efficiency of project 
implementation is one of the efforts in optimizing the use of implementation time. CPM is a network method 
used to determine the critical path of each implementation. Schedule delays in construction projects are one of 
the problems that can harm various parties to the project. This method is taken by eliminating multitasking, 
student syndrome, parkinson's law and providing a buffer at the end of the project. This study uses a System 
Literature Review (SLR) approach which is used to identify and answer existing questions and the results are 
relevant. Project implementation wants to find a useful method to improve the quality of planning and control in 
the face of a complex number of activities. Then a network method was found that serves to provide systematic 
planning, scheduling, and control. With the PERT and CPM methods, the time scheduling of a project will be 
more regular, as well as the availability of human resources which greatly affect the success of the development 
of a project. This study aims to compare the Pert and CPM methods in carrying out the development of a 
project. Based on research using this method to prove that by using the PERT and CPM methods the 
development of a project will run optimally, effectively and efficiently. So that it can be used as a reference in 
project implementation performance.

1. Introduction
Discussing a project or business will always be related to management (Davis and Comeau, 2020). Management 
is concerned with planning, executing, and supervising a specific project (eg, home renovation). Managing a 
home renovation project is different from building a house from scratch, including managing resources such as 
labor, materials, duration of completion, and costs required (Aithal, 2017). Obviously, the main goal is to avoid 
losses and obtain maximum profits (Naldi et al., 2019). A project implementation in accordance with the 
planning, it is necessary to make a schedule so that the project runs smoothly. According to (Telaumbauna, et al, 
2017), the project is considered successful or not depending on a project planning, scheduling and control that is 
managed effectively and efficiently. Project management is a process of planning, organizing, directing, and 
controlling the activities of organizational members as well as other resources so that they can achieve 
predetermined organizational goals (Arianie and Puspitasari, 2017, Ekanugraha, 2016). 
In a network analysis, several control systems are needed in doing so, including single activities, combined 
activities, parallel activities, and critical paths. The network is a description of a flow and sequence in each work 
activity so that each individual project work can more easily understand (Husen, 2018). According to Pontan 
and Christianto, (2019), the success of a project is if the project can be carried out based on the schedule and 
project guidelines, namely on time, right quality, and right cost, zero accident, zero waste, satisfaction of all 
parties, and others. Opinion Putri et al., (2020) states that the quality and condition of the equipment is one of 
the dominant factors influencing the success of a construction project.

the duration of a particular activity can be extended without extending the duration. the entire project 
(Stevenson, 2018). 
The success of using the PERT technique can save project completion time two years ahead of the planned 
schedule, so this method is widely used on large projects, especially on research and research projects where 
these projects have never been carried out and do not have However, if the late activity is not known, then a 
rescheduling is carried out using the Critical Path Method to find activities that can delay the project completion 
time (Ukamaka, 2020). In addition, there are several benefits to using the CPM method, these benefits include 
(Citra, 2018). In the implementation of the project, there are obstacles or deviations, causing the project 
completion time to be inaccurate. According to Cynthia in an article written by Aribisala, et.al. (Aribisala  ey al. 
2017) said that most organizations that carry out project work are not completed on time because the executive 
does not have access to real-time project plans and schedules. 
 
6. Conclusions 
In a project, there are many activities that have complex dependencies, and project management here is a very 
challenging job for all managers. In this case, both the CPM and PERT analyzes show almost the same results, 
and the project completion time using the two methods differs by only one day. PERT analysis proved to be 
more effective with a calculated project completion probability of 99.8%. This paper also proves that the 
method is effective and efficient to apply in this field. Examples of the application of the CPM method are 
widely used in development projects. One example is used to optimize the ATV (all-terrain vehicle) 
manufacturing process by considering time constraints and available resources. 
 
7. Suggestion 
In building a project it is highly recommended to use this method, namely PERT and CPM. Timeliness in 
project development depends on the situation and conditions, the most important of which is the available 
manpower. PERT and CPM assist in programming and monitoring the progress of the stages involved so that 
the project is completed within the deadline. 
  
The development of a project can run optimally with the PERT and CPM methods because it has been proven 
that the methods are very effective and efficient. Many researchers find it very helpful with the PERT and CPM 
methods. The success of using the PERT technique can save project completion time two years ahead of the 
planned schedule, so this method is widely used on large projects, especially on research and research projects. 
where these projects have never been carried out and do not have definite completion data.

Abstract 
This study aims to apply the taguchi concept in improving the quality of rice. Quality is the level of good or bad level 
or degree of an object and living thing. While the taguchi concept is an experiment that allows steps taken by producers 
in choosing a product or process that functions more consistently and minimizes other factors. uncontrollable factors. 
This study uses the System Literature Review method which is used to determine the methodology with relevant 
questions by presenting evidence that underlies the relevant data. As a source of energy, almost half of the world's 
population consumes rice as a staple food. Until now, the way of planting rice is still the traditional way. This has a 
direct impact on the quantity and quality of rice produced. With objective considerations of color and milling results 
or subjectively with taste and aroma in order to measure the availability of consumers to pay for superior rice quality. 
However, the results show that to capture this value, rice sellers must be able to convey information about quality and 
storage attributes. Consumers need to know what information is in rice. In addition, it is important to have further 
learning about good rice handling, so that one day they can deal with obstacles such as pest attacks or crop failure.

1. Introduction
Rice is the staple food of rice consumed by more than half of the human population and has been combined with many 
cultures from various countries. (Haiyan Cen, Dawai Sun 2019) (A. Rita, C. Jorge 2018). Food quality and 
characteristics affect consumer interest so that consumer demand increases and influences to improve the quality of 
rice quality (Bao 2014). 
Environmental conditions greatly affect rice quality factors, such as cold temperatures will make rice less good (Li et 
al 2018). Combining yield and quality in rice is not easy, because measuring quality cannot explain sensory 
(Calingacion 2015). Rice value increases with reduced grain damage during harvest and postharvest (C Prom-u-thai, 
B. Rerkasem 2020). The commercialization of rice production means that farmers' decisions regarding quality can be
influenced by consumer preferences in other parts of the country or in other parts of the world. Throughout Asia,
where most of the world's rice is grown and consumed, rice varieties are often recognized by their grain quality features 
(C Prom-u-thai,B.Rerkasem 2020).
Biochemical content is one of the essential rice seed parameters used for grading rice quality, and it is time consuming 
(Figure 1), laborious and expensive to measure, so as to achieve high throughput phenotypes for genetic studies on 
rice seed quality, such as molecular breeding programs and functional genomic studies. (Sun et al. 2019).

the formation of different expressed starch biosynthesis-related proteins and identification of modifications. 
posttranslational (PTM) targets starch biosynthetic proteins as well (Piengtawan Tappiban, Yining Ying, Feifei Xu 
and Jinsong Bao, 2021). Rice starch can be converted into various forms by reducing or increasing the amylose 
content, depending on consumer and regional preferences. Low-amylose rice is preferred by consumers because of its 
softness and sticky appearance. A better way to improve plants than downregulation and overexpression of genes or 
genes can be achieved through posttranslational modification of regulatory sites or enzymes that regulate them because 
of their significance (Tosin Victor Adegoke, Yifeng Wang, Lijuan Chen, Huimei Wang, Wanning Liu, Xingyong Liu, 
Yi-Chen Cheng, Xiaohong Tong, Jiezheng Ying and Jian Zhang, 2021). The starch biosynthetic proteins in rice seeds 
are differentially expressed in developing seeds at different developmental stages. All proteins involved in starch 
biosynthesis were identified using proteomic methods. Most of the proteins related to starch biosynthesis basically 
increased at 6-20 days after flowering (DAF) and decreased at high temperature conditions. A total of 10, 14, 2, 17, 
and 7 proteins related to starch biosynthesis were identified as targets of phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, 
succinylation, lysine 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, and malonylation. Phosphoglucomutase is generally targeted by five 
types of PTM (Piengtawan Tappiban, Yining Ying, Feifei Xu and Jinsong Bao, 2021). 
6. Conclusion
Rice is an important commodity that is a source of staple food for some countries, therefore the quality of rice is also 
highly considered. With improved rice quality, it can help the economy of a country and help farmers. With proper 
handling, it reduces the risk of crop failure. how to deal with problems in rice plants, such as pests and diseases on 
rice leaves that result in later rice growth, besides that this journal will help rice producers and farmers increase their 
yields and products in order to get more profits and customer satisfaction and consumers are carried out. 
The Taguchi concept helps the understanding of producers to determine the correct way of planting rice. The 
Systematic Literature Review also aims to find or process data that helps in improving the quality of superior rice. 
7. Suggestions
To the farmers to know the survival of rice, in addition to expanding the land to be used as rice fields because a lot of 
land has been converted. Use of fertilizers in accordance with the guidelines of the local Agriculture Service. 
Counseling to farmers about new methods to improve rice quality. Hope for further research namely making better 
research with more accurate methods and so that this research can be used as a guide for future research.

Abstract 
Forecasting as demand in the culinary industry is very necessary for decision making in the supply of culinary 
ingredients and reducing stock outs that often occur. This study uses a single moving average (SMA) and single 
exponential smoothing (SES) time series to make a forecast or demand forecast with the culinary industry and 
raw materials. Forecasting is an attempt to predict what will happen in the future based on previous data or past 
data based on scientific and qualitative methods that are carried out systematically. (MAPE and Exponential 
Moving Average (EMA) show that a single moving average has more accurate results when compared to the 
Single exponential smoothing method. This research method uses systematic interpretation to study and identify 
the effectiveness of simple time series forecasting, especially the culinary industry. By comparing the accuracy 
of each SMA and SES methods, SMA has the smallest error rate in forecasting. Therefore, the time series method 
in predicting time series is simple in the culinary industry. room in the culinary industry, the company uses a good 
forecasting system for sales, purchases, supply and demand with a simple time series forecasting method, where 
the industry has succeeded in reducing preparation costs and production inventory costs. with time series 
forecasting, p this conducted for give integration to be more optimal in development industry culinary that.

I. Introduction
Research in time series analysis and forecasting has traditionally been concerned with modeling autocorrelation 
structures in stationary time series. However, as discussed (Fildes, 1983) recent empirical work has shown this to 
be a relatively unimportant issue compared to trend modeling  (Richard, 2019). For example, (Sheren, 2020) 
evaluating the post-sample accuracy of 21 automated forecasting methods on a set of 1,001 time series the 
(Antonyio, 2019) accuracy of all methods deteriorates badly on wait times over the next few steps. This is 
especially true for methods based on linear trends which usually exceed data on long waiting times (Anne, 2019). 
In its use, a simple time series is used because not all raw materials are sent and needed on the same day and time. 
in fortune teller n.  (Romeo, 2021)The existence of simple time series forecasting of raw materials that is excessive 
can increase storage costs and will lead to opportunity costs of capital that must be invested in other, more 
profitable sectors. On the other hand, too many simple time series forecasts of insufficient raw materials will cause 
the continuity of the production process and company operations to be disrupted  (Antonyio, 2019). This causes 
the company to incur more expensive emergency forecasting costs(Aktepe, 2021). 
The problem faced by the management of course wants that the number of demand forecasts produced can meet 
all requests in accordance with estimates in one period in the future without using a simple time series method. 
So that the company has difficulty in predicting the amount of production in the future. (Gideon, 2020) With the 
capacity of resources such as machines, working hours and limited labor, management wants to make decisions 
by determining the amount of production in order to increase the available capacity  (Homigas, 2021). One of the 
decisions taken by management is to recruit non-permanent employees or apply overtime, in fact it is not 
uncommon for both to be done if the situation requires time series forecasting  (Hamdan, 2021). This time series 
forecasting method by applying overtime certainly makes production costs increase (Akeu, 2021) And these 
profits can be used to be allocated to add other investments or to expand the culinary business which already exists

Figure 5. Overview of Simple Time Series Forecasting Calculations 
Source: (Sheren, 2020) 
 
The data was obtained from 2017 to 2022 which shows the calculation that the volatility of the culinary industry 
shows the calculation of MAD 38%, MAPE 25%, EMA 22% and SES 15% (Figure 5). If the MAD movement 
has a high accuracy value, this indicates that the full costing method has a fairly good accuracy (Angela, 2022) 
compared to the simple moving average, thus creating an analytical concept that with the application of this 
forecasting the culinary industry can be more advanced (Sheren, 2020). Perspectives on forecasting may be as 
diverse as any other group of scientific methods (Seker, 2021). The company always sets goals and objectives, 
tries to estimate environmental factors, then determines the actions that are expected to result in the achievement 
of these goals and objectives  (Loly, 2020). This study discusses the forecasting model for the selected culinary 
industry  (Anine, 2020). Because forecasting in the culinary industry in 2022 has increased quite well (Grace, 
2021). Smoothing bases its predictions on the principle of average past error (Averaging smoothing past error) by 
adding the percentage of the previous prediction error (percentage of past error). error), which is obtained from 
the difference between the actual value and the predicted value (Gideon, 2020). The decomposition bases its 
predictions by dividing the time series data into several components which will then combine the predictions of 
these components  (Richard, 2019). 
 
 
Figure 6. Stsamplerd Error Simple Time Series 
Source: (Andreas, 2018) 
 
From the interpretation of the data (Figure 6), it shows that the range from 2017 to 2021 has a sampler error which 
is calculated through the existence of a structured development concept where in this case the interpretation of 
several time series shows that there is a forecasting relationship that has a (Roy, 2021)structured development to 
be one of the most important things to improve, not only that, in the development process it requires a form of 
system which is one of the most important and highest forecasting since 2020, 5 of these calculations, the index 
is one of the most important things to be implemented comprehensively. intact (Lula, 2020). Time series analysis 
is based on the assumption that the time series consists of components of Trend/Tendency (T), Cycle/cycle (C), 
Seasonal Pattern (S), and Random Variation (R) which will show a certain pattern (Antonyio, 2019). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Forecasting is a prediction about what will happen in the future. Companies that produce manufactured goods 
require raw materials, just as the culinary industry requires raw materials in its production process. In meeting the 
needs of raw materials, forecasting is needed. From the understanding of the experts above, it can be concluded 
that forecasting is the art and science of predicting future events by conducting a study of historical data to find

systematic relationships, tendencies, and patterns. Forecasting in the culinary industry is very important. obtained 
that SMA has the smallest error rate in forecasting. Therefore, the use of SMA is the best time series method in 
predicting simple time series in the culinary industry. 
 
7. Suggestions 
Forecasting results are said to be biased if the forecast is too high or low compared to what actually happened. 
Forecasting results are said to be consistent if the magnitude of the forecasting error is relatively small. Forecasting 
that is too low will result in a shortage of inventory, so that consumer demand cannot be met immediately as a 
result the company can lose customers and lose sales profits. Forecasting that is too high will result in a buildup 
of inventory, so that a lot of capital is absorbed in vain. Judging from the accuracy of the calculations in time 
series forecasting with calculations from 2017 to 2022, this forecast must have a high level of accuracy in MAD 
so that the culinary industry is able to forecast demand.

Abstract 
Green tea is a drink that is quite familiar in the community, this drink has many benefits for both health and beauty. 
In addition to Indonesia, this drink is also well known to foreign countries and has even become the top three in the 
category of drinks that are often consumed by the world community. The reason why green tea is widely consumed 
by the public is because green tea is good for dieting. The high antioxidant and anti-cancer content contained in it is 
also good for health for both men and women. In addition, the easy way of serving this tea is also the reason people 
consume this drink. Green tea can be served hot or cold. With research using this systematic Literature Review 
method, we can find out in more detail about the efficacy of green tea. In addition, research with this method is also 
real with 99% correct results because the researcher uses several journals as comparison material. In the 
establishment of an industry, of course, many problems are found in its implementation. Seven tools or 7QC can be 
used to help solve existing problems because it provides several menus that can be used to research problems. 
Besides being used to solve problems, this tool can also be used to control unwanted things. From these seven tools 
we can also see the problem so we can fix it faster before this problem gets more complicated.

1. Introduction
Green tea or green tea is one of the drinks that is quite well known among the public Indonesia. According to 
research, green tea is one of the most frequently consumed beverages in the world (Erastus Mosha and Ruíz, 2010) 
In recent years, scientists have learned that the green tea plant has potential health benefits. This research has shown 
that the main component that is very beneficial is catechins (Reygaert, 2017) Besides being known as a drink that 
many enjoy, green tea is also famous for drinks that have many benefits that are important for health. Green tea or 
green tea can also increase antioxidant capacity (Chopra, 2016).  In addition to containing high antioxidants so it is 
good for health, green tea also contains many antitumor and antimicrobial properties (Xu, Xu, and Zheng, 2017).  
Seven tools or better known as 7QC is a tool used to analyze cause and effect, solve problems, seek to improve 
results and work processes. In simple terms this tool can be used to control statistical processes using various tools 
such as graphs, histograms, as well as a control chart (Pramono et al., 2018). 7QC can be applied to reduce problems 
at every stage of production and can improve the performance of the production process (Memon et al., 2019). 
Seven tools are presented in addition to solving some problems as well as controlling unwanted things. This tool can 
also be applied to find out things that affect production in an industry (Doctoral, 2019). 
1.1 Research Questions 
1) How is the process of implementing the seven tools in the green tea industry?
2) How is the impact of the seven tools on the production of the Green tea industry?

questionnaire from males (87%) and females (13%) of 
55 members of potter's families from 14 villages under 
6 Upazila of Rajshahi district having various ages, 58% 
were 15 to 24 years 
 
The obstacles in establishing an industry are very diverse, both from within and outside the company (Ingaldi & 
Ulewicz, 2020).  The current industry competition is very tight, not only about the speed of production and meeting 
targets but also high quality (Aprina, 2021).  With this competition, businessmen are required to have up-to-date 
ideas so they don't fall behind and go out of business. But the innovation also must not eliminate the characteristics 
of a product (R. Ginting & Fattah, 2020).  Seven tools are the main factors that must be considered to prevent 
unwanted things from happening. The seven tools method is a very simple method to solve problems (Nirwana et 
al., 2022).  There are seven steps that must be considered in dealing with problems that occur in the industry using 
the seven tools method (Rosnani Ginting & Wibowo, 2020).  There are seven menu options offered in the seventools 
menu. The menu does not have to be used in its entirety, because of its simplicity, the seven tools are widely used by 
industry managers (Schaarschmidt et al., 2020).  
 
Defects in the management of goods must also be avoided so that the goods to be marketed have good quality. 
Defects of these goods can be avoided by rigorous research and sorting of goods before they are marketed 
(Zamrodah, 2016).  Goods that pass the next selection go to the packing stage and items that do not pass the 
selection go into damaged goods. But before the defective item is destroyed, the item is collected for data collection 
and research so that errors can be identified in which part of the item must be repaired (Duganova et al., 2022).  
 
6. Conclusion 
Green tea has many benefits for health, beauty and fitness. Green tea drinks are in great demand by the public, both 
from within and outside the country and become the number 3 drink that is widely consumed. But with these many 
benefits, green tea also has many problems, both in terms of planting and selling. These obstacles can be overcome 
by using the seven tools menu. Seven tools is a very simple menu so that someone who uses it does not require 
special training. The data that is processed in this menu is very simple and also very detailed so that it is very helpful 
for users. The accuracy of this menu reaches 95% in solving problems. 
 
Seven tools provide seven menus that can be processed in such a way, the frequently used data are Check Sheets, 
Graphs (Trend Analysis), Histograms, Pareto charts, Cause-and-effect diagrams, Spread diagrams, Control charts. 
The chart does not need to be used all of it, only part of it is used according to user needs. Data collection for 
samples must also be considered because this also requires a high level of accuracy. Most industries use the seven 
tools menu only up to the cause-and-effect diagram. 
 
7. Suggestion  
Solving problems using seventools is indeed very simple, but much attention must be paid to data collection so that 
more fatal errors do not occur. The biggest problems must also be addressed immediately so that the industry does 
not experience many losses resulting in more losses. In collecting data for samples, it is better to use several teams 
to minimize errors. The data taken must also be in accordance with what is needed and do not just take it because it 
will affect the results obtained later.

Abstract 
The increasing demands of community mobility certainly require transportation facilities that can provide movement 
and movement from one place to another quickly. This study uses the System Literature Review method which is used 
to determine the methodology with relevant questions by presenting evidence regarding the data. Online transportation 
is an internet-based transportation service that can be accessed through applications on smartphones, this is due to the 
development of the times and increasingly rapid technological advances. The existence of online application-based 
transportation Go-Jek, Grab, and Bluebird that combines transportation services with communication technology in 
the Indonesian transportation world, makes people have to determine which transportation is most suitable for their 
mobility needs. The development of online transportation is a challenge for the public policy sector to be able to follow 
the development of information technology. Moreover, digital society that uses information technology assistance to 
carry out daily activities has different characteristics from the conditions of the previous society. This study aims to 
analyze and describe the relationship between online transportation and meeting people's needs with online 
transportation. Online transportation has succeeded in driving social change at three levels, namely the individual 
level, the level between individuals, and the community level. The results of this study conclude that with online 
transportation, people's activities in traveling are greatly helped by online transportation, with easy ordering and price 
offers that many people are helped in today's very congested transportation solutions.

1. Introduction
In the current disruptive era, technological developments are developing so rapidly that it encourages the creation of 
new innovations and ultimately replaces the previous technology. One of the industries that is experiencing very rapid 
growth at this time is in the online-based transportation business (Azizah and  Adawia, 2018). Ride sharing online 
transportation services were introduced in Indonesia since 2010 and became popular with the public in 2014 (Gilang 
et al. 2017). Online transportation has succeeded in driving social change at three levels, namely the individual level, 
the inter-individual level and the community level (Widiyatmoko 2018). The online transportation application also 
consists of various services, namely ordering food, purchasing tickets, picking up goods, shopping, and so on, which 
greatly help the community in time efficiency. The ease of using applications and features that help mobility using 
smartphones make online transportation applications more attractive, especially in big cities with high congestion 
rates (Sitanayah et al. 2020). 
There is a significant influence on job opportunities and community welfare with online motorcycle taxis that can 
absorb labor and increase MSME income through various services available in online motorcycle taxi applications 
(Sari et al., 2019). The success of a service in the service sector is supported by the performance of online

existence of online transportation services in Palangka Raya City has an impact on city taxi drivers (angkot) which 
causes them to experience a decrease in passenger interest. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Online transportation is an internet-based transportation service that can be accessed through applications on 
smartphones, this is due to the times and technological advances that are growing rapidly. The existence of 
transportation breakthroughs based on Go-Jek, Grab, and Bluebird online applications that combine transportation 
services with communication technology in the Indonesian transportation world, makes people have to determine 
which transportation is most suitable for their needs for mobility. 
 
7. Suggestions 
Transportation in Indonesia has greatly helped the community as a mobility solution that is easy to access using a 
smartphone, but it is better to continue to maintain quality and comfort for its consumers. Transportation in Indonesia 
must also continue to develop to always be updated according to what consumers need, such as in terms of comfort 
and safety, and there needs to be comparisons and implementation of foreign systems that are compatible with 
Indonesia. In addition, Indonesia should use foreign parties as opponents to compete to improve public services.

Abstract 
In the present scenario, industries are trying to increase their productivity and it is easily acquired with the execution of 
Industry4.0 (I4.0) technologies in industries. Not only the productivity but also the smooth flow of supply chain in 
industries etc. Even though there are several fruitful advantages, there is still a lack in the execution of I4.0 mainly in 
small and medium-sized industries of different sectors. Certain hindrances are the root cause of this dearth in industries. 
A few papers trying to figure out the same issue but it has been found some of the barriers are missing in their analysis 
and the ranking of barriers is not focused on. Consequently, the primary theme of the research is to find the barriers by 
reviewing several research papers and ranking them by collecting data with the help of different experts through 
questionnaires for pair-wise comparison matrix, working in SMEs. The Analytical Hierarchy Process technique has been 
used to rank the barriers and find the relative importance. In this study, it has been found that 21 barriers are responsible 
for creating hindrances to the execution of I4.0 technologies in SMEs. Out of the 21 barriers, 12 important barriers are 
selected for further analysis. After choosing the twelve barriers, it is necessary to explore their interactions and identify 
the ones that have the most influence over the others. This is achieved by the Fuzzy-Interpretive Structural Modelling 
Approach and MICMAC analysis of Industry 4.0.

 Introduction 
Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) are having unique definitions as per countries. (Venkatesh and Muthiah 
2012) explained about SMEs that due to their major contribution to output, exports, and employment, small and medium-
sized industries are plays a major role in the economic rate of Indian countries. The small sector is a significant source 
of employment for millions of people are available and the laborers are available for cheap in India and resources are 
expensive. (Dutta et al. 2020) pointed out that the growth of the Indian economy also depends mostly on the 
manufacturing sector, Indian government has created a policy in 2011, known as the National manufacturing policy to 
induce the advantages of I4.0 in industries. 
Singh et al. (2008), explained in his study about the definition of SMEs, according to different countries like USA 
considering industries has “very small” if employees are less than 20, “small” if the employees are in between 22-99, 
“medium” if the employees are in between 100 to 499, Vietnam generally not have any fixed definition but normally

1. Introduction
Creative industries are diverse. The development of the creative industry in Indonesia continues to experience changes 
and improvements (Cahyandito, 2012). This means that Indonesia is able to compete with foreign parties and innovate 
in the creative economy industry. Therefore, the creative industry is a process needed to create creativity by a group 
of people or individuals to produce a work which is then used as an economic product. These economic products, can 
generate profits without exploiting natural resources. The creative industry is here to help create new jobs. It can be 
said that the creative economy has an important role in the economic development of a country, as well as globally ( 
Wilson and Stokes, 2005). In addition, the creative economy sector produces several new industrial sectors. The birth 
of the creative industry clearly has a positive impact and great benefits for the country, especially in the economic 
sector. Where, through the creative economy, a country can compete with other countries (Wilson and Stokes, 2005). 
Baso Tahu itself is a dish that covers a fairly large area in Indonesia, especially Bandung. Dishes that are often claimed 
to be the local speciality in Bandung certainly have an effect or influence on the demand for culinary products, 
especially in Indonesia, which is reflected in the projection data that explains the size of the culinary industry market. 
Overall, Tofu Baso has become one of the most prominent culinary products for Baso Tahu Ena Ena target market. 
This culinary dish has many different types of target markets. Several well-known competitors really reflect the desire 
of the audience coverage of Baso Tahu Ena Ena. Around 4 to 5 competitors of Baso Tahu Ena Ena serve similar dishes 
with quite different target markets. This is because the Baso Tahu Ena Ena company provides options so that this dish 
can be enjoyed by all people with their respective beliefs. Therefore, behind the oriental visuals, Baso Tahu Ena Ena 
takes steps as a halal dish. The business strategy carried out by Baso Tahu Ena Ena in running this business is the 
Marketing Mix and Marketing Process. Marketing Mix is a strategy used by companies to formulate product or service 
offerings for their customers by combining marketing elements such as Products or Services, Place, Price and 
Promotion  which is usually abbreviated as with the 4P Marketing Mix (Kotler, 2006). The main goal of this Marketing

6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
Based on the discussion on Business Performance, it can be concluded that The Baso Tahu Ena Ena shop in the span of 
8 months August 2021 to March 2022 is still experiencing stagnation in sales where the percentage increase is only around 
12%, 16%, and there is even a decrease. The value of gross profit for several months is still minus. If the Pro Forma value 
is projected until 2026 with the assumption of a 50% increase and 3% inflation every year, then in 2026 the value of the 
Pro Forma Income Statement with this result, Kedai Baso Tahu Ena Ena must implement a new strategy in order to 
achieve this Figure 7. The percentage growth of the balance sheet from August 2021 to March 2022 initially increased to 
September by 75%, then decreased drastically in November to 14% and especially January 2021 by 35%. The marketing 
strategy used is updating Instagram accounts and selling at Sudirman Street Day and Night Market at the appointed time, 
as well as conducting bazaars to increase turnover. After implementing a digital marketing plan and market introduction 
that has been made in the form of promotions on Instagram media, the response obtained is a positive response in terms 
of increased sales, and in line with the increase in sales, the number of consumers also increases. From the data on 
Instagram insights, it is also known that one of the biggest achievements is the relatively high reach of the Kedai Baso 
Tahu Ena Ena account. Innovation or novelty value from product variants, packaging, many collaboration opportunities, 
logistics updates also affect the increase in profits and the relaxation of PPKM which makes SMEs revive, especially 
Kedai Baso Tahu Ena Ena. As a company that is struggling in the food sector has done many experiments in terms of 
marketing. The results that can be analyzed will produce values that can form suggestions from the author. The 
recommendation that can be given from this research is that it is very important for a company to try to carry out marketing 
updates in different ways according to the needs of its business and business. Many determinations and analyzes can be 
made to help increase turnover. Along with this very influential Pandemic era, companies must quickly adapt to the 
environment. After successfully finding the best and most suitable way to implement it, the company can focus more on 
developing its marketing strategy while still paying attention to feedback from consumers and conducting regular

Abstract 
This study focused on the potential to produce biochar from sewage sludge as a waste valorisation initiative. A 
process for the production of biochar from waste sewage sludge is proposed. Sewage sludge carbonization was 
done at 300-500 ◦C and retention times of 1-2 hours. Biochar yields of up to 58% were achieved and the biochar 
had a surface area of 240 mg/g. Initial cost evaluations indicated that for the plant producing 2.8 tons of activated 
biochar, a rate of return of 41.2% and payback period of 4.3 years.

1. Introduction
The increase in the production of sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants is causing concern due to 
possible risks to the environment (Ahmad et al., 2012). Primary sludge contains settle able solids removed during 
primary treatment in primary and secondary clarifiers. The sludge usually is in the form of a semi-solid containing 
24-26%. wt. depending on the treatment operations.
2. Sewage Sludge Valorisation
The excess sewage sludge produced during the biological treatment of municipal wastewater requires expensive 
disposal procedures including advanced treatment: the cost of sludge disposal accounts up to 50% of the overall 
cost of wastewater treatment (Bridgewater, 2011). In addition, due to the potentially high metal content, 
uncontrolled sewage sludge disposal may induce soil and groundwater pollution.  
2.1 Sewage sludge characteristics and treatment 
Sewage sludge comprises of organic and inorganic substances as well as water (Capodaglio et al. 2016). The first 
step in sewage processing is sludge thickening to form lager particles (Chia et al. 2015). The initial sewage sludge

Abstract 
With the increasing concern for environmental sustainability over the last few years and the proliferation of 
international standards and agreements, environmental policies and practices need to be implemented by 
organizations. Most divisions such as marketing, supply chain, finance, and others have used ecological management 
in organizations. Human Resource Management recently became part of the Go Green campaign. “The integration of 
Environmental Management (EM) and HRM practices is known as Green Human Resource Management (GHRM)”. 
The paper aims to provide conceptual guidance on Green HRM, provide a thematic overview of challenges for Green 
HRM, identify gaps in the current research and provide specific directions for future research. The study uses a 
Systematic Literature Review approach following the stages suggested by Tranfield et al. (2003). Based on the 
findings of identified studies, a thematic review is developed with broad themes underlying the prominent 
drivers/inhibitors associated with Green HRM adoption and implementation. Based on the analysis of themes, gaps in 
the current research are identified, and clear directions for future research were created with an aim to devise, 
recommend and propose policies to promote Green HRM adoption and implementation.

1.Introduction
In recent years, concerns about environmental issues have increased, especially with the Industrial Revolution, which 
led to severe depletion of natural resources and undue pressure on the natural environment. The growing global interest 
in protecting the environment has led countries around the world to pursue a green plan. Companies operate in a highly 
competitive global economy, where in addition to meeting the organizational goal, the environmental goal must also 
be met, that is, being responsible for the environment. Today even organizations are becoming more involved and 
aware of environmental issues and sustainable development (Masri and Jaaron, 2017).  
Sustainable development includes three key Ps, namely ""Profit, Planet and People"", which imply economic, 
environmental and social benefits. A study by Siyambalapitiya, Zhang, and Liu (2018) showed that many public and 
private organizations have started adopting green strategies and are finding ways to solve environmental problems. 
One solution to this was that organizations could adopt and apply the concept of ""green human resource management"" 
(GHRM) and thereby contribute to a sustainable environment (Ren, Tang, and Jackson, 2018). Siyambalapitiya et al., 
2018 conceptualized GHRM as a green management practice that combines organizational management practices with 
a sustainable environment Organizational employees should be encouraged, empowered and environmentally aware 
to ensure their movement towards ecological organizational functions (Tariq et al. 2016). Green Human Resource 
Management (GHRM) practices are beneficial to both organizations and the employees working there.  
However, several studies show that adopting and implementing GHRM practices is not an easy task for organizations 
and there have been several obstacles in their way (Jafri, 2012; Fayyazi et al., 2015).It was found that the

Abstract 
The goal of this study is to systematically examine research reference trends related to procurement outsourcing 
in the supply chain management from 2000 to 2022. This research will focus on the development trend of 
procurement outsourcing research in the financial services industry on Scopus data-based scholar. A mixed 
method approach was used in this study, combining bibliometric methods and a literature review. From 2000 to 
2022, 33 international publications with the keyword procurement outsourcing in the financial services industry 
were sourced from the Scopus scholar database via web scraping. According to the findings of this study, studies 
on procurement outsourcing in supply chain are dominated by several fields of study such as competitive 
procurement process, procurement function, behavior intervention product, simulation, complex equipment 
outsourcing, strategic procurement outsourcing, comparing, award outsourcing. According to the findings of this 
study, there are at least three major perspectives that are commonly used when discussing procurement 
outsourcing in the supply chain management. However, this does not imply that no other perspectives are used in 
addition to these findings. The research's limitation is the scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the 
Scopus database. The recommendations in this study can be used as hypotheses in the future, in addition to 
research with broader literature sources, and comprehensive and in-depth follow-up research can be conducted. 
The study's findings are expected to be useful to academics researching outsourcing procurement in the supply 
chain management.

study is multidimensional or cross-industries. As a result, when studying procurement outsourcing in supply chain 
management, some researchers take multiple approaches. 
Third, according to the review's findings, the following issues are frequently raised:  Action, optimal procurement, 
process perspective, procurement function, result, strategic outsourcing and theory, case study, gain, next 
candidate, outsourcing, scm social capital benefit, supply supplier integration, competitive dialogue, dynamic 
price, outsourcing contract, procurement, and production outsourcing, sourcing, telecommunications services, 
times outsourcing, profit, retail information link, role, s coordination, social welfare, competitive contract 
manufacturer, manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing. 
This study confirms that the visualizations that appear in network analysis are representations of issues that are 
frequently discussed based on the topics that are frequently researched. However, this review does not argue that 
low frequency is a minor issue. On the other hand, perhaps these issues (the outer core) are under-researched areas 
of study or approaches that are rarely used. This cluster may require additional attention in future research. 
This study comprehensively and systematically formulates knowledge clusters that are frequently used to support 
studies related to procurement outsourcing in supply chain management, based on the framing of network analysis 
contexts and supported by literature. 
5. Conclusion
Based on the findings and discussion of this study, it is concluded that the highest growth development in the 
topic field of procurement outsourcing in supply chain occurred in 2021, reaching 6 articles or an increase of up 
to 200 percent from 2021 Furthermore, the review reveals that the majority of the journals that discuss the issue 
of procurement outsourcing in supply chain management are engineering and management journals. This research 
also demonstrates that there is no dominant journal or publisher addressing the issue of procurement outsourcing 
in supply chain management. This means that research in this area is still dispersed across different journals or 
publishers. Furthermore, development maps are classified into 9 clusters based on co-occurrence and keywords. 
This review, on the other hand, summarizes the research trend of procurement outsourcing in supply chain 
management into three major issues. First, based on the research location, it's worth noting that the main country 
that have served as research locations in the twenty years have been Sweden. Meanwhile, based on the research 
approach used, the results of data analysis show that the majority of the research employs an empirical study 
approach and a case study. Comparative analysis and causal relationships are two examples of research methods 
used. In other words, some studies compare the objects that have successfully implemented procurement 
outsourcing. Furthermore, several studies have been conducted to examine the impact of implementing 
procurement outsourcing models on a variety of factors, including efficiency and productivity. In this field, 
descriptive qualitative methods are still the most commonly used approach. In terms of context or research scope, 
studies related to include procurement, manufacturing, management, production and telecommunication among 
others. According to the findings of the review of the field of study, this issue is frequently studied across a wide 
range of industries. In other words, the context of this study is multidimensional or cross-industries. As a result, 
when studying procurement outsourcing in supply chain management, some researchers take multiple approaches. 
Of course, many unexplored perspectives remain unexplored because they are not dominant perspectives. This is 
especially true when one considers how some researchers tend to use multiple approaches. As a result of this 
analysis, the contexts that are frequently discussed are also interindustry or multi-industry issues. The scope of 
the articles used, which were sourced from the Scopus database, is the research's limitation. In the future, it is 
strongly advised to conduct research using a broader literature source. Furthermore, the findings of this study can 
be used as hypotheses, and comprehensive and systematic follow-up research is being conducted. The findings of 
this study are expected to serve as a resource for academics researching procurement outsourcing in supply 
management.

Abstract 
For the past decades, the supply chain network has been significantly influenced by several major factors. Standing 
out of those is global warming which causes radical changes in traditional supply chain network. Therefore, 
environmental vulnerability with legality and economic benefits has made supply chain management to be as an 
important objective for companies and governments. Sustainability must be built-in supply chain network design 
(SCND), by striking the right balance between cost-cutting and environmental preservation. The goal of this paper 
is to develop a green closed–loop supply chain (G-CLSC) network by first, evaluating supplier selection with 
Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). Subsequently, a bi – objective Mixed-Integer Linear Programming 
(MILP) model is presented for facilities allocating and consolidate closed-loop flow, with two objectives: 
minimizing operating cost and minimizing CO2 emission. The model is testified by implying on the case of a 
Vietnamese plastic injection enterprise consisting of facilities spreading all over the country. The simulated result 
demonstrates the efficiency and validity of the proposed solution model. All possible solutions are measured 
thoroughly to identify the optimal design for prior environment protection. Ultimately, the solution model finalizes 
with a forward and a reverse supply chain network.

7. Conclusion 
With the aim of accomplishing the Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain application to improve the efficiency and 
profitability of plastic injection industry in Vietnam, this journal utilizes Analytic Hierarchy Process to evaluate 
supplier selection and Mixed Integer Linear Programming to build a Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network, 
which both help diminish cost and CO2 emission. This paper provides approaches to develop a Green Closed-
Loop Supply Chain to improve the efficiency and profitability of plastic injection industry in Vietnam. By using 
AHP method to evaluate supplier selection and Mixed Integer Linear Programing to build a Green Closed-Loop 
Supply Chain Network that both minimize cost and CO2 emission. 
By implementing the historical data of a Vietnamese firm in 2019, four industrial sites have been chosen as the 
optimal location to open new distribution center. These locations are guaranteed to generate a profit and deplete 
environment pollution in 12 months, which would be breakeven with the accepted goal of case company. 
Furthermore, through analyzing, this new network has achieved validity since differentiation between all optimal 
cost and CO2 emission for each α are very negligible (0.29% and 2.17% respectively).  
 
However, the demand, transportation and fix cost data used for the model are historical data from the past and 
may change considerably in future due to COVID-19, this limitation may decrease the proposed model accuracy 
and reliability. Moreover, even though demands used in this model is real but, it is uncertain. With this, it can be 
convinced that there are rooms for improvements and adjustments for G-CLSC problem. Thus, further research 
is crucial to help the solution model to be able to comb with the fluctuate and dynamic changes of future market.

Abstract 
E-commerce is a key move that has altered the way businesses are conducted, particularly in the retail industry.
In the e-commerce business, pricing is one of the most significant aspects in determining profitability, and closely
linked to the company's sales. The rise of online markets has necessitated the creation of a Machine Learning tool
for pricing suggestions. The aim of this study is to select a machine learning model to create a price suggestion
tool for Ecommerce enterprises. Three machine learning algorithms – Linear Regression, Random Forest and
LightGBM – are tested on a dataset of an Ecommerce enterprise to indicate the performance of models when
using in a dataset with several features and millions of rows. The study also processes to make improvement the
output of models, including parameters tuning, feature selection or remove outstanding values. The result shows
that Light GBM after Grid search CV process outperforms in terms of both prediction error and processing time.
Keywords

1. Introduction
E-commerce is a significant step that has changed the way of doing business, especially in retail market, plays an
important role in the development of the national economy in the 21st century. Simultaneously with the
development of the E-commerce industry, the massive growth of new terms such as Machine Learning (ML),
Data Science (DS), Deep Learning (DL), Artificial Intelligence (AI) have also been paid attention due to their
impact on the retailing market (Chandrashekhara et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2013; Narayana et al., 2021; Pundir et al.,
2020). Akter and Wamba (2016) believe that data plays an important role in E-commerce and all business
decisions. Furthermore, the enhancement in data availability as well as processing speed allows E-commerce
enterprise to deal with complex problems requiring a large enough dataset by using Machine Learning
applications. Machine Learning has been currently applied in some case of E-commerce such as Last Mile
delivery, Synchronized system and made predictions with strong accuracy, responded and interacted with
inconsistent market demand or reduced operations costs (Hurtado et al., 2019). Pricing is also an important term
not only in E-commerce but also all business market in the act of determining, specifying the value of product
before selling them to customers to achieve profit maximization, competitors’ matching price, market skimming
or even long-term survival. Thus, predicting price is a crucial part in e-commerce and other market sections for
planning and strategy development. The combination of the price prediction with the application of machine
learning is becoming an increasing trend in both researching and practical management expertise.
By introducing the suitable method for price prediction, it is a good opportunity for E-commerce platforms to 
automatically set the reasonable prices on massive products, reducing mistake of doing manually. The main 
objective of this article is to apply, analyze and evaluate several machine learning algorithms for predicting the 
price of multiple products exhibiting on the Ecommerce site. While establishing models, parameters are 
consecutively changed to find the best sets in each algorithm. Boosting method has also been used to enhance the 
accuracy of models, minimize processing time of the models and limit overfitting or underfit situation. Through

5. Sensitivity analysis 
Sensitivity analysis, which looks at the effect of each feature to the prediction of the model, is a simple and 
effective approach to comprehend a machine learning model. In order to measure feature sensitivity, the value of 
a feature is modified or tried to examine the model's output after ignoring it in some way while leaving all other 
characteristics unchanged (Lenhart et al., 2002; Tortorelli and Michaleris, 1994). If altering the feature value 
substantially changes the model's outcome, this feature has a significant influence on the prediction. In this study, 
the main purpose is to assume the absence of the feature in the model.  
 
It may accomplish that in models like neural networks by inserting zero. In additions, the possible way is to change 
the data by introducing it into the dataset using the mean for numerical features, a new class for categorical 
features, the highest probability value, or any other technique (Figure 7). 
 
 
 
Figure 7. Sensitivity analysis result 
 
As can be seen from the bar chart in Figure 7, trying to eliminate each of feature (exclude X) and then 
training/testing on the best algorithm – LightGBM before going through this experiment. There are top 5 features 
from the beginning that affect seriously to the results, while the others could be considered to eliminate do not 
have clearly affect to the result that when training/testing. From the fifth to the end, the result remains unchanged, 
and X is the original dataset that is a benchmark to make comparison with other cases. In conclusion, the model 
would perform better when some features are dropped, which are Subcat 1 and 2, Item condition, Shipping and 
Description length. Other than that, the performance remains stable. 
 
5 . Conclusion 
Price prediction has shown to be difficult for online marketplaces. Sellers are frequently overconfident, labeling 
items with selling prices that are far higher than they should be. The idea is to automatically determine a price for 
a product based on its attributes, which can then be used as a starting point for negotiations between buyer and 
seller. The study shows the price prediction model in terms of three algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest 
Regressor and LightGBM using one main method to evaluation: Mean absolute error. Processing time is also 
another method for assessment, but it is a sub evaluation method. Many studies have been carried out to enhance 
the performance of models, such as removing outlier values, PCA, and so on. Feature selection in collaboration 
with hyperparameters tuning is considered as one of the best solutions, and LightGBM is the leader of three 
algorithms that always performs at a good level, no matter that before or after parameter tuning. Moreover, the 
processing time of LightGBM is always around one minutes and while tuning parameters it takes less time than 
Random Forest although the number of combinations is larger than Random Forest. The result found is consistent 
with previous findings of the key reference (Chada, 2019), as well as other research in the literature (Ge et al., 
2020; Ke et al., 2017; Ponsam et al., 2021).  
 
This can be explained that because LightGBM aggregates multiple prediction models from a more developed set 
of features with properly-tuned parameters to extract final result, so it can reduce the noise as well as perform 
faster and more efficiently compared to other algorithms, even though it has the tendency to fall into overfitting 
situation.  The next consideration is to divide the dataset into small pieces according to the features or 
characteristics of each feature to achieve the better solution in each cluster. Here, clustering is not advised since 
it does not help to distinguish characteristic of each cluster, thereby manually dividing the dataset based on specific 
features is appropriate. Some features do not have significant impact on the models while the others are quite 
important that have a great influence on the result. Therefore, it should examine deeply before eliminating any 
features to exclude poor impacts to the model. In the future, it can be suggested that that future research can focus

Abstract 
Video summarizations can quickly and effectively collect the necessary data from huge surveillance datasets by 
identifying key video data in the surveillance stream. In this work, we utilize anchor free method to summarize the 
video of a surveillance camera. The anchor-free approach ignores temporal proposals that are pre-defined. It also 
predicts important values and segment locations directly. The localization of an action using temporal points is aided 
by an anchor-free action localization module. This module defines an action instance as a point with lengths to the 
starting and ending boundaries, reducing pre-defined anchor limitations on action localization and duration. For real-
time working, this work created video shots and passed each shot to our model to generate a summary of the video. 
The evaluation is done on this model, on custom dataset, which is specially created for our application

Abstract 
Nowadays, a significant percentage of companies have maintained their success due to the constant effort and strategic 
application of optimization philosophies such as lean manufacturing. However, an uncontrolled implementation can 
significantly affect the resources of the companies without achieving the desired result, in fact, some studies revel 
than more of 43 percent of unmanaged implementations of projects trend to fail. Therefore, it is important to know 
the execution of good practices and guides on project management applied to successful lean manufacturing 
developments to take them as a reference in future implementations. This article presents a systematic literature review 
that analyze a collection of 54 articles in English language during the period 2011 to 2021, in order to explore about 
good practices, models or project management tools that allow identifying areas of opportunity for future approaches 
to industrial sectors in Mexico. This work extracts scientific articles of four prestigious databases (Elsevier, 
SpringerLink, Emerald, Scopus) to classified and analyze according to: article type, participation by country, 
participation by journal, research methodology, knowledge area, implementation level and the main techniques, tools 
or models for the solution used.

1. Introduction
According to (Deif and ElMaraghy, 2014) the global competition in recent decades has created a high uncertain 
demand at the business environment and the customer expectations to adopt lean manufacturing principles and tools. 
One of the systems with higher impact in the world was the Toyota Production System implemented at the beginning 
of 1970 which is practically obsolete, nevertheless, the competitive world in these days has turn lean manufacture in 
an important model to follow which organizations around the world has try to implement, but the lack of clear 
comprehension about the principles, the performance and it’s measuring, contributes to the failure of these practices 
(Karlene M. et al., 2007) and her book “The machine that changed the world”, this practices are based in the 
improvement of the continuous flow, impulse production by the costumer, flexibility, waste elimination, zero defects, 
safe and tidy work environment and the customers quality perception. At the same time (Alireza et al., 2012) and the 
literature review proposal by (Hofer et al., 2011) mention that the use of guidelines of the 5ª edition of the body of 
knowledge of the Project management (PMBOK, 2017) can achieve an interest correlation to work along with tools 
apply of the manufacturing.

Finally, the level with the least attributions was in process with a participation of 2.1%, which means that the authors 
who used this implementation are still creating or opening new lines of research, without yet having a satisfactory 
result or the use of the tools or methodologies employed are still under discussion. 
6. Conclusion
The development of the following literature review is directly related under the influence of project management 
applied to lean manufacturing tools. In which 54 articles under study were analyzed through a qualitative analysis 
between 2011 and 2021, which show an optimal panorama of the usefulness and scope of project management as a 
tool for the development process of lean manufacturing and not only in that area but also in decision making within 
dynamic environments. 
Project management and its good practices play a very important role in the automotive area and companies that 
provide services especially, to offer a solution to problems to make use of lean manufacturing tools. It is evident that 
statistical analysis and Value Stream Mapping are the most used tools for project management problems. 
However, for the attributions by countries, it is shown that Mexico does not have significant advances in project 
management and administration that can be applied in schemes under the needs and characteristics for projects of the 
Mexican industry. This is not bad, on the contrary, the wide margins to expand new research and contributions of 
scientific articles that day by day allows us to offer a more standardized approach. Not to mention that (India) has a 
greater means of validation in its proposals, which it attributes to more successful and relevant publications for 
researchers seeking to open new paths with the use of lean manufacturing tools under a scheme of use of good practices 
for a proper project management as (Forno et al., 2014) and (Jadhav et al., 2014)pointed out that, despite the good 
results observed in the implementation of the lean manufacturing philosophy in the last decade, there are still many 
opportunities for improvement, that justifies further research in this area in order to identify critical points for the 
implementation of projects in the lean factory.

Abstract 
Industrial development has direct impact on overall economic development of a region or nation.  In the globalized 
era, it is essential for every nation to progress on par with other countries.  Owing to the globalization effect, Micro, 
Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have been providing significant contribution to Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP), industrial production, and export value.  Beside agriculture, MSMEs have been regarded as largest 
employment provider for people of the nation.  Due to the nature of low capital cost, demand for ancillary units and 
support for large industries, the MSMEs were emerged as the most dynamic industries in India.  
The 
MSMEs 
have become the life bone of the constant progress of the country.  In the present study, a critical evaluation is made 
to examine the impact of MSMEs on industrial development in erstwhile Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh State 
in India. The district being the largest venue of MSMEs in the state has significantly contributed for the industrial 
development in terms of providing largest proportion of total enterprises operating in the state.  The study aims to 
study the significance of introduction of MSMED Act, 2006 on generation of investment and employment.  Further, 
the study presents the contribution of MSMEs to GVA.

1. Introduction
Industrialization has direct impact on development.  In the globalized era, it is essential for every nation to progress 
on par with other countries.  One of the most important sources of development is development through 
industrialization.  The industrialization not only benefits the nation to prosper but also empowers the people in terms 
of providing employment opportunities as well availability of products and services.  In India, globalization affects 
India’s economic development and shows a pathway by providing a new economic policy which was adopted by the 
Government of India in July 1991. The economic policy is regarded as the milestone for the development of 
industrial and services sector.  Particularly the services industry segments such as Information Technology Enabled

6. Conclusion
The study on Industrial development and role of MSMEs statistically reveal that, for achieving the industrial 
development as well as providing the opportunities to the potential entrepreneurs and generation of employment, 
MSMEs have played pivotal role.   The revised definition of MSMEs clearly reveal that, the worth of MSMEs have 
increased in terms of investment pattern and turnover potential. The introduction of MSMED Act, 2006 is a historic 
milestone in the development of industries through the support of MSMEs.   The study on demographic profile of 
the Chittoor District shows that, due to the presence of better infrastructure facilities, being boarder to nearby states 
and presence of industrial hubs have contributed for MSME development in the district.  The statistical results show 
that, contribution to GVA has been steady since last decade and results clearly reveal that decline of growth of

Andhra Pradesh state shows that, Chittoor district remained highest in terms of presence of MSMEs.  The district 
wise progress clearly reveals that, Chittoor district remained 2nd top in terms of establishment of new MSMEs 
during 2021-2022. The presence of MSMEs in the district remained top with 98.86% of total enterprises established 
in the district. The statistical results proved that there is a significant increase in the number of units, investment 
made and employment generated in Chittoor District both before and after the introduction of MSMED Act, 2006. 
The introduction of industrial clusters reveals that, there is clear evidence of potential of industrial development in 
Chittoor district through encouragement of MSMEs.   Overall, it is to conclude that in order to contribute for 
industrial development, MSMEs played vital role in terms of investment made, presence of units and employment 
generated.  Study was also shown that COVID-19 has clear impact of MSMEs performance.  Study results of 
Chittoor District show that, substantial industrial development has been shown and the impact of MSMEs proved

Abstract 
The goal of this study is to systematically examine research reference trends related to Affiliate Marketing from 
1946 to 2022. This research will focus on the development trend affiliate marketing in e-commerce on Scopus 
data-based scholar. A mixed method approach was used in this study, combining bibliometric methods and a 
literature review. From 1946 to 2022, 46 international publications with the keyword affiliate marketing were 
sourced from the Scopus scholar database via web scraping. According to the findings of this study, studies on 
affiliate marketing in e-commerce are dominated by several fields of study such complexity approach, evolution, 
fraud, risk, marketing integration, merchant, search engine advertising, business performance, customer activity, 
digital content marketing, incentive, information, commitment, demand, e-commerce and social media. 
According to the findings of this study, there are at least three major perspectives that are commonly used when 
discussing affiliate marketing in e-commerce. However, this does not imply that no other perspectives are used in 
addition to these findings. The research's limitation is the scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the 
Scopus database. The recommendations in this study can be used as hypotheses in the future, in addition to 
research with broader literature sources, and comprehensive and in-depth follow-up research can be conducted. 
The study's findings are expected to be useful to academics affiliate marketing in e-commerce

1. Introduction
Not many studies have investigated the Affiliate Marketing in e-commerce context.   (Beranek 2019, Ballestar et 
al. 2018, Duffy 2005) Highlights the variables that influence affiliate marketing performance. Meanwhile, 
(Ivkovic and Milanov 2010) describes the importance of affiliate marketing in e-commerce.  
In this study, we analyze the model for deployment of affiliate marketing in e-commerce. Transaction and type of 
segmentation. The segmentation is based on customers' commercial activity and role within the site's social 
network. In this social network, customers profit from the transactions they make on affiliate websites (Ballestar 
et al. 2018). Merchants oversee thousands of affiliates they have never met, examine online affiliate marketing 
programs in which affiliates, whereas other merchants ask their marketing staff to perform merchants hire outside

The review provides some critical information that can be classified into at least three major issues. First, based on 
the business category, it should be noted that the major research category in recent years is tourism. Meanwhile, based 
on the research approach used, the results of data analysis show that most of the research uses an empirical study 
approach and case studies. Comparative analysis and causal relationships are two examples of research methods that 
are also used. In other words, some studies compare the object under study with objects that have successfully 
implemented affiliate marketing. Furthermore, several studies have been conducted to examine the impact of 
implementing the affiliate model on various factors. In this field, descriptive qualitative method is still the most 
commonly used approach. Although quantitative methods are still used, especially in case studies to assess affiliate 
marketing success. 
 
Second, in terms of context or research scope, this issue is frequently studied across a wide range of industries. In 
other words, the context of this study is multidimensional or cross-industries. As a result, when studying affiliate 
marketing, some researchers take multiple approaches. 
Third, according to the review's findings, the following issues are frequently raised:  complexity approach, evolution, 
fraud, risk, marketing integration, merchant, search engine advertising, business performance 
customer activity, digital content marketing, incentive, information, commitment, demand, e-commerce and social 
media. 
 
This study confirms that the visualizations that appear in network analysis are representations of issues that are 
frequently discussed based on the topics that are frequently researched. However, this review does not argue that low 
frequency is a minor issue. On the other hand, perhaps these issues (the outer core) are under-researched areas of study 
or approaches that are rarely used. This cluster may require additional attention in future research. This study 
comprehensively and systematically formulates knowledge clusters that are frequently used to support studies related 
to affiliate marketing in e-commerce, based on the framing of network analysis contexts and supported by literature. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the findings and discussion of this study, it is concluded that the highest growth development in the topic 
field of affiliate marketing occurred in 2021, reaching 11 articles or an increase of up to 200 percent from 2017. 
Furthermore, the review reveals that the majority of the journals that discuss the issue of affiliate marketing in 
management journals. This research also demonstrates that there is no dominant journal or publisher addressing the 
issue of affiliate marketing in e-commerce. This means that research in this area is still dispersed across different 
journals or publishers. Furthermore, development maps are classified into 19 clusters based on co-occurrence and 
keywords. This review, on the other hand, summarizes the research trend of affiliate marketing into three major issues 
First, based on the business category, it's worth noting that the business category that have served as research in the 
last years have been tourism. Meanwhile, based on the research approach used, the results of data analysis show that 
the majority of the research employs an empirical study approach and a case study. Comparative analysis and causal 
relationships are two examples of research methods used. In other words, some studies compare the objects that have 
successfully implemented affiliate marketing in e-commerce. Furthermore, several studies have been conducted to 
examine the impact of affiliate marketing models on a variety of factors. In this field, descriptive qualitative methods 
are still the most commonly used approach. In terms of context or research scope, this issue is frequently studied 
across a wide range of industries. In other words, the context of this study is multidimensional or cross-industries. As 
a result, when studying affiliate marketing some researchers take multiple approaches. Of course, many unexplored 
perspectives remain unexplored because they are not dominant perspectives. This is especially true when one considers 
how some researchers tend to use multiple approaches. As a result of this analysis, the contexts that are frequently 
discussed are also interindustry or multi-industry issues. The scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the 
Scopus database, is the research's limitation. In the future, it is strongly advised to conduct research using a broader 
literature source. Furthermore, the findings of this study can be used as hypotheses, and comprehensive and systematic 
follow-up research is being conducted. The findings of this study are expected to serve as a resource for academics 
researching affiliate marketing in e-commerce.

Abstract 
The study in the area of ESG has not been able to draw an ultimate conclusion which can define the phenomenon. The 
purpose of this research is to give a more complete and accurate analysis of the development trend of ESG performance 
from the earliest ESG publication in Scopus in 2006 to 2022. The purpose of the study is to establish bibliometric 
analysis as an extensive review ESG performance literature. The method used in this study consists of five steps: 
defining search keywords, initializing search results, compiling preliminary data statistics, and analyzing data. The 
result shows that as many as 267 datasets were and collected from Scopus databases and visualized using Vosviewer. 
The study also presents the potential topics for future study based on the analysis of keywords with less frequent 
occurrence.

ESG Performance, Bibliometric, Analysis, Review, and vosviewer. 
1. Introduction
In order to address global concerns like social injustice, environmental degradation, and climatic change, the Agenda 
of 2030 was set as a comprehensive plan that unifies all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated 
goals. The SDGs are the name given to these goals and targets. The SDGs call for coordinated global action by 
governments, businesses, and civil society organizations in order to achieve sustainable and shared prosperity (Khaled 
et al., 2021). One method to determine how far along businesses are in terms of their influence on the SDGs is to 
measure the effect on SDGs based on how well corporations do with sustainability.  Academic research has frequently 
used Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings to empirically quantify corporate sustainability 
performance. (Tamimi and Sebastianelli, 2017).  Nonetheless, there is no correlation between these ratings and the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is hard for firms to demonstrate the value of their ESG initiatives contribute 
directly to particular SDGs and objectives. (Khaled et al., 2021). 
Over the past ten years, there has been an increase in the amount of information shared regarding firms' environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) activities. This is due to the growing emphasis on sustainability issues (Conca et al., 
2021). The relevance of corporate responsibility for societal and environmental issues is highlighted by the expanding

Figure 7. Density visualizations of Scopus database using Vosviewer 
 
Figure 7 shows density visualization using Vosviewer, which indicates the depth of research studied in certain areas 
of ESG Performance. The density of items determines the appearance of keywords in the number represented by the 
color. The more concentrated colors indicate the research has grown in high numbers. Thus, we could notice the 
keyword with less frequent occurrence represented by un-concentrated color, which means the research topic is still 
limited that need more investigation for future study (potential topic). Some sample of these keywords such as 
responsible investment, stakeholder management, gri, disclosure, corporate social responsibility, social and 
governance. Thus, these research topics provide opportunities for researchers to identify the potential topic as a novel 
contribution to work in the area of ESG performance research. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study employs bibliometric analysis to review all literatures from the Scopus database in ESG performance 
research areas. ESG performance literature has increasingly raised each year which was marked by the number of 
publications in recent years. According to the result, at the initial result stage, obtained as much as 267 datasets from 
Scopus database. The result of this study shows the trends of ESG performance research, publication outlets (peer-
reviewed journals), contributing authors, and productive countries. The analysis of keywords with less frequent 
occurrence indicates the potential topics for future study as contribution of this study. Thus, this study also intended 
to notice research development and predict potential advancement in future research through bibliometric analysis 
because there has been a significant increase in ESG performance research. The Vosviewer application had been 
successfully demonstrated in mapping and visualizing the bibliometric data.  The limitation of this study is datasets 
only taken from Scopus database especially peer-reviewed journals as resources. Thus, we recommend that further 
research should use various electronic databases such as Web of Science (WoS), Springer, IEEE Xplore et cetera in 
order to get better scientific contributions.

Abstract 
This paper aims to explore the influence of BRI in CLMV countries and its implications for the process of ASEAN 
economic integration. ASEAN faces an economic development gap between ASEAN6 and the CLMV bloc that 
can be filled by China through various economic development schemes, including the Belt and Road Initiative 
(BRI). BRI can be a dilemma at various levels, but it can also be a stimulant to strengthen ASEAN economic 
integration. The characteristics of the ASEAN region that adheres to open regionalism or hybrid regionalism can 
be an advantage in economic integration through AEC, where economically, ASEAN member countries can freely 
determine the pattern of bilateral economic cooperation with virtually any country, but politically, the ASEAN 
Way principle can determine the pattern of political decision making at the regional level. Without the domination 
of a country in the region, all member countries will speak on behalf of the region if there is a political decision 
concerning the region. At this point, the tendency of sub-regionalism within ASEAN can be suppressed while still 
obtaining economic benefits. 
Keywords  
ASEAN6, CLMV, ASEAN integration, China, Belt and Road Initiative 
1. Introduction
The Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) is seen as an ambivalent initiative from China, both as an opportunity and as a 
challenge, domestically and regionally. In the ASEAN context, the BRI is a promising mechanism to facilitate 
future trade between ASEAN and China. BRI is considered capable of creating opportunities for ASEAN to 
strengthen its intra- and extra-regional economic relations (Foo et al, 2019). Regionally, ASEAN still grapples 
with the integration of the CLMV countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam) and the founding countries 
of ASEAN 1967 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), plus Brunei which joined in 1984 
(“ASEAN6”). These problems relate mainly to different historical aspects, which complicate the existence of a 
common ground as well as difference in unequal economic development (Soja, 2017). However, considering the 
fact that CLMV’s economic growth is quite competitive, CLMV has become a strategic “sub-region” in ASEAN 
economic integration (Global Data, 2021). Theoretically, sub-regionalism might serve as the possibility of being 
a stimulant for regional integration, but it might also open the opportunity to disrupt regional stability. Hence the 
issue. 
However, the economic obstacles of CLMV do not lie in their relatively excellent economic growth, but in the 
similarity of conditions such as an economy based on export of agricultural and light industry products, lack of 
significant natural resources, a high level of poverty and corrupt state bureaucracy (Soja, 2017). Soja also added, 
CLMV economies are constantly changing, and such economies transform into specific forms of free markets 
with limited state intervention but are not followed by democratization and recognition of civil rights in politics. 
It is at this point that the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) may pose a solution in the context of economic 
integration to fill gaps in order to realize ASEAN’s Vision. This trend of integration coincides with China’s global 
expansion through BRI. ASEAN is certainly a region that China will not sweep out off the radar in its global 
ambition of “China Era and an Asian Century”. Cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, technology and 
culture are being promoted comprehensively in accordance with the ASEAN target of eliminating gaps of 
inequality to realize comprehensive regional integration. 
Apart from the longstanding bilateral cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, in the regional context, the idea 
of comprehensive China-ASEAN cooperation has been in effect since the ratification of CAFTA (China-ASEAN 
Free Trade Area) in 2000 and effective in 2010. This cooperation is expected to strengthen China-ASEAN 
economic relations, where China demonstrates strong commitment upon its implementation. For example, with

countries to comply with the plans of the ruling state, so that the decision-making process becomes faster. 
Currently, ASEAN does not have the power to lead other countries in directing the integration process. Members 
respect ASEAN principles and refuse to put their country above other countries, because it is feared that such 
action will undermine the AEC integration process.  
 
According to Soong (2018), the existence of a strong and unified ASEAN is the key that determines the 
development of East Asian integration through ASEAN centrality, ASEAN centrality will encourage ASEAN to 
play a stronger role in dealing with larger global powers. In simple terms ASEAN centrality is a strategy that does 
not depend on any party, so that these conditions can ensure and enhance regional peace and stability. Politically, 
the ASEAN Way principles may serve as a mechanism to prevent the domination of a country in the ASEAN 
region. But on the other hand the ASEAN Way may serve as logic of domination related to political decisions that 
must be taken by this region. There is a positive side to this mechanism which prevents decision-making from 
being dominated by one of the strongest countries in the region. In other words, all decisions are joint decisions 
by consensus, with ASEAN as a single, unitary actor. Through this principle, ASEAN countries bilaterally can 
establish economic cooperation freely with China through any mechanism, but when speaking on behalf of the 
region, political decisions depend on how decisions play out in the region. At this point, if CLMV have increased 
political capacity, ASEAN6 will see it as a threat to the way of playing that has existed for a long time since the 
founding of ASEAN. However, the principles of the ASEAN Way were designed when ASEAN was founded in 
the first place. Suspicion of the non-democratic political system of the CLMV can be an obstacle to more total 
political integration.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper conducts an analysis at the domestic level of politics and the economy to identify the influence of BRI 
on the AEC. At the domestic level, BRI helps to realize the national interests of ASEAN members, especially 
CLMV. At the political level, China through BRI can stimulate ASEAN in forming a more effective decision-
making system to avoid decisions that harm ASEAN in AEC integration. However, in the case of ASEAN, the 
logic of decision-making differs from that of economic logic. Politically, there will always be a chasm between 
CLMV and ASEAN6 countries. countries in the CLMV can receive tremendous economic benefits from China. 
However, ASEAN6 will have their own decision-making logic at the intergovernmental level. As a consequence 
of regional integration based on government initiatives, not on the market, the processes that occur at the market 
level will be fully controlled by the governments of each member state. ASEAN6 is likely to maintain the 
dominance of decision-making by the founding countries of ASEAN and will continue to be wary of the steps 
taken by sub regional actors in decision-making at the supranational institutional level. The role as the founder of 
ASEAN will remain a conditio sine qua non in political decisions at the regional level. However, this can be seen 
as an ASEAN advantage that is able to harmonize the necessary economic dimensions, while maintaining the 
political pattern that has been going on so far. In this case, there is no need for an integral and institutional political 
mechanism as long as ASEAN’s security is not at stake, such as the EU. Due to various limitations, this dilemma 
cannot be resolved in this paper.

Abstract 
Autonomous vehicles are the future which can ensure safety and optimized use of infrastructure the world has. One 
of the key research areas in this domain is the development of controllers for the motion of the vehicle. The paper 
aims to design and compare the lateral and longitudinal controllers in a single model, designed in MATLAB. With 
the set of real-time input variables, the controller will generate a path, based on vehicle’s present position, orientation 
relative to the point ahead of the vehicles intended path and the required orientation along the path at a specific 
position. The model was able to simulate the various driving conditions and the scope of future work is also discussed. 
Such a model will be helpful for those who wants a base development project which can act as a reference to build 
the model, for further research and development.

1. Introduction
One of the rapid accelerations in the automotive industry is the research and development of autonomous vehicle (AV) 
which tend to a) reduce the severity of accidents, b) increase mobility for people with disabilities and the elderly, c) 
reduce pollution and d) use the infrastructure to the full potential. The concept of AV has started to be in passenger 
cars in the name of advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) for the past few years (Van et al., 2021). Humans 
experience distraction, fatigue and emotions while driving which causes 94% accidents as reported by the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). 
The Society of Automotive Engineers international standards define autonomous vehicle from Level 0 to Level 5. In 
Level 0 the driver takes full control while in Level 5 the vehicle takes full control. Currently, most vehicles on roads 
are equipped with Level 1 or Level 2 autonomy due to the fact that the sensor for AV posts a lot of limitations and 
high costs. The features that are now available includes emergency braking, lane keeping assist, blind spot monitoring 
and adaptive cruise control. The Figure 1 show a system level topology of an autonomous BEV model, having 
longitudinal control which consists of a drive cycle, controller, battery, power converter, traction motor and vehicle 
body. Since this is a closed loop system, feedback is necessary to the controller which forms the output characteristics 
of the vehicle. The drive cycle gives the velocity with respect to the time as input to the controller. An example of a 
such a drive cycle called the Modified Indian Drive Cycle is depicted by Figure 2. The controller is responsible for 
calculating the commands that shall be send to the motor according to the input drive cycle and the current state of the 
vehicle which it receives via the feedback loop from vehicle dynamics.

6. Conclusion
The model with both longitudinal and lateral control of the vehicle was successfully modelled, and the simulations 
were carried out. The two major test that was performed was the Constant Radius and Constant Speed tests. For each 
of the tests, definite path was defined at six different velocities. The developed model in MATLAB-Simulink is 
capable enough to simulate the lateral and longitudinal control of the vehicle. The model is designed, keeping a four-
wheeler in mind and the vehicle parameters were chosen according to it. The PI controller employed in this model is 
able to control the longitudinal motion of the vehicle under all conditions. 
The Stanley controller used to control the lateral movement of the ego vehicle is very effective at low speeds. But as 
the speed increases the lateral acceleration increases and the RMS error increases. At speeds above 30 kmph the error 
in current coordinates and reference coordinate sis way too much. The simulation tells us that the controller is capable 
of making vehicle follow the planned path and if we implement a logic which can reduce speeds at turns, the model 
is well suited to use for future simulations and research.

Abstract 
We are into the technology era which means we have to utilize the maximum power of computational engineering to 
improve the manufacturing goals of a company. In this paper we have proposed a theory which will discuss how we 
can achieve it by using the Time forecasting and Artificial Neural Network for predicting the possible outcomes in 
Production and sales. This will help the industry to be ready for all possibilities. As we assume that in the 
manufacturing industry Manpower is the key factor and if we predict the quantity of the production required to be 
produced for upcoming months then the manufacturing company will be ready with the raw material and manpower 
which means the accurate planning will increase the profitability of the company. This paper is the combination of 
ARIMA Model using time forecasting and artificial neural network algorithms to analyze annually the 
manufacturing process of a company using the three major domains of procurement, marketing and sales. This paper 
will focus on the technique of data forecasting by using the previous information about raw material, purchase and 
production. We will achieve this by combining two modules together to show the output and accuracy both modules 
are compared. We have proposed the ARIMA module for time forecasting with the combination of artificial neural 
network algorithms which will be used to make the possible predictions based on available data.

Abstract 
In recent years, the continuously growing municipal solid waste (MSW) has been a global concern due to 
growing urbanization, dynamic changes in the market, and the harmful impact of MSW on the 
environment. Hence, collecting the generated waste from different sources and transporting it to different 
disposal options is the beginning of achieving sustainability. To remain an environment-friendly, long-
term economically growing and social supportive system, ensuring the integration of sustainability in the 
collection and transportation (C&T) phase is of particular importance for the municipal solid waste 
management (MSWM) system. Thus, this paper identifies the critical success factor for sustainable C&T 
of the MSWM system for Indian cities. These factors are analyzed further to understand the relationship 
of one another and importance of the successful sustainable C&T through Interpretive Structural Modelling 
and Fuzzy-MICMAC. The findings will be helpful for decision-makers in making decision on adoption of 
these factors.

1. Introduction
In past decade, the exponentially growing generation of municipal solid waste (MSW) has been a global concern. 
Moreover, a complete system for handling MSW called Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) system 
comprises an implementation of several activities starting from collection and transportation, segregation, 
processing and disposal. It is estimated that in 2031 urban India will generate 450,132 tonnes per day (TPD) of 
MSW and 120 crores TPD in 2050, as against 147,613 TPD in 2020 due to urbanization (CPHEEO, 
2016;CPHEEO, 2017;MoHUA, 2020). India collected 50-80% of its generated MSW (Kaza et al.,2018). In India, 
43% of collected MSW is sent to landfills and 23% to treatment(CPCB, 2017) . The collection and transportation 
(C&T) account for 70% of the total cost based on the fuel price and geographical area. Furthermore, this amount 
exceeds 80% and 50% in low-income and middle-income countries, respectively. Thus, a minor change in 
investment will affect the economic and environmental dimensions (Morais et al.,2021). Since C&T of MSW is 
the first step towards the transformation of waste to valuables, there is a need to make decision carefully. This 
phase includes picking up waste from generators and transporting it to the transfer station or processing unit. 
Improper C&T practices tend to open dumping and littering of MSW, causes health risk to human beings and 
street animals, and impure the land and water, which deviate from the sustainable development goals (SDG) 
established by United Nations (Messerli et al.,2019). Thus, the integration of sustainability concept with C&T 
will provide a solution to these issues. A sustainable MSWM system encourages the waste back into the chain to 
be recycled, reused and reproduced. By visiting the MSWM unit and discussing with the stakeholders, the authors 
found that the concept of sustainability is far away from the present system. Thus, the current study encourages 
to find the critical success factors (CSF) for C&T phase of the MSWM system to be sustainable. In addition to 
CSF selection, efficient techniques are needed to analyze its impact on the system and make effective decision on 
the adoption of CSF. Past research has implemented several multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools to

4. Managerial Implication 
The current study contributes toward improving the existing knowledge in C&T phase of MSWM system through 
the ISM model. From the result of ISM hierarchy, the public pressure and sustainability awareness is the most 
influencing factor for achieving sustainability in the system. However, public pressure, sustainability awareness, 
strategies for the uncertainties and formalizing worker have high impact on the system’s improvement as resulted 
from Fuzzy MICMAC analysis. It allows the increase in awareness about the CSFs concerning the sustainability 
adoption in the Indian MSWM system. The identified direct and indirect interconnectedness among CSFs shapes 
the C&T phase related decisions. Moreover, knowledge on driving and dependence power will help the managers 
to understand the impact of CSF on system and implementation stage of CSF in Indian MSWM system.   
 
5. Conclusion and Future scope 
The initial step of MSWM is the C&T phase, which collect MSW for further processing. To protect environment, 
reduces the impact to society and economic growth, this study found CSF for sustainable C&T of MSWM system. 
These CSF were analyzed using ISM to interpret the inter-relationship among enablers and Fuzzy MICMAC to 
categorize CSF for analyzing its impact on system. Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis depicts the importance of driving 
and dependence power while making decisions. Moreover, result indicated that the implementation of these CSF 
would achieve some targets of sustainable development goals in C&T of MSWM system for Indian cities. The 
result of the study would be helpful for decision-makers to focus on the specific enablers and improvements for 
the same. Since, the primary input for the used technique is expert opinion, a biased opinion on the topic will 
affect the output of the system. The number of experts selected for the study is limited and therefore, could not be 
generalized to other sectors. Thus, identified CSFs can be tested for other sectors and other developing countries. 
Different mathematical modeling can be done for each CSF improvement. The developed model can be validated 
using in-depth case study and structural equation modelling.

Abstract 
The present work is carried out on modelling robotics and analysis of rocker bogie mechanisms used in the mars rovers 
the main purpose of this project is to overcome the rough terrains while maintaining stability. This enables to have a 
suspension-based mechanism that distributes the vehicle load as evenly as possible even on bumps and irregular 
surfaces. The modelling of rocker bogie mechanisms is carried out by CATIA V5R20 and analysis it with ANSYS 
19.2. A Rocker Bogie Mechanism is made completely from PVC pipe to increase its capability to withstand shock 
Vibration and mechanical failures. An android application is developed in order to communicate with the Arduino on 
the rover and can control the rover with mobile application. The important factor in manufacturing of rocker bogie 
mechanism is to determine the dimensions of rocker bogie linkages and angle between them. The lengths and angles 
of this mechanism can be changed as per requirement.

1. Introduction
Rocker bogie is a six wheeled vehicle which runs on motor, this rover is capable to move on terrain surfaces and to 
overcome obstacles. It is provided with six wheels which are supported by each other while overcoming obstacles. The 
design has no springs or stub axles for each wheel, allowing the rover to climb over obstacles, such as rocks, that are 
up to twice the wheel's diameter in size while keeping all six wheels on the ground. As with any suspension system, the 
tilt stability is limited by the height of the centre of gravity. Systems using springs tend to tip more easily as the loaded 
side yields. This rocker bogie system reduces the motion of the main Mars Exploration Rover (MER) vehicle body by 
half compared to other suspension systems. Each of the rover's six wheels has an independent motor. The two front and 
two rear wheels have individual steering motors which allow the vehicle to turn in place. Each wheel also has cleats, 
providing grip for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks. The maximum speed of the robots operated in this 
way is limited to eliminate as many dynamic effects as possible so that the motors can be geared down, thus enabling 
each wheel to individually lift a large portion of the entire vehicle. The term rocker comes from the rocking aspect of 
the larger links on each side of the suspension system. These rockers are connected to each other and the vehicle chassis 
through a differential. Relative to the chassis, when one rocker goes up, the other goes down. The chassis maintains the 
average pitch angle of both rockers. One end of a rocker is fitted with a drive wheel and the other end is pivoted to a 
bogie. The term bogie refers to the links that have a drive wheel at each end. Bogies were commonly used as load 
wheels in the tracks of army tanks as idlers distributing the load over the terrain. Bogies were also quite commonly used 
on the trailers of semi-trailer trucks. Both applications now prefer trailing arm suspensions. Based on the centre of mass, 
the Curiosity rover of the Mars Science Laboratory mission can withstand a tilt of at least 45 degrees in any direction 
without overturning, but automatic sensors limit the rover from exceeding 30-degree tilts. The system is designed to be 
used at slow speed of around 10 centimetres per second (3.9 in/s) so as to minimize dynamic shocks and consequential 
damage to the vehicle when surmounting sizable obstacles. In order to go over a vertical obstacle face, the front wheels 
are forced against the obstacle by the centre and rear wheels. The rotation of the front wheel then lifts the front of the 
vehicle up and over the obstacle. The middle wheel is then pressed against the obstacle by the rear wheels and pulled 
against the obstacle by the front until it is lifted up and over. Finally, the rear wheel is pulled over the obstacle by the 
front two wheels.

5. Conclusions and future research 
In   this   thesis   work   we   have   analyzed   the   six wheeled rocker-bogie rover. The Kinematics of the rover is 
presented in detail  and  quasi-static  force  analysis  is  also done  for  the  rover  for  planar  case. The   rover   is   
simulated   over   various   uneven terrains and the performance of the rover is analyzed over flat, slope, step  and  
ditch  profile  of  surface.  The results of simulation show  that  rover  crosses  flat and  slope  profiles.In  case  of  step  
profile  only  front  wheel  crosses  the  step, when middle wheel hit the step the velocity becomes zero and it is not 
able to climb. In case of ditch profile also only front wheel crosses the  ditch,  when  middle  wheel  hit  the up  of  
ditch  the  velocity  goes  to  zero  and  it  is  not  able  to climb.

Abstract 
Energy is the most basic and essential need for all living things on the planet. Energy is the driving force behind 
any country's economic development. In today's world, conventional energy sources produce the majority of 
energy. However, the world's population is growing at an alarming rate, and conventional energy sources are 
becoming scarce. This paper harvests energy from a speed breaker by arranging gears and employing electronic 
devices. Saving a lot of money allows for the generation of a large amount of electricity. and, if implemented, will 
be extremely beneficial to the government. When a vehicle is in motion, it generates various forms of energy due 
to friction between the vehicle's wheel and the road, i.e., a rough surface. Heat energy is also produced when a 
fast-moving vehicle collides with the wind. Potential Energy to Electrical Energy Conversion is the principle at 
work. A power production system exists that converts the potential energy created by a vehicle moving up on a 
speed breaker into kinetic energy. The vehicle gains height as it moves over the inclined plates, increasing the 
potential energy wasted in a conventional rumble strip. When the breaker is tripped, they crank a lever attached to 
a ratchet-wheel mechanism, an angular motion converter, which rotates a geared shaft loaded with recoil springs. 
The shaft’s output is connected to a dynamo, which converts kinetic energy into electricity.

1. Introduction
Many people in India are affected by a shortage of clean and reliable energy sources such as electricity. Around 
1000 million people in India continue to rely on traditional biomass energy sources such as fuel, wood, 
agricultural waste, and livestock dung for cooking and other home requirements. agricultural waste, and livestock 
dung for cooking and other home requirements. Electricity is necessary at every point in our everyday lives, and 
population expansion has resulted in a reduction in conventional energy sources. Many more helpful power 
generation strategies have arisen as a result of the great growth of technology and familiarity with them. Figure 1 
shows power generation in India by each sector. The newly developed techniques are concerned with cost- 
effectiveness. This research report outlines one such method of electricity generation.

5. Results and Discussion  
 
 Any vehicle going over the speed breaker has a mass of 300Kg (Approximately) 
 15 cm is the height of the speed brake. 
 Work done = body weight multiplied by vehicle distance travelled 
 Here, Body Weight = 300 Kg x 9.81 
= 2943 N 
 The distance travelled by the body matches the height of the speed breaker, which is 15cm. 
 Work done per second = (2943 x 0.15)/60 = 7.3575 Watts 
 Power developed for a single- vehicle travelling at high speeds in a Breaker arrangement for one minute 
= 7.3575 watts 
 The power produced in 60 minutes (1 hour) = 441.45 watts

This mechanism of rotary motion is created by converting reciprocating motion into rotary motion (Figure 13). 
Rotational power (i.e., mechanical energy) is transformed into electrical energy by utilizing a gear arrangement and 
a generator that generates electricity. And the electricity generated can be put to use in a variety of ways. When we 
consider a speed breaker height of 10 cm and a 1500 kg car crossing the speed breaker, we can generate a 
significant amount of power. For one minute, this equates to 24.52 W of power. Thus, an hour generates 
approximately 1.47 kW of power, which adds up to 35.31 kW of power per day. This equates to a large value and is 
sufficient to power 4-6 street lights per day. 
 
 
6. Future Scope 
 If implemented, it will greatly contribute to energy generation, lowering the burden on power plants and making 
more electrical equivalents available for industry, resulting in the nation's progressive development. 
 
7. Conclusions  
This sort of power generation has been identified as being less expensive than many other choices, and the model 
has less parts, thus assembly would be very cheap with all of the components readily available and no model-
specific parts manufactured. This type of electricity generation aids in the conservation of conventional resources by 
generating electricity from readily available renewable natural resources.

This method can generate electricity without relying on other factors and can meet the high demands of the future. It 
is also a non- harmful process for the environment. There is also no impediment to traffic flow. There is no need for 
manpower resources in this case because it is automatic.  
This has many applications, such as street lights and traffic lights, which prevent accidents from occurring 
""Electricity is a need in our daily existence."" This power generation mechanism is yet another creative approach to 
creating green power to boost the country's development by better utilizing available resources. Because of the 
population explosion, current power generation is no longer adequate to meet our needs. 
As the countries and the world's electricity demand rise in the coming days, it will be a great boon to the country and 
the world, as it will save a lot of electricity from powerplants that are currently being wasted in illuminating street 
lights.  
This research can be used to help our country develop by improving and more effectively utilizing its resources. A 
country's development is directly proportional to how well and efficiently it uses its power supply. This is the time 
to put these creative ideas into action. This concept provides an alternative and contributes to the country's economy. 
Every country's development is the development of the world.

Abstract 
A mutual fund is the safest way to invest because it is less hazardous than other options and offers higher returns 
than a fixed deposit. Investments serve a variety of purposes. Equity mutual funds provide stability and moderate to 
high returns; some may invest for a specific lockup period for high gains, while others invest for a lifetime 
retirement; mutual funds have various purposes. The research focuses on the impact of Covid-19 on individual

1. Introduction
Investment may be defined as the process of collection of assets to gain profits from the investment over some time. 
An investment may be a purchase of shares, property, or corporate bonds which in return provide profits that are 
useful in the future. There are many types of investments like shares, bonds, real estate Mutual funds, etc. 
A mutual fund is an investment fund where the money is collected from the investors, and the public which is then 
pooled and used to buy Government securities, bonds, invest in shares, and money market instruments. Mutual 
funds are completely managed by professional fund managers. A mutual fund is a low-cost scheme that is 
professionally managed and allows investing in a diversified portfolio this is the reason why mutual funds are very 
suitable for every common man. There are thousands of mutual funds every mutual fund comes with its objective 
and investment strategy and when compared to banks they almost manage same amount or more than the banks. The 
mutual fund acts as a link between the investors and the securities market by investing the investor's money in 
capital and money market and helping them in generating good returns. 
The mutual fund industry in India originated in the year 1963 with the help of the unit trust of India (UTI) and the 
initiative was taken by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India). In India SBI mutual fund was the first non-UTI mutual 
fund.

into tax-saving and growth funds. This suggests that the SBI mutual fund need to put in more effort in order 
to educate investors about potential earnings their plans' potential 
• 
An important factor in investing in mutual funds is education. High-caliber individuals use the internet to 
find the information. Their methods of gathering information vary from additional surveyors. SBI Mutual 
fund provider should regularly update their websites. 
• 
To meet the diverse needs of investors during at times like pandemic, covid-19, SBI mutual fund should 
introduce fresh, creative programmes. There aren't many cutting-edge items on the market. The ability of 
individuals to invest must be investigated by SBI Mutual Fund Company. They should develop creative 
programmes to meet the needs of retail investors as awareness of capital markets among retail investors 
grows. 
• 
SBI Mutual Fund Company should send out their annual reports to investors in a timely manner so that 
they are aware of the company's financial situation. Knowing the status of their investment will assist the 
investor make future plans. 
• 
To address the investment demands of various categories during covid-19 like situations, SBI Mutual Fund 
Company should produce a variety of products with various risk-return combinations. 
 
7. Conclusion 
In India, the mutual fund business has grown tremendously, attracting investors from all walks of life, including 
middle-class families with low-risk tolerance. Mutual funds offer superior returns, and security, and also serve as a 
form of savings. There are many ways to invest in the financial markets, but according to investor comments, mutual 
funds offer guaranteed and safe returns on investments. Investors are aware of the advantages of investing in mutual 
funds. 
 
SBI mutual fund firms should come forward to fully support investors at times like COVID-19 by providing 
advisory services, and extra suggestions, also assisting them in portfolio design, comprehending different mutual 
fund schemes, and promoting such types to ensure investor happiness. The SBI bank should educate people about 
the economic scenario and help them grasp the facts given in various schemes so that investors can assess the risks 
linked with the funds they are participating in and the investment decisions they are making. This may assist the SBI 
mutual fund company in attracting more investors and the mutual fund industry in achieving new heights. 
 
During crises such as pandemics, investors should identify the risks, return levels, and make decisions based on 
professionals rather than panicking, as this will help them earn greater returns and ensure the safety of their 
investments.

Abstract 
Agriculture is the major livelihood of most of the farmers in Karnataka especially rural people. Crop insurance 
schemes were created to help farmers reduce their losses. It offers financial assistance and encouragement to crop loss 
farmers, the loss caused by natural disasters, pests, and diseases. The PMFBYS attempts to lower farmers’ premium 
burdens while also ensuring timely fulfilment of crop insurance claims for the full insured value. This study focuses 
on the impact of PMFBYS on three insurance companies with special reference during covid -19. The study is 
conducted to know the detailed study of PMFBYS in Karnataka. The analysis is done with the support of secondary 
data and quantitative research by considering three variables Number of Farmers enrolled, the number of farmers 
benefited, and the Claim amount settled. To know the performances of the insurance companies panel data regression 
model have been estimated with three different models that are pooled OLS, fixed and random effect regression model, 
to find which estimation is the best significate fit for each insurance company. Comparison has been made between 
the companies and concludes showing which companies have been impacted by PMFBYS on insurance companies 
during covid -19 and which insurance companies’ performance is better during covid-19.

1. Introduction
Agriculture is the major livelihood of most of Karnataka's rural people. Karnataka’s GSDP (Gross State Domestic 
Product) is at 5th rank and 15% of its contribution is made by the agricultural sector.  GSDP has grown to 9.5% in the 
year 2021-2022. When it comes to economic growth, the government as a whole showed a strong interest in 
agricultural sector development. Agriculture development must be prioritized for the economy to be sustainable. It 
must be high on the government's priority list. Governments have previously taken numerous steps to increase 
productivity, change and modify cropping patterns, evolve agricultural services, evolve agricultural seeds, expand 
irrigation facilities and technologies, simply take agricultural credit, and provide farmers with support in the form of 
a minimum price on all crops. (Rai, 2019).

In the test, the p-value is 0.0203 which is less than the 5%
•
Fixed effect model is appropriate
From the analysis of Hausman test if p-values is less than 5% the null hypothesis is rejected and accept the alternative 
hypothesis thus, the fixed effect model is appropriate to measure the performance of Future Generali GIC 
From the above results of three insurance companies AIC, Bharti AXA GIC and Future Generali GIC 
The AIC’s performance was good during covid-19 
The Bharti AXA GIC’s performance is moderate during Covid-19 
Future Generali GIC’s performance was better compared to AIC and Bharti AXA GIC during covid-19 in Karnataka. 
5. Conclusion
The study primarily focused on the performance of crop insurance schemes; the study analysed and evaluated farmer 
awareness. The study discovered that farmers in Karnataka only recently learned about crop insurance schemes 
available in the state, despite the fact that agriculture has been practiced in Karnataka since time immemorial. Crop 
insurance is performing reasonably well in Karnataka. Agriculture plays a crucial role for the betterment of the 
economy. Crop insurance schemes were created to help farmers reduce their losses. It offers financial assistance and 
encouragement to crop loss, the loss caused by natural disasters, pests, and diseases. So, many schemes have been

Abstract 
In the present scenario, drones are the ruling technology. But their usage has been limited because of their high cost. 
This work aims to fabricate a low-cost UAV Quadcopter system with face recognition for surveillance. The 
Quadcopter is controlled by a radio transmitter. The surveillance system used consists of an FPV camera, an FPV 
transmitter, and a receiver. Face recognition is done using OpenCV in python with the help of the Local Binary Pattern 
Histogram (LBPH) algorithm. The fabricated Quadcopter is capable of identifying a targeted person from a certain 
range.

1. Introduction
In the olden days, Surveillance is done by humans. Later on, CC Cameras came into the picture. As the technology is 
getting updated, Surveillance drones are slowly introduced into the market. The updated features like face recognition 
make drones capable of fulfilling many of the day-to-day applications like traffic density monitoring, Food delivery, 
etc. Sǎrǎcin, et al (Sǎrǎcin et al., 2017) proposed multiple ways of quickly recharging a drone to keep a surveillance 
drone running continuously in air. Pirotta, et al (Pirotta et al., 2022) discussed the applications of drones for monitor 
marine as well as wildlife.

6. Conclusion 
The Quadcopter for surveillance with face recognition is helpful in the identification of targeted people in situations 
like search and rescue operations, remote areas, military purposes, etc., and it can also increase the security at remote 
locations. The main outcome of the study is to fabricate a cost-effective quadcopter drone with face recognition as 
additional functionality. The Local Binary Pattern Histogram Algorithm offers a greater accuracy level with lower 
complexity and the level of detection of the face is fast.

Abstract 
The current economic scenario of various countries across the world are hugely suffered from the set back issues 
such as War incidents, global recession, downward trend of economic growth and uncertainty caused due to 
COVID-19. The outlook for growth and inflation are both at risk from lingering conflict and sanctions, high oil 
and commodity prices, protracted supply-chain disruptions, amplified global financial market volatility resulting 
from monetary policy changes in major economies and new COVID-19 outbreaks in India. During 2021–2022, 
excess liquidity conditions and the external benchmark-based pricing of variable rate loans significantly improved 
monetary transmission. The bulk of the industries saw an increase in interest rates on existing loans. With the 
support of conventional and unconventional liquidity measures, RBI has supported the banks to maintain orderly 
market conditions while boosting mood on the financial markets. In view of the existing scenario, the research 
paper critically examines the trends in instruments used by RBI to control the flow of deposits and money 
circulation among the banks with a main aim to reduce the negative effects of economic down turn.  In this paper, 
an attempt is made to evaluate the impact of financial instruments of RBI on Indian Economy.  The paper further 
examines the influence of the select instruments (i.e., Repo Rate, Reverse Repo Rate, Cash Reserve Ratio) on 
Inflation rate, GDP and Unemployment rate.  The study is descriptive research oriented.  Secondary sources of 
data extracted from RBI; World Bank data holds major part of the present research paper.

1. Introduction
India has a broad financial industry that is rapidly growing due to both the expansion of already-existing financial 
services companies and the entry of new players. Commercial banks, Insurance firms, Non-Banking Financial 
Institutions, co-operatives, Pension funds, Mutual funds, and other smaller financial organizations forms the 
sector. The banking regulator recently permitted the creation of new organizations, like Payment Banks, 
expanding the variety of organizations operating in the market. The Statistics of RBI reveals that Commercial 
banks make up more than 64% of the total assets held by the Financial System, making the Indian financial sector 
primarily a banking sector. By 2028, India is anticipated to rank as the fourth-largest private wealth market 
worldwide. 
India's economy is currently among the most dynamic in the world because, to its thriving of banking and 
insurance industries. The Financial Services Industry responded favorably to the loosening of foreign investment 
regulations, with many corporations announcing plans to raise their interests in joint ventures with Indian firms. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) claims that the Banking Industry in India is adequately capitalized and well-
regulated. The nation has significantly better financial and economic circumstances than any other nation in the 
world. Studies on credit, market, and liquidity risk indicate that Indian banks are generally robust and have fared 
well during the global recession.

6. Conclusion 
The Indian economy has been slightly impacted by RBI operating choices. A country's economy is greatly 
impacted by the repo rate because it is crucial to controlling the market's cash flow. Depending on market liquidity 
and inflation cash flow, the Indian monetary policy controls and regulates the repo rate. Additionally, the repo 
rate directly influences banks' ability to borrow money. As the repo rate rises, banks' borrowing capacity 
decreases, which lowers industries' production capacity and raises the cost of essential products and services while 
also increasing unemployment. Repo rates play a significant part in regulating inflation in the nation. For instance, 
if there is high inflation, the RBI will raise the repo rate, which will reduce the amount of currency flowing through 
the market. As cash flow declines, investment and manufacturing capacity also decline, which lowers the inflation 
rate. Banks are encouraged to borrow money from RBI since, on the other hand, RBI only cuts the repo rate when 
the inflation rate declines.The repo rates of RBI and the interest rates on loans of commercial banks are 
proportional to each other If the repo rates get increased interest rates on loans to get Increased and vice versa. 
Reverse repo rate increases encourage commercial banks to deposit more money with the RBI, hence limiting the 
quantity of money accessible in the market. A rise in the reverse repo rate will cause the money supply to decline,

and vice versa. The growth rate of India has dropped as a result of the rise in Repo and Reverse Repo, while the 
inflation rate has climbed and the unemployment rate has improved.

Abstract 
Bridges are important elements in any transportation system. As bridges are vital links, they are required to be 
functional even after an earthquake to provide access to hospitals, fire stations, and a variety of other important 
services. This paper introduces the seismic analysis of the cantilever steel bridge of main span of 150 m long and 
50m, 50m of sub-spans and carriage way of 3 lanes and having width of 15 m. In this paper we will carry out 
response spectrum analysis of the cantilever steel bridge in MIDAS civil software.

1. Introduction
The bridge is called cantilever bridge when it is built using cantilevers, structure which is projected horizontally 
into space and supported on only one end. Large cantilever bridges are designed to for long bridges, rail traffic 
bridge using truss made from structural steel and box sections. When it was initially used, the steel truss cantilever 
bridge represented a significant advance in engineering because it could span over 460m and could be built more 
readily at tricky crossings because it required little to no falsework. 
In the current situations there is huge use of steel as structural members of the bridges. This is because steel offers 
large number of advantages compared to other construction materials. Constructions using steel as structural 
members offers easiness in fabrication, high strength and ductility and speed in construction (Figure 1).

1.1 Response Spectrum Analysis 
This is a general technique where the structure is dynamically analysed to determine the first and higher modes 
of vibration. It is ideal for more complex structural systems (e.g., continuous bridges, bridges with substantial 
differences in pier heights, bridges with curved plans, etc.). It depicts the maximum reaction of fictitious systems 
with one degree of freedom over a range of times to an earthquake with a given value of damping. 
The maximal response, which can be defined as the highest absolute acceleration, highest relative velocity, or 
highest relative displacement, is plotted versus the undamped natural period and for different damping values.

4.3 Deflection of the Bridge 
 For the deflection check of the bridge according to IRC 24:2010, Rolled steel beams, plate girders or lattice 
girders, either simple or continuous spans, shall be designed so that the total deflection due to live load and impact 
shall not exceed of 1/800 of the span.

4.4 Discussion 
Construction of the cast in situ concrete bridge takes too much time and for long span bridge they are difficult to 
construct. Cable stayed bridges can be useful for long span but in cable stayed bridges deflection in pylon is big 
issue. In case of long span, cantilever steel bridges are good because member to member erection is easy. Two 
side spas are manufactured in the factory and directly placed on piers. So, the cantilever steel truss bridge 
economical and the quick replacement to other type of bridges. 
 Conclusion 
Bridges are important elements in any transportation system. As bridges are vital links, they are required to be 
functional even after an earthquake to provide access to hospitals, fire stations, and a variety of other important 
services. This paper introduces the seismic analysis of the cantilever steel bridge of main span of 150 m long and 
50m, 50m of sub-spans and carriage way of 3 lanes and having width of 15 m. In this paper we will carry out 
response spectrum analysis of the cantilever steel bridge in MIDAS civil software.

Abstract 
Pipe racks are important part of Industrial Structures such as oil refineries, petrochemical sector, as they are used to 
support piping systems that transports fluids from one place to the other. The aim of this study is to carry out Linear 
Dynamic Analysis of Ethanol gas plant pipe rack considering coupled and decoupled case (for both pipe empty and 
operating conditions), using ANSYS and validating with Staad Pro. While analyzing pipe rack generally, the point 
masses calculated due to the weight of piping system and fluid are applied on the pipe rack structure, which usually 
satisfies the seismic mass criteria, but the stiffness added due to piping system and their supports are been neglected. 
The effect on seismic demand of Pipe rack, due to additional masses and stiffness of piping system have been checked. 
It is observed that in coupled case the modal frequencies of the structure is higher due to additional pipe stiffness, but 
at the same time base shear values are lower as compared to decoupled case, which can further direct towards the 
change in response reduction factor (R) for both the cases which may eventually result in reduced base shear values.  
Keywords 
 Pipe rack, piping system, Linear Dynamic analysis, coupled and decoupled case and response reduction factor. 
1. Introduction
The pipe rack is typically constructed from frames in steel or concrete and the pipeline assembles on top of it. Such 
pipe rack systems should be critically designed for seismic forces, as failure of non- structural components may cause 
damage to the nearby units. The accidents in chemical plants are recurrent and occur frequently exposing human lives 
and environment at danger (Sarno and Karagiannakis 2020). IS code 1893-part 4 2015 deals with these type of 
Industrial Structures and, recommends to carry modal analysis with all the stiffness of lateral as well as vertical load 
resisting members and masses of the structure modelled for calculating natural time period and linear dynamic analysis 
for analysis and design purpose. Equipment structure interaction is required to be considered for flexibly mounted 
equipment if ratio of masses of secondary structure (piping system or equipment) and primary structure (steel or RCC 
frame) exceeds 0.25. In this study 2 different cases are considered, case I where pipe rack are only modelled and load 
of piping system is applied in form of point loads (decoupled case for both empty and operating loading conditions) 
and case II where both pipe and pipelines are modelled considering the supporting conditions. Pushover analysis is 
carried out in Staad Pro in order to calculate response reduction factors for both the cases. 
1.1 Objectives 
•
To Perform Time History Analysis of pipe rack on ANSYS and validation of results using Staad-Pro.
•
Comparative study of seismic response for coupled and decoupled case.
•
Evaluating Response reduction factor for both Coupled and Decoupled case.

 
R = Rµ * Rs * R𝑅𝑅 = 1.119*7.96*0.71 = 6.31 
 
With reference to the above calculation value of R factor is greater for coupled case, due to increased stiffness. 
 
7. Conclusion 
In this study, an ethanol gas pipe rack was modelled, considering coupled and decoupled models, whose weight ratio 
exceeded 0.25 as per the clause given in IS 1893 part 4, for such structures both secondary (pipelines) and primary 
(pipe rack) are needed to be modelled. Here in this study four models were analyzed in ANSYS and Staad Pro, 
considering coupled and decoupled case for both empty and operating condition, and Pushover analysis was carried 
out in Staad Pro for evaluating response reduction factor.   
 
The main findings of this case study are as follows: 
In case of coupled model for both empty and operating conditions modal frequencies value increased by 35% as 
compared to decoupled case, this is mainly due to increased stiffness added because of pipelines and its support 
boundary conditions.  
 
It was also observed that the values of base shear for coupled cases was reduced considerably (9% in X direction and 
43% in Z direction), which can further direct towards the change in response reduction factor (R) for both the cases 
which may eventually reduce base shear values.  
Pushover analysis was carried out to evaluate response reduction factor in Z direction, which resulted in giving higher 
(R) factor for coupled case in respective direction. Maximum roof displacement was observed in decoupled case 
(operating condition) but was within permissible limits. The results show that considering dynamic interaction while 
modelling and analysis of such structure is important as added stiffness and masses may affect the seismic response 
of the structure.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the general population to remain indoors, since the government ordered a 
national lockdown on March 15, 2020, because of the rising cases in the country. Amidst the lockdown, citizens were 
still required to do their jobs and studies at home. This resulted in numerous ergonomic problems and discomforts 
since not all Filipinos have a decent workstation in their respective houses. The conducted research observes the 
ergonomic- based risk factors with the perceived risk of COVID-19, specifically about the residents of Paranaque 
City. A study from Davis et al (2020) discusses the different setups of employees that were analyzed by experienced 
ergonomics, and it showed that some employees have very poor ergonomics such as having non-adjustable chairs and 
wrong positioning of monitors, etc. The researchers have applied a quantitative research design to gather the 
necessary data to prove the hypothesis. Online surveys were used to acquire data from the residents, the medium used 
for the research are social media applications. The data gathered suggests that most respondents are aged 20 and 
below, had attended high school, were primarily students, office clerks, etc. The results show that a significant 
number of residents from the Paranaque area feels at risk of getting COVID-19. It was also concluded that most of the 
respondents were concerned for their family’s safety. Research conducted by Mertens et al (2020) also shows that a 
large percentage of people are worried that their loved ones might get infected with COVID-19.

1. Introduction
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, workers were forced to change their mode of work. Their jobs were required to 
perform their jobs remotely. But even after all this, there is still a huge number of COVID-19 cases. One possible 
factor is the ergonomics of the worker’s environment. There are three areas of ergonomics that is included in the 
study, these are Physical, Cognitive, and Macro-ergonomics. The Physical area of ergonomics is concerned with 
workplaces and workstations since it affects the physical aspect of a worker. This area is interested in the 
physiological, anatomical, anthropometric, and biomechanical aspects of humans. Larrea-Araujo, et.al (2021) 
concluded that several musculoskeletal disorders can be developed when having a poor physical ergonomic

Abstract 
The present paper illustrates a buckling characteristics study on composite light weight lattice structure called as 
IsoTruss. Finite element modelling and simulation is carried out to observe the buckling characteristics of IsoTruss. 
Comparison of compressive buckling load carrying capacity is done for different bay lengths and different diameters 
of IsoTruss. The result from this study concludes that the IsoTruss with same diameter yields maximum critical 
buckling load when global and local buckling is observed simultaneously. For maximum critical buckling load bay 
length decreases with increase in diameter of isotruss.  
Keywords 
IsoTruss, Bay length, Helical members, Longitudinal members, Carbon fibre, Local buckling, and global buckling. 
1. Introduction
As technology progresses in the field of structures the demand for light weight and high strength materials increasing 
rapidly and one of the solutions for it is a composite material. From two or more constituent materials a composite 
material is produced. Physical and chemical properties of composite material differ from the constituent materials. 
These properties also differ with the proportion of constituent materials. 
IsoTruss is one of the light wight trusses. Its geometry is made up of longitudinal and helical composite material tows 
such as carbon fiber with epoxy coating. IsoTruss is a lattice structure which is manufactured by interweaving of 
different numbers of longitudinal and helical members. Bending and compressive loads are carried by longitudinal 
members, while helical members could be designed for torsion loads. 
1.1 Geometry of IsoTruss 
Longitudinal tows:  These are the tows which are placed parallel to longitudinal axis of isotruss. Helical tows: From 
bottom end of each longitudinal tow, two helical elements start. One of these goes in clockwise direction and another 
goes in anticlockwise direction (Figure 1a, 1b, Figure 2). These helical elements forms tetrahedron geometry while 
crossing each other.   Bay length: In longitudinal direction same geometry is repeated at fixed length of IsoTruss. The 
length between these points of IsoTruss is called as bay length. (i.e., the distance between two consecutive peaks of 
tetrahedrons in longitudinal direction is considered as bay length.) 
Depending upon the number of longitudinal and helical tows to form the IsoTruss structure, it is named as 6 node 
IsoTruss, 8 node Isotruss etc. 6 Node geometry is the simplest form of IsoTruss, which comprises of double triangular 
cross-section geometry with six longitudinal tows and twelve helical tows. Eight node geometry is comprising of two 
squares placed at 45° to each other.

By keeping the same number of longitudinal elements if diameter of isotruss is increased then it’s moment of inertia 
get increased but the distance between the longitudinal elements increases so isotruss is more likely to fail by local 
buckling. 
6. Conclusions
For same element diameter isotruss with smaller diameter fails in global buckling   and with larger diameter fails in 
local buckling. For higher bay lengths isotruss fails in local buckling. Isotruss with same diameter yields maximum 
critical buckling load when global buckling observed. From the results it can be concluded that for maximum critical 
buckling load, bay length will decrease with increase in diameter of isotruss.

Abstract 
This study aims to empirically discover the effects of different light levels on college students' cognitive performance. 
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, most universities, schools, and other educational institutions have halted classes and 
activities in response. They have been forced to shift from face-to-face to online learning and significantly impact 
students' daily lives, particularly those who began their first year of college entirely online. Many students spend much of 
their time in their bedroom, which now has their classroom, where they join virtual classes, study, and do coursework. 
Our moods and cognitive capacities, such as learning and productivity, are strongly influenced by lighting. The researchers 
used data from a sample of 100 respondents obtained from a digital survey questionnaire containing a modified lighting 
ergonomics tool from the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety (CCOHS). Sixty-nine percent (69%) of 
participants ages 18 to 24 years old, ranging from Year 1 to 4, prefer studying at night. Regression analysis was used to 
determine if there are effects of light used by the students on their preferred time to study. The day and night sections 
were separated, but both results rejected the alternative hypothesis. The Pearson Correlation has determined the linear 
relationships between factors. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed no significant differences in the light levels 
used during daytime and nighttime. The researchers recommend exploring and considering other factors and including 
employees in work-from-home set-ups.

1. Introduction
Light has influenced human evolution. Humans have evolved an internal clock that is timed to the earth's 24-hour light-
dark rotating cycle under natural sunlight conditions (Czeisler et al., 1999). Numerous variables can affect 
environments, and also environments have influenced people directly. People are healthier and more energized in well-
designed surroundings and simultaneously. Buildings are one of these elements engaged with colors, lighting, outdoor 
views, and furnishing are all included in the construction and shape. Understanding the interaction between lighting and 
the environment might support industry professionals, or developers create good interior designs (Oneworkpalce, 1999). 
According to studies, daylight influences people's moods, productivity, and well-being, especially children and 
institutions. ""Light has been the most significant environmental contribution to biological functioning."" Meanwhile, 
artificial lighting replaces daylight, and this modern generation's culture is subjected to far more fluorescent lighting than 
natural light. For several years, fluorescent bulbs have been the go-to choice for schools seeking energy efficiency and 
improved lighting. It has developed to include full-spectrum bulbs that resemble daylight. LEDs (light-emitting diodes) 
have rapidly risen to prominence due to their reliability, endurance, and ability to bring a continuous, smooth, and 
uninterrupted spectrum (Morrow, 2018). The current study looked at how

The researchers utilized regression to determine if light effects are used on the preferred time to study, which is 
nighttime, on the factors: concentration, productivity, memorization, eye strain, and the number of hours studied. The 
results demonstrate that all factors were found to have a p-value greater than 0.05, making them insignificant. As a 
result, the alternative hypothesis is rejected since regression analysis shows that the different light levels have no 
significant effect on the varying factors. R-squared is the percentage of the dependent variable variation that a linear 
model explains. Higher r-squared represents smaller differences between the observed data and the fitted values. In this 
case, the r-squared is at 9.84% or 0.0984, indicating a non-linear relationship between the dependent and the 
independent variables. Additionally, the regression equation and summary are shown below.

5. Conclusion 
Light is essential for humans to live in this world. Different brightness ranges may give humans comfort or discomfort, 
resulting in various serious irreversible health conditions. With the pandemic, students and employees had to adapt to the 
concept of online learning and work from home set-ups. The rise of ergonomically- designed equipment for a work area 
emerged through the years, but not many people have considered lighting. The study's main objective is to determine 
whether different light levels: Low, Medium, High, and Very High can affect a student's cognitive performance: 
Concentration, Memorization, Productivity, and Perception. The researchers disseminated a digital survey to 100 
respondents of college students and were able to gather data that was analyzed using different statistical treatment tools. 
Sixty-nine percent (69%) of participants ages 18 to 24 years old, ranging from Year 1 to 4, prefer studying at night. The 
Pearson Correlation has determined that the number of hours a student has allocated for studying has an intermediate 
positive linear relationship with the usage of light and eye strain and a negative linear relationship with productivity. 
The type of light used had also shown a negative linear relationship with productivity and intermediate positive with eye 
strain. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed no significant differences in the different light levels used during 
daytime and nighttime. Lastly, Regression analysis was used to determine if there are effects of light used by the students 
on their preferred time to study. Day and Night sections were separated, but both results rejected the alternative 
hypothesis, which states that there are significant factors affecting college students' cognitive performance in relation to 
the different light levels.

6. Recommendation 
The researchers would like to explore and consider other factors such as room color, the color of the light bulb, and the age 
of the light bulb to fully determine any significant effects of different light levels used by the students in their set-ups. 
Future researchers can also include work-from-home employees in their study to determine whether different light 
settings affect their productivity and cognitive skills. This paper has tackled eye strain as an effect of varying light 
levels. Future researchers can also consider other health effects if they wish to delve deeper into the different effects of 
light levels. The rise of LED light strips has also taken off this pandemic. Future researchers can focus on or include this 
in their studies since not all light settings are healthy for the eyes. It does its purpose for aesthetics, but researchers can 
investigate if this improves the productivity of people using the said light. 
 
In practice, students should avoid placing their monitors directly in front of windows or white walls to prevent eye strain. 
It is vital to keep the monitors at arm’s length to avoid putting stress on the eyes from too much blue light emitted by digital 
monitors. Blue light glasses can also help protect the eyes from very harmful blue light emitted by screens. These kinds 
of glasses are available in the market today. One should also learn which color of light they find best and find the most 
comfortable.

Abstract 
The polymer ceramic composite has various dental applications due to its superior mechanical properties. The 
processing of polymer ceramic material through fused filament fabrication (FFF) is still a challenge due to specific 
requirements related to feedstock. Therefore, the current study attempts to develop a feedstock filament of 
Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Zirconia (ZrO2) for FFF. The solvent casting and screw extrusion methods have been 
used for polymer composite and filament preparation respectively. The quality of the developed filament has been 
examined using Scanning Electron Microscope. The results show good homogeneity and particle dispersion and 
the diameter of the developed filament is in the range of 1.65 mm to 1.75mm. 
Keywords 
Additive manufacturing, fused filament fabrication, tooth crown, and dental applications. 
1. Introduction
The tooth is one of the most important parts of the human body. For feeding, it is very necessary to have a healthy 
tooth but with time teeth get damaged. It can happen due to many reasons like tooth decay, accident, injuries, or 
just use over time, because of this tooth can lose their original shape. It is one of the most common teeth tissue 
diseases in oral clinical practice (Dai et al. 2016). To overcome this problem, tooth-shaped crowns are placed over 
the teeth (Francis et al. 1995). Dental crowns are made from many materials, but the selection of material is based 
on many factors such as good strength, cost-beneficial analysis, and good biocompatibility (Rathi and Verma 
2018). Materials for crown restoration fall into three basic types metal (Wassell, Walls, and Steele 2002), ceramic, 
and metal-ceramic (Iridio-platinum and Palladium 1956). Presently, CAD/CAM method is used for the fabrication 
of a dental crown and other dental applications. But CAD/CAM method (Mantri and Bhasin 2010) used for crown 
fabrication is capital extensive. To reduce capital extensive, an Additive Manufacturing method like Fused 
filament fabrication (Mohd Pu’ad et al. 2019) is used because it has the capabilities to fabricate complex three-
dimensional structures. For fabrication of dental crown using FFF, it is necessary to have filament under a certain 
range of diameter. A composite of Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Zirconia (ZrO2) ceramic powder is used for the 
development of customizable filament. PLA and ZrO2. Zirconia is an amphoteric oxide with a crystalline structure 
that can be monoclinic, tetragonal, or cubic and can react as either acid or a base substance. It is widely employed 
because of its superior physicochemical characteristics, which include high chemical stability, high mechanical 
strength, high melting point, high resistance to fracture, high corrosion resistance, low thermal conductivity, ionic 
conduction, and bio inertness (Albanés-Ojeda et al. 2020). Polylactic acid (PLA) is a thermoplastic polymer 
developed by molecules of lactic acid, which are linked by ester bonds and it has good biocompatibility and 
biodegradability (Tümer 2021).

Synthesis of polymer ceramic composite.

Literature Review
Albanés-Ojeda et al. (2020) fabricated polymer ceramic composite using PLA and zirconia. In this experiment 
different ratios of PLA and zirconia have been used for the preparation of composite and the tests were also done 
on composite. Polymer and ceramic mixed well for 24 hours for getting a homogeneous mixture. After testing it 
has been found that the mechanical properties of polymer increased by mixing ceramic into it. The most significant 
finding was that composites are mesoporous materials and that mesoporousness is caused by ZrO2 nanoparticles, 
which suggests that PLA/ZrO2 composite may be employed as a biomaterial.

Figure 5. (a) SEM of the surface of composite material, (b) The size of ceramic material in the composite. 
From the SEM analysis, it is concluded that the polymer and ceramic are mixed homogenously, and a proper 
particle dispersion takes place. The average size of ceramic inside PLA-ZrO2 composite is 400 nm as shown in 
Figure 5(b). 
6. Conclusion and Future scope
Using the solvent casting method, it is possible to synthesize PLA-ZrO2 Composite with homogeneity and good 
particle dispersion. In this study, it is examined that ceramic powder should have a sub-micron size for 
homogeneity of the polymer composite. For the development of filament temperature and screw rotation are 
important factors. After examining different temperatures, it is found that extrusion of filament takes place at 135 
degrees Celsius and the diameter ranges from 1.65 mm to 1.75 mm. By changing PLA-ZrO2 percentage ratio in 
the composite, there may be a difference in homogeneity and mechanical strength. But there are many ceramics 
and polymers available which be used for the synthesis of composite according to their applications. Apart from 
composite, a DC motor regulator can be used for controlling screw rotation which can improve filament extrusion 
and another cooling system can be used for filament cooling.

Abstract 
 
This study evaluated college students' mental fatigue between traditional face-to-face classes and online learning. Due 
to the coronavirus that started in the Philippines last March 2020, the students faced a fast transition to online learning. 
The teachers and students had a significant adjustment to that setup which affected the student's mental health, 
particularly mental fatigue. The researchers would like to assess and compare the mental fatigue of students between 
traditional and online learning; the researchers conducted a digital survey on the students with 100 respondents where 
51% are females, and 49% are males. The Mental fatigue questionnaire was used, and it was reported that 86% of 
students experience mental fatigue online and 74% in traditional. The ANOVA results for the comparison of both 
modalities showed that in an online setup, students are more prone to mental fatigue, with a mean of 18.825 and 16.010 
for a traditional setup. This study found that the only significant factor is the duration of study in an online class, and 
no factor was found to be significant in a traditional setup.

1. Introduction  
According to studies, mental fatigue is a feeling people can have after or during periods of intense cognitive effort. 
These emotions are relatively prevalent in modern life. They usually include tiredness or even exhaustion, aversion to 
continuing the current activity, and a reduction in dedication to the task (Holding, 1983; Hockey, 1997; Meijman, 
2000). Nowadays, students have their own experiences and judgments on the differences between both learning 
approaches. Some experiences cause mental fatigue and other health-related problems that affect the students' 
performances in school via Traditional or Online Learning. In a study by Mustika, et al. (2021), 274 medical students 
from the undergraduate level completed the survey in Malaysia. Students had moderate to strong favorable feelings 
regarding online learning, as well as high positive emotions and moderate negative emotions. 
 
The researchers want to deal with the different perspectives of mental fatigue through Students between traditional 
and online learning modalities. The problem is incorporated through the psychological and mental ideologies wherein 
the effects could be varied. A study by de Oliveira Kubrusly Sobral et al. (2022) showed that 56% of students using 
the hybrid model experienced zoom fatigue, and 41% of students using the PBL method experienced zoom fatigue. 
The hybrid methodology differed from the PBL student by having a higher frequency of wanting and needing to be 
alone after a videoconference. On the contrary, a feasibility study was conducted by Podrigalo et al. (2016), which 
concluded that there was a gradual improvisation of mental fatigue, which was unsatisfactory by subjective feelings. 
Nevertheless, some students have experienced getting lower marks and not passing a single examination through some 
combination of pressure, time, and health, depending on their respective experiences through both modalities. 
The mental fatigue of students in the hybrid setup where both traditional and online are implemented showed higher 
mental fatigue than in the fully online setup (de Oliveira Kubrusly Sobral et al., 2022). This study suggests that

In Table 2, only the factor Duration of study significantly affects the Mental Fatigue Score of students with a Pearson 
correlation of 0.207 and a p-value of 0.039, and none of the other factors are significant in an online setup. In Table 
3, none of the factors are significant. The results of their p-value are greater than the alpha of 0.05. Comparing the 
correlation result, only the duration of study in online classes significantly affects mental fatigue. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, the researchers gathered data from 100 respondents of college students in different schools in the 
Philippines, and the mental fatigue scale was used to determine the level of mental fatigue of the respondents. Also, 
the researchers determine and compare the factors such as the number of assessments that can student finish within 
the day, the difficulty of exams in different subjects/courses, duration of the study of the student, and the GPA of the 
student last term/semester. The survey received 50.5 percent female responses and 49.9 percent male responses. 
Furthermore, 75% of the students are between the ages of 18 and 20, and 25% are between the ages of 21 and 25, 
indicating that most of the students are in their sophomore year of college and have had exposure to both modes of 
learning. In an online format, 86 percent of students expressed mental fatigue; in a traditional version, 74 percent of 
students reported mental fatigue. As a result, both modalities have a reasonable chance of affecting students' mental 
fatigue in statistical analysis. Still, online learning is considerably more significant because more individuals were 
involved, and based on the ANOVA results, the online format has a mean of 18.825 and 16.010 in the traditional 
format. In correlation, the only significant factor was the duration of study in the online class. Students' mental fatigue 
is proportional to their duration of online study. 
 
5. Recommendation 
Based on the researcher's result, we recommend that future researchers explore the different factors that affect students 
on mental fatigue. Also, the researcher advises adding more respondents for the data to be more accurate in comparing 
the result of which learning modalities affect the most students in mental fatigue. Moreover, the researchers can study 
the different students, not only the college students but also the high school and elementary students.  
 
For students, the researchers recommend taking a rest and doing the assessment early or in advance before the deadline 
to lessen mental fatigue. It is suggested that time spent on leisure, other activities, and academic responsibilities, be 
well managed. Using an application, for example, that displays the schedule, and due date could make work easier to 
manage and prioritize. 
 
For institutions, it is advised that the school adjusts the distribution of major and minor courses loaded on each student 
per term. According to the findings, the stress in schoolwork, light sources in the house, and noise in the study area 
increase a student's mental fatigue level. This indicates that students' mental fatigue is linked to their physical health. 
Furthermore, the findings revealed that a student's typical study hours considerably impact their level of mental 
fatigue. In theory, a student's average study hours are related to the units in their program. As a result, if the student's 
task is distributed differently, the study hours will also alter.

Abstract 
This study evaluates undergraduate students' coffee consumption levels and investigates how it affects their 
psychological well-being during online learning. Caffeine is a psychostimulant that boosts body energy levels, and 
coffee is its primary medium in beverages, so it is popular among students due to their need for help studying, 
especially during online classes. However, caffeine also has adverse effects. The researchers gathered data from a 
sample of 100 college students through a digital survey that aimed to know their level of coffee consumption and 
general mental health status using the GHQ-12 questionnaire. The GHQ-12 generates social dysfunction, anxiety and 
depression, and loss of confidence. The data obtained from the respondents were analyzed using descriptive and 
inferential statistics, and measurements of this study have determined that age and social dysfunction are associated 
with coffee consumption. It was concluded that age is directly proportional to coffee consumption, and students with 
high social dysfunction tend to consume a high amount of coffee. The researchers recommend that educational 
institutions must hold seminars for their students to discuss this awareness and encourage dosage limits of coffee to 
students.

1. Introduction
Coffee is one of the most commonly consumed beverages in the world and a major source of caffeine. Caffeine is a 
widely known psychostimulant that mainly boosts energy levels of the human body, increasing alertness (The 
Nutrition Source, 2020). The increase in caffeine use is evident worldwide due to its positive effects on the 
cardiovascular system and central nervous system of the body. The caffeine compound has inotropic and chronotropic 
effects. It stimulates locomotor activity, which activates an improvement in physical performance and cognitive 
functions such as concentration and memory enhancement (Cappelletti et al., 2015). Coffee beans, tea leaves, cocoa 
beans, and kola nuts naturally consist of caffeine in their system. Additionally, caffeine can also be extracted and 
added to other types of foods and beverages. With these, dietary products such as coffee, tea, yerba mate, cola-type 
sodas, and energy drinks are primary sources of the stimulant compound commonly ingested by consumers (Zucconi 
et al., 2013).  
According to the study by Verster & Koenig (2018), adults from the age of 18 to 35 years old have a 98.6% caffeine 
intake, and around 55.8% of it comes from coffee. Thus, the regular source of caffeine among adults is the 
consumption of coffee. Students and workers fall under this age category, so it is natural for them to have a higher 
intake of coffee than the other age groups. With its benefits of heightening brain activity and sustaining the flow of 
nutrients, it helps them achieve an improved mood and boosts their focus. Hence, drinking coffee is considered a 
benefactor to worker efficiency (Frisch, 2015).

coffee consumption. The data shows that consumption with a p-value of 0.015 is significant with age. It only indicates 
that coffee consumption increases if a person is aging; the more a person ages, the higher the coffee intake they 
consume on a daily basis.  
 
Social dysfunction is a social problem that causes hardship in interaction with different people who surround a certain 
person with this social problem. Social dysfunction is correlated with coffee consumption with a p-value of 0.001, 
which shows that they are significant to one another, meaning that students with social dysfunction tend to consume 
a higher amount of coffee. It causes anxiety and depression, losing confidence. Students having anxiety and depression 
correlate with losing their confidence because the data shows it has a p-value of 0. Stress, anxiety, and depression are 
related to caffeine consumption (Richards, G., & Smith, A. 2015). As a result, it can be proven that excessive 
consumption of coffee has a negative effect or increases the probability of mental health problems, specifically social 
dysfunction. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, the researchers collected data through a questionnaire given to 100 undergraduate college students who 
consume and drink coffee. The researcher used a 4-point Likert scale to rate the respondents' mental health and 
measured the results by Goldberg's 12-item General Health Questionnaire, which helps assess an individual's 
physiological status and determine the presence of social dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and loss of confidence. 
The result of the demographic shows that most of the respondents gathered were males aged from 21-to 22 years old, 
currently in their second year of college. Most respondents consumed 1 to 2 cups of coffee daily and preferred to drink 
coffee any time of the day. And lastly, most of the respondents consume coffee for school purposes based on the 
survey given. 
 
In the Mental Health Measurement or the GHQ-12 Questionnaire, the respondents were given 12 items to evaluate 
the presence of a mental disorder. These 12 items are namely: worrying, ability to concentrate, losing much sleep over 
worry, playing a useful part, capable to make decisions, under stress, not being able to overcome difficulties, able to 
enjoy day-to-day activities, being able to face problems, feel unhappy and depressed, losing confidence, thinking of 
self as worthless, and feeling reasonably happy. The results show that 51.10% of the respondents showed signs of 
social dysfunction, 35.09% showed signs of anxiety and depression, and 13.81% showed signs of loss of confidence. 
 
Based on the correlation analysis results, coffee consumption and the respondents' age showed a significant 
relationship, thus proving that consumption of coffee also increases with age. Furthermore, another factor that led to 
a significant relationship is the consumption of coffee and the presence of social dysfunction in the respondents, thus 
stating that an increase in consumption of coffee can also increase social dysfunction in the consumer. Other 
comparisons of factors such as consumption of coffee with anxiety and depression and coffee with loss of confidence 
have no significant differences. Therefore, it can be proven that a high amount of coffee indicates an adverse effect or 
risk of mental health disorders, specifically social dysfunction. Social dysfunction is one of the symptoms of 
neuropsychiatric disorders and has been repeatedly associated with severe health outcomes such as possible suicidal 
risk and poor communication with people (Porcelli, 2020). 
 
6. Recommendation 
The results of the statistical analysis and the study's outcome proved that a high amount of coffee consumed by 
undergraduate students appears to have a negative effect on their mental health status. Thus, the researchers have 
concluded to provide recommendations and probable solutions to this problem. For educational institutions, the 
researchers suggest that they uphold their policies to support and care for students' welfare by initiating mental health 
awareness programs within their respective communities. Such programs must include online webinars or discussion 
programs about how overconsumption of coffee can expose students to risks of mental health disorders, specifically 
Social dysfunction, which has been proven in this study. This initiative will help students be encouraged to improve 
their mental health during online learning so they can perform better without being negatively affected by the coffee 
they consume.  
 
For the students, self-awareness is encouraged by the researchers. Knowing their amount of coffee intake and its 
noticeable effects on the system of their bodies would help them evaluate their well-being. However, the researchers 
mainly suggest that those students who drink such a high amount of coffee, more than 2 cups per day, must reduce 
their consumption due to the determined risks according to the study. The researchers also suggest alternative brain-

boosting beverages to expand the students' options and aid them during their online classes, such as green tea, 
kombucha, etc.  
 
For future researchers, since the study determined only a single correlation that directly associates coffee consumption 
with the mental health status of college students, it indicates that coffee consumption alone cannot predict the students' 
overall psychological well-being but only a part of it. In addition, coffee consumption is this study's only primary 
dependent variable. Thus, the researchers recommend considering more factors that could affect the psychological 
well-being of undergraduate students during online learning, such as the quantity of sleep, frequency of eating meals 
per day, duration of breaks, and academic workload.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 crisis has drastically altered people's lives and livelihoods. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, 
online learning has been the standard for higher education institutions. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic and 
the resulting institution closures caused significant physical isolation among university students worldwide. This study 
aims to evaluate the perceived influence of COVID-19 productivity on undergraduate students of Mapúa University. 
The researchers used descriptive statistics to analyze data from a sample of 100 participants who completed an online 
survey that contained demographic profiles and academic information. Moreover, the researchers also utilized a paired 
sample t-test to measure the students' satisfaction with overall experiences in online and traditional face-to-face classes 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four (4) factors were identified: workload, financial status, convenience, 
and technology use. As a result, researchers distinguished the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the productivity 
of undergraduate students at Mapúa University.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus, has drastically changed the lives of millions of people 
worldwide, including students, in just a few months (Aristovnik, 2020). This pandemic has far-reaching ramifications 
for higher education students living and working, significantly impacting their physical and mental health. As a result 
of the need to protect their students against viral transmissions, schools and universities have come to a complete halt 
in their regular work. Due to the rapidly spreading contamination, only a few schools in China and a few other 
significantly affected nations were forced to close as of the first week of February of 2020. As of mid-March, almost 
75 countries have enacted or declared the shutdown of academic institutions (Muthuprasad et al., 2021). 
In contrast, students adapt to the 'new normal,' particularly online education, the sense of a comparatively more 
significant burden prohibited students from perceiving a higher performance. Students were primarily bored, 
uncomfortable, and dissatisfied and expressed concerns about their future professional careers and study challenges. 
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, more than nations employed lock-down procedures at least once nationally or 
locally. As a result of these closures, face-to-face classes have been converted to online learning (Kwok et al., 2020). 
This infectious disease has a considerable effect on the lives of students. Issues can involve increased workload, 
rapidly transitioning to an e-learning environment, and increased anxiety due to uncertainties and pandemic anxiety. 
Furthermore, in the study of Paul & Jefferson (2019), there has been an increase in students taking online classes. For 
them, the traditional classroom setting is constricting, rigid, and ineffective. As technology continues to progress, 
schools are capable of providing classroom instruction through the internet. In light of this transition in educational 
tools, schools and universities are compelled to reevaluate how they intend to offer their course material. 
The coronavirus causes cough, cold, sneezing, fever, and other respiratory symptoms (WHO, 2019). This disease

expected under Mapúa's academic curriculum. Moreover, some of the students had experienced traditional classes 
and were entirely online; however, most of the students preferred online classes (52%). Although there are different 
units taken by each student, 46 of them are satisfied with their unit load, and 40% of the students can manage their 
time very well. On the other hand, the unit load taken by the students corresponds to the price of their enrollment. 
The more units are taken, the more subjects to pay for. Therefore, the respondents are mostly neutral to the financial 
category. 
 
Furthermore, the students who took traditional classes vary differently. Regarding workload, the respondents are 
satisfied with the number of units taken because they can manage their time, and their study duration aligns and fits 
well with their routine. Moreover, in the financial category, the respondents are satisfied with their income and the 
matriculation payment for each semester. The majority of the students can handle finance. However, there is a neutral 
response regarding convenience for the students. The result is almost the same from dissatisfied to satisfied. Some 
students find the traditional face slightly inconvenient, while some are pleased with the classes. Lastly, most 
students are satisfied with the devices because gadgets such as mobile phones and laptops are allowed inside the 
campus, which is very convenient for studying. In terms of communication, many satisfied students can easily 
communicate with the other students for some schoolwork. However, some are neutral about the source of the 
internet on campus. 
 
Given that the result is assessed and appropriately organized according to the respondents' answers, most students 
are satisfied with the fully online and traditional setup. However, some are neutral in the financial category of this 
pandemic. Several students are neutral regarding internet speed and source of the internet because some have 
connectivity issues due to many people using the internet for work and school. Hence, the effects of the COVID-
19 pandemic on the productivity of the students slightly have a negative impact in terms of online classes because 
there are hindrances such as internet speed, source of internet, and financial status. On the other hand, regarding the 
students' workload, the majority of the respondents are satisfied. Thus, the effect of COVID-19 on productivity did 
not slightly affect. The students adapted well to the pandemic environment; that is why some are satisfied with the 
current phase of their college. 
 
6. Recommendation 
This research has uncovered several new possibilities for future research. While the current study focused mainly 
on identifying the effects of COVID-19 on undergraduate students of Mapúa University, further analysis can 
include other students from different universities within the country for more extensive research. With that, current 
researchers recommend increasing the number of respondents to acquire more information from students enrolled 
in various universities in the Philippines. Moreover, future researchers can consider the mental well-being of the 
students during the COVID-19 pandemic, as this is deemed to be one of the possible factors most affected by the 
current circumstances. The relevance of these issues regarding mental health is associated with how students 
perform in schools and universities; thus, it needs more awareness to ensure that this matter is tackled.

Abstract 
Today, the business world is in extreme competition. Every organization is striving hard to find an ideal strategy to 
stand out from the rest of its competitors. However, achieving Excellence is far from easy, and faced with problems. 
Organizations usually use improvement approaches with experts in Total Quality Management (TQM), Lean 
Management (LM), and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) to overcome punctual problems. Unfortunately, companies still need 
a holistic and innovative framework involving the organization staff for solving problems. Therefore, this paper 
proposes a futuristic framework for organizations’ improvement integrating TRIZ and LSS from the strategy to 
operational execution. The proposed model was based on a literature review on excellence, LSS, and TRIZ. 
Furthermore, the Authors’ experience as academics, researchers, and industrialists facilitate the framework 
experimentation in a real context. The results show that the framework allows companies to develop a continuous 
improvement culture, focus on priorities and develop an innovative approach to solving problems. This system will 
enable future research and management systems to take the framework as a basis for continuous improvement and to 
open the opportunity to discover TRIZ differently.

1. Introduction
Excellence represents one of the most valuable objectives that companies seek. It is essential to be innovative, 
continuous improvement, and satisfy customers' requirements (Antony, 2017). Unfortunately, few companies improve 
themselves continuously, solve problems efficiently and prosper year after year (Edgeman, 2018). Moreover, many 
companies considered leaders in their field end up failing (Carvalho & al, 2019). Companies are still looking for the 
ideal framework to achieve excellence. Over the past few decades, many management systems and approaches such 
as TQM, LM, Kaizen, Six Sigma (SS), LSS, and TRIZ have emerged for improving Business (Prashar, 2018;). LSS 
Was defined as the global and popular methodology to improve customer satisfaction, reduce cost and increase process 
speed. LSS provides value focus and allows process robustness (Antony, 2017; Sunder, 2018; Parashar, 2018). LSS

At this stage, solutions are identified and achieved. Visual management, Poka-Yoke, and standards must be 
implemented or revised to sustain the proposed solution. The solution is communicated and tested. The result is 
evaluated according to the objective. However, sometimes we need to make adjustments. When the goal is achieved, 
the Problem solver or project leader communicates, informs, or trains the concerned stakeholders. The detection system 
allows a continuous and sustained improvement over time 
5.2 Discussion 
Through the literature review, we extract five essential basics of excellence. We review frameworks integrating LSS 
and TRIZ according to those five basics. We conclude that most of the studied frameworks use TRIZ in the innovation 
step. Furthermore, frameworks do not present a continuous improvement philosophy. Projects are chosen using 
brainstorming rather than strategy or KPI. We suggest starting the “excellence heart framework” from the 
organization’s strategy. Objectives and strategic projects are declined to the operational level to be executed. We 
recommend implicating the company’s stakeholders in the improvement through HOSHIN KANRI. Furthermore, 
everyone is responsible for detecting and initiating the seven-point report when there is a gap between objectives and 
the actual results. To improve the detection step efficiency, we use the TRIZ matrix. We suggest some examples such 
as visual management and digital solutions to increase agility and preserve data accuracy. Besides, in the literature, 
TRIZ is less used than LSS. Users feel some complexity in learning TRIZ tools. We integrate TRIZ with LSS to 
simplify TRIZ use in the industry and to eliminate some LSS tools’ limitations.  
During ten years of experience, authors worked in many multinational companies. They gradually build this 
framework. First, we implement operational objectives for each production line. At this moment, the idea was to set 
an improvement culture at all companies’ levels. We train a team to be project leaders and LSS experts. In addition, 
we set the DDIC approach as a standard to conduct improvement projects using only LSS. We could improve the 
global efficiency from 50% to 80%, and reduce the lead time from 15 days to 5 days. The result was incredible 
especially because of the process stakeholder’s implication. The result was maintained during the daily operational 
review. The project’s success has a significant impact on the improvement culture. Service managers start new projects 
improvements. Unfortunately, at this moment, we had time resource conflicts. Many projects are opening and many 
projects do not respond to the global strategy. The Hoshin kanri was the ideal solution to focus our energy on the 
global strategy. Finally, to improve team creativity, we integrate TRIZ in the DDIC approach to overcome 
psychological inertia. We increased productivity from 86% to 116%. Furthermore, we could respond to the new 
customer take time without machine investment. 
The Excellence heart framework presents basics that are important to get excellence. The framework moves over the 
problem limits and gives a systematic and innovative approach to solvers. The global culture has a significant impact 
on making possible the framework implementation.  
6. Conclusion
In conclusion, the excellence heart framework could be used to solve any business problem. The strategic and 
operational levels enable communication between stakeholders and focus the staff energy on objectives. TRIZ and 
LSS integration makes problem-solving easier. Therefore, the framework engages everyone in continuous, innovative, 
and sustained improvement. The proposed Tools make possible the TRIZ integration into industries. The framework 
integration in the company’s production system or ISO will positively affect companies’ performance. 
Further research must take into consideration human complexity. The company’s culture, management, staff 
motivation, and human personalities need to be studied and integrated into the framework. The framework was tested 
in complex and complicated problems, but we need to test if the framework will positively influence chaotic issues in 
the COVID19 context or in the ware context.

Abstract 
 Moment resisting frames, shear wall systems, bracing systems, space trusses, tubular structures, and other 
structural systems are used to design tall buildings. Diagrid is a modern structural technology that is being used 
to develop tall buildings. A parametric comparison of simple frame construction, diagrid, and hexagrid structural 
systems is conducted in this project. For simple frame buildings, diagrid and hexagrid structural systems, the 13, 
37, and 46-storey structure with shear wall was modelled and analyzed. A shear wall with a thickness of 230 mm 
is used. A total of 18 structures are modelled and analyzed. The modelling and analysis are done using ETABS. 
The response spectrum method is used for earthquake dynamic analysis, and the wind dynamic analysis is used 
for wind dynamic analysis. Maximum storey displacement, maximum storey drift, base shear, and fundamental 
time period parameters for all models are compared in the analysis. The diagrid construction is found to be better 
than the bare structure, in terms of stiffness, rigidity and responses. 
Keywords 
Diagrid, Hexagrid, shear wall, storey displacement, base shear, fundamental time-period and story drift and 
structural systems. 
1. Introduction
 A high-rise building's structural system is designed to withstand vertical gravity loads as well as lateral loads 
caused by wind or seismic activity. All other members are referred to as non-structural members because they do 
not form part of the structural system. In structural engineering, the term ‘structural system’ or 'structural frame' 
refers to a structure's load resisting subsystem. Loads are transferred through the structural system by 
interconnected structural components or members. Due to rapid urbanization and population growth, the cost of 
land is rapidly increasing, and land availability has become a constraint for developers and builders. As a result, 
vertical growth appears to be a natural process. Controlling lateral responses while keeping constructability and 
cost in mind has become the order of the day for structural engineers. The increased wind pressure caused by the 
building's large, exposed area, the high intensity of the wind at higher elevations, and the earthquake loads all 
contribute to the bulk of structural forces. Recent developments in tall building design bring new challenges to 
structural designers, in addition to the classic needs for strength, stiffness, ductility, and system efficiency. The 
tube concept is used in structural configurations that best satisfy the typical demand of strength and stiffness for 
tall buildings. 
2. Literature Review
Moona (2011), The performance of diagrid systems used for complex-shaped tall buildings such as twisted, tilted, 
and freeform towers is investigated in this paper. Diagrid structures are widely used for tall buildings today 
because of their structural efficiency and architectural potential. This study made use of metric structural models. 
Kani et al (2013) studied plan of 36 story diagrid steel building. A normal floor plan of 36 m × 36 m size is thought 
of. ETABS programming is utilized for demonstrating and investigation of structure. All underlying individuals 
are planned utilizing IS 800:2007 thinking about all heap blends. Burden dispersion in diagrid framework is 
likewise read for 36 story building. Likewise, the investigation and configuration consequences of 50, 60, 70 and 
80 story diagrid structures are introduced. From the review it is seen that a large portion of the parallel burden is 
opposed by diagrid segments on the outskirts, while gravity load is opposed by both the inner segments and 
peripherial inclining segments. In this way, inner sections should be intended for vertical burden as it were. 
Because of expansion in switch arm of peripherial a skew sections, diagrid primary framework is more powerful 
in horizontal burden obstruction. Horizontal and gravity load are opposed by hub power in corner to corner 
individuals on outskirts of structure, which make framework more powerful. Diagrid primary framework gives 
greater adaptability in arranging inside space and exterior (Deepika et al. 2016) Tall buildings' load action differs

Abstract 
The study aims to explore the impact of capital structure on the energy sector in India. Several variables were identified 
in order to know their effects on the capital structure of energy sector in India. The analysis comprises panel data set 
of 28 companies ranging from 2009 to 2020 which leads to a total of 336 sample size. Hausman test is performed to 
find the best fit model among the several panel data regressions. The variables firm size, interest coverage and 
operating expenses are significant in relation to book leverage of the firm. The findings of the study reveal that 43% 
of the book leverage of the firm. The firm leverage, industrial leverage, firm leverage one lag have a significant impact 
on the capital structure and suggested that the energy sector has comparatively less risk and has good profit. The 
results obtained were statistically significant. 
Key words 
Book leverage, Capital Structure, Operating costs, Hausman Test and panel data. 
1. Introduction
India ‘s energy sector is one of the most varied in the world. These sources range from coal, lignite, oil, natural gas 
and various sources like solar, wind, agriculture and waste produced by agricultural activities. The demand for 
electricity has increased immensely and also is expected to increase in the years to come. Hence, the demand for 
energy sector is increased.  
Over the next 20 years, India is expected to have the highest rise in energy consumption among any nation in the 
world as its economy continues to grow and provide its population more affluence. The dilemma of how to effectively 
supply this rising demand without aggravating problems like expensive energy imports, air pollution, and greenhouse 
gas emissions is raised by the mix of a developing and industrialising economy and an expanding and increasingly 
urban population. The analysis shows that India's electrical industry is changing, making it possible for the supply of 
clean, cheap, and dependable power to an increasing number of families and companies. This transformation is being 
driven by the fast spread of solar power and smart policy-making. The industrial and transportation sectors, which 
include things like road freight, steel, and cement, will prove much harder to expand sustainably, as it is the case with 
economies all around the world. 
Energy security concerns in India are many and constantly changing. According to current policy parameters, India's 
total import cost for fossil fuels is expected to quadruple over the next two decades, with oil making up the vast 
majority of this total. Domestic production of oil and gas continues to lag behind demand trends, and by 2040, net 
reliance on imported oil will have increased from 75% to over 90%. This ongoing reliance on imported fuels exposes 
us to price cycles, volatility, and potential supply interruptions. If system flexibility is not greatly strengthened, many 
electrical distribution businesses' financial health is not addressed, and other reform plans are not carried out, India's 
domestic market may also see dangers to energy security, notably in the electricity sector.The main aim of this paper 
is to identify the impact of capital structure in the energy sector and the analysis of the same has been done by 
identifying various variables.

From Table 8 the significant values have been obtained after performing the regression analysis  which shows that 
firm leverage 1lag has a significance value less than 0.05 which means the null hypothesis is rejected. And shows that 
there is a significant relationship between the book leverage and Firm leverage 1 lag. The rest of the variables are 
above the significance level which projects that the null hypothesis is accepted and there is no significant relation 
between book leverage and these variables. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The study was mainly done to identify the various factors that affect the capital structure in the Indian energy sector. 
With 336 observations and panel data covering the years 2009 to 2020, the study looked into the factors that influence 
capital structure. The study's objective is to identify the numerous characteristics that have a significant impact on 
capital structure as well as to assess how capital structure affects company value in the paper sector. For identifying 
the best fit model, Hausman test models are used. The findings indicate that it is possible to establish the capital 
structure of the Indian energy sector by the independent variables that have been identified. 
 
The descriptive statistics enabled that the companies has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt and the 
earnings of the companies are quite volatile. The Hausman test was conducted to know the best fit model which is the 
fixed effect model. The analysis considers the factors book leverage and company size to be important. The regression 
analysis portrayed that the variable firm leverage has a significant relationship with the book leverage and the rest of 
the variables does not have a significant relationship. The regression analysis suggested that only the variable firm 
leverage 1 lag has a significant relationship with the dependent variable and the rest of the variables does not have a 
significance relation with the dependent variables and is not much effective. 
 
5.1 Limitations and Future Scope 
The study was only limited to energy sector and for a period of 12 years for 28 companies. The variables that were 
identified were also limited. Further analysis can be done on various other industries and by identifying different 
variables that have an impact on the capital structure of the companies by using similar or more advanced methods 
for analysing the variables.

Abstract 
The fabrication of porous scaffolds is a significant challenge in orthopedic applications. Bone fractures can be 
repaired using porous biomaterial scaffolds. In addition to promoting bone growth, they also aid in the tissues' 
ability to osseointegrate. Porous scaffolds are increasingly being made using Additive Manufacturing (AM) 
methods. Modeling and finite element analysis (FEA) allow for more affordable exploration of the mechanical 
and biological behavior of patient-specific implants. In this study, we have used the CAD programme Creo to 
construct a scaffold lattice structure with three different unit cells triangular, hexagonal, and octagonal, and finite 
element analysis (FEA) of the compressive strength of these unit cells has been carried out using the Abaqus 
software. Compressive strength of lattice structures based on these three-unit cells was studied for the 
biocompatible PLA thermoplastic polymer with a strut size of 2mm. 
Keywords 
Anatomically shaped scaffold, additive manufacturing, lattice structures, FEA, and SA/V ratio. 
4. Introduction
Bone implants are necessary for new bone to grow on the surface of the bone, which then helps to repair the 
damaged bone that is too large to mend on its own. Metal biomaterials are utilized in orthopedics, and implants 
are made from biocompatible materials Wang et al. (20!6). The most common cause of implant failure is aseptic 
loosening which is caused by the stress shielding effect Hedayati et al. (2016).  Porous characteristics in implants 
are primarily designed to reduce the implant's stiffness, as stated by Singh et al. (2017). It is feasible to get rid of 
stress shielding effects by altering the elastic modulus of the implant. It has been reported that the elastic modulus 
of cortical and trabecular bones is in range from 3 to 30 GPa, while that of trabecular bones is in range from 0.02-
2 GPa Chen and Thouas (2015). Low dense porous scaffolds that provide cell adhesion, mechanical stability, and 
fluid perfusion are developed to counteract the stress shielding, (Bandyopadhy.et al. 2010). Maintaining a porous 
geometry in bone implants is considered beneficial for nutrient transport, osseointegration, and enhanced bone 
ingrowth. Patient-specific implants can be made by altering the strut size of open porous scaffolds to control 
porosity. Manufacturing open cell porous scaffolds is attainable with the use of AM methods. 
Aerospace, automotive, and medical industries are just a few of the many that have embraced AM as a result of 
its many advantages, such as shortened product development cycles, the capacity to make components with 
complicated geometry, decreased fabrication costs, and shorter lead time Sulaiman et al. (2021) and Zhang et al. 
(2019). The AM method is frequently used to manufacture cellular-patterned components. This is due to the fact 
that the AM technique offers a distinct advantage over more conventional manufacturing procedures by allowing 
the fabrication of complex geometries in the form of finished products Alfaify et al. (2020). One of the most 
popular additive manufacturing procedures is the Fuse Deposition Modelling (FDM) method due of its low price, 
high efficiency, and low learning curve. In most cases, FDM is used with thermoplastic polymers like polylactic 
acid, acrylic butadiene styrene (ABS), and recycled plastic Ford and Despeisse (2016).  
The modern term for the design of cellular patterns is ""lattice structure."" Using lattice structures in additive 
manufacturing helps to increase the amount of energy that can be absorbed by the component while decreasing 
the amount of time required for the printing process. There are two types of lattice structures; those with a random 
structure are called stochastic, while those with a regular pattern are called non-stochastic Niu et al. (2018). 
Modern CAD modelling software is frequently used for the design of a lattice-structured component. The FEA 
simulation allows researchers to analyze the lattice's mechanical behavior before the structure is actually produced 
into a genuine part. The influence of the lattice structure and lattice parameter on the mechanical properties of the 
specimen was studied by Choo et al. (2017)] using finite element analysis simulation. By employing FEA 
simulation, the researchers were able to determine the lattice structure with the optimal stiffness-to-weight ratio.

The SA/V ratio is the primary factor to consider while choosing the most effective scaffold design from the three 
lattices structures. For the same amount of scaffold volume, the SA/V ratio of the triangular (60.08 percent porous) 
comes out to be 1.98, 1.94 for the hexagonal (52.06 percent porous), and 1.51 for the octagonal (41.57 percent 
porous). The SA/V ratio should be increased because this would result in greater vascularization and cell 
proliferation. As a result, the triangular design with strut thickness of 2 millimeters is the most appropriate for 
achieving the requisite porosity and compressive strength. 
 
7. Conclusion 
In this study, modelling of porous structures made of biocompatible PLA material (triangular, hexagonal, and 
octagonal) and their FEA have been undertaken to simulate the compressive behavior of the material under uni-
axial load. Compressive stresses, porosity, surface area, and volume of all scaffolds were analyzed and compared. 
Elastic moduli were determined by the FEA to be 240 MPa for the hexagonal lattice structure scaffold, 235 MPa 
for the octagonal scaffold, and 687 MPa for the triangular scaffold. The SA/V ratio of the triangular lattice 
structure is higher than that of the other lattice structures, hence it is recommended as the optimal choice. 
Fabrication of all scaffolds will be done in the future as part of the planned activity in order to validate the results

of the FEA. In-vitro and in-vivo testing for biomechanical qualities can also be carried out to confirm that 
triangular structures promote faster rates of bone formation.

Abstract 
In the present work, we have investigated the sample orientation effects on the wear behaviour of laser powder 
bed fusion (LPBF) processed 17%Cr-4%Ni precipitation hardenable (P.H) steel. The samples were printed in 
three directions (horizontal (0o), vertical (90o) and inclined (45o) in the build platform using DMLS system.  
(EOS M 290) machine. 17%Cr-4%NiP.H steel samples were given rough polish, medium polish and fine polish. 
The microstructure was studied for both as printed and surface modified conditions using scanning electron 
(SEM) microscopes. The wear test was tested for all three orientations. The input parameters selected were: 
applied load of 10N, sliding distance of 1000m, rubbing time of 30min with ambient working temperature. The 
wear rate was measured and compared among orientations for as printed and surface modified conditions to 
identify the best orientation. The post worn surface was analysed using SEM to identify wear mechanisms. The 
key findings from the present work are; 
1. LB-PBF 17-4 PH SS as-built specimens have high wear rate as compared to polished conditions. This is most
likely related to the hardness of LB-PBF 17-4 PH SS.
2. Medium finish- Horizontal built LB-PBF 17-4 PH SS possesses higher wear rate as compared to rough and
fine finished samples. This is attributed to the lath  martensite and austenite formed on the surface a result

Introduction: 
Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technology that generates 3D structures 
layer by layer by selectively melting powdered material with a laser. It is possible to create components with 
sophisticated geometry that would be impossible to create using traditional methods without spending a 
significant amount of time, money, and resources. There is no need for costly tooling, which allows for the rapid 
manufacture of one-of-a-kind designs. 
Adopters must introduce new product strategies for product qualification, quality assurance, production, and 
post-processing requirement to implement LPBF in industry.Adeyemiet.al. (2018) discovered parameters to be 
critical in the changing characteristics of the powder bed-based laser additive manufacturing process. This paper 
provides an overview of the selective laser sintering and selective laser melting processes used in the powder

Abstract 
In recent decades the high demands of Dual-Phase (DP) brass find wide applications in electrical, electronic and 
other appliance industries. Therefore, study of material characterisation and springback behaviour are essential in 
forming of sheet metal components. In the present work, an isothermal uniaxial tensile test was performed to 
evaluate the accurate mechanical properties, which are essential pre-requisite for optimization of process parameters 
to decrease and minimize spring-back for any sheet-metal-forming operations. The V-bending test was conducted at 
specified test parameters temperature (773 K, 873 K, and 973 K), punch velocity (1 mm/min, 5 mm/min, and 10 
mm/min), holding-time (30 s, 60 s, and 90 s) and orientation (00, 450, and 900) concerning rolling direction. Taguchi 
approach was utilized to optimize the test parameters such as temperature, punch velocity, holding-time, and 
orientation. The optimal set of parameters obtained were Temperature (973 K), Punch Velocity (1 mm/min), 
Holding-Time (90 sec) & orientation (90°) and using these optimal set of parameters a confirmation test has been 
conducted and it was reported that the spring-back was decreased significantly in V-bending process for dual phase 
(DP) brass sheet. The main objective of the study is to investigate the springback behaviour in V-bending process on 
brass sheets to understand the formability and to optimise the processes parameter to minimize the springback effect 
using Taguchi Technique to meet the needs of the sheet metal forming processes.

highly significant factor followed by holding-time, orientation, and punch velocity. Optimal setting of test 
factors were temperature = 973 K, punch velocity = 1 mm/min, holding-time = 90 sec, & orientation = 90°. 
With these optimal set parameters, the spring-back effect was decreased to around 72.68%.  
•
It was reported that Springback is inversely proportional to test temperature and holding-time but directly
proportional to the punch velocity. The relationship associated with orientation and spring-back angle was
not distinct but is observed that spring-back is highest at 45° and then followed by 0° & 90°.

Abstract 
Object detection or the prediction of the objects in the image form can be performed in tremendous ways as a 
general means. Here we are detecting the objects by the collaboration of the deep-learning along with the IOT 
technology, so that the predicting system or PC will be in one place and the capturing smart phones will be in some-
other place, using IOT the auto capturing, and the detection of object along will label of name is achieved with one 
of the pre-trained neural networks in deep learning called Google net. So as to reduce the training time and the 
accurate prediction of the object can be obtained. The object detection is probability checked out or compared out 
between the prediction accuracy inside state and the other state. And the time taken for the prediction of the objects 
is also made into concern. In this paper the simple smart phones which can be available with everyone’s hand the 
object detection is handled out in the real-time and predicted with the personal computer with the booming 
technologies. 
Keywords 
IOT, real-time, deep-learning, object detection and object prediction. 
1. Introduction
Now a day, the most challenging and trending task is the object detection in collaboration of the hardware devices 
with the computer vision for the accurate prediction of the objects. As the object detection is in fact used in 
tremendous applications such as in retail, in the crop lands to predict the animals arrival, even in the houses for the 
security purposes etc, and the featuring advancement like the face detection , emotions prediction , vehicle number 
plate prediction, numbering of the persons in the crowd of people gathering, as the advancement of this the object 
detection is even in the autonomous vehicle technology for the safety drive of the driver , passengers as well as the 
pedestrians.  As far as above said the importance of the object prediction pays a major role. 
In the Existing System the object detection importance is given in the video surveillances using bounding box and 
horizontal boxes, by using of the IP camera for the real time prediction with more accuracy, by the inclusion of the 
hardware device Raspberry pi uses the pi camera in order to predict the real time objects in the fixed places etc., so 
the prediction of the objects whether in the normal means or the real time means the predictions are all carried out 
by the static PC or the hardware devices in the fixed means.in other wards we could say that the detection of objects 
and the prediction will be covered under the same less coverage area and the clarity and the accuracy of prediction 
process is somewhat less also. 
 Here considering this we experimented to predict the objects between inside and outside State. The objects are 
detected by means of using the Internet of things technology and using deep-learning technology with more accurate 
label and less time interval irrespective of the smart phone camera resolution and the distance.

The Figure 14. Shows the graphical representation of the object Banana with complete full accuracy value though 
there exist a numerous number of extensions to indicate the similar things the prediction is fabulous. 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
There is no need for the fixed hardware component to detect objects. The range of prediction is high and the 
memory storage of the objects is less as the object can be detected in the required time interval. 
5.4 Validation  
The validation of the detected objects from the two different zones is done by means of the effective and simple 
online Mat lab tool so that the score card and the and the object prediction in the real time is got out here. 
6. Conclusion
Thus the prediction of the objects from one static area with the smart phone devices of different states are connected 
via cloud are predicted with a high accuracy in the high internet strength regions and the less accuracy is only 
because of the low internet strength only, rather than this the prediction time required all over the two zone is in 
minimum time of 10sec and maximum time of 12sec. so the experimentation of the prediction of the objects 
between the two states by sitting one place is successfully achieved. This general idea and the methodology of the 
object prediction could be applied for the applications of the object detection for specific tasks and the only 
drawback is the internet strength required is quiet good so that the probability of prediction and the accuracy results 
in high.

Abstract 
Lean Six Sigma has emerged as a business improvement strategy worldwide, emerged from the merger of Lean 
philosophy and Six Sigma methodology. The literature revealed many success stories of Lean Six Sigma 
deployment in diverse sectors but also indicated numerous failures at different stages of deployments. Therefore, 
this paper mainly focuses on exploring the failure factors of Lean Six Sigma deployment and examines the most 
influencing failure factors of Lean Six Sigma deployment. The study's outcome underlines the eight impactful 
failure factors of Lean Six Sigma deployment using the Pareto analysis of twenty-eight failure factors. The 
literature. The study revealed the impactful failure factors as lack of top management commitment and involvement, 
lack of synergy of LSS and business strategy, lack of awareness on LSS, resistance related to culture change, lack of 
availability of resources, and lack of training and education, lack of visionary leadership, and lack of financial 
resources. Understanding these failure factors of Lena Six Sigma deployment may help the professionals avoid 
failures.

1. Introduction
The world has changed a lot due to technological disruptions, innovations, and interventions in activities in the 
manufacturing and service sectors in the last thirty years. The pace of change has even excelled drastically in the 
recent past, which led to numerous challenges and global competition to the business organization. Quality, price, 
productivity, timely delivery, after-sales services, robust design, etc., are crucial for business organizations in a 
highly competitive market. Therefore, business organizations are forced to enhance their products and processes by 
continuously adopting the latest business improvement strategies and bringing innovations. Some of such 
improvement strategies are Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), Lean 
Manufacturing, Six Sigma methodology, Total Quality Management (TQM), Agile Manufacturing, Integrated 
Management System (IMS), etc. Lean Six Sigma has unfolded as one of such improvement strategies in the last two 
decades. 
According to a few research studies, Lean and Six Sigma grew independently during the previous century and 
emerged as quality improvement approaches (Albliwi et al. 2015; Alkunsol et al. 2019; Chakrabarty and Leyer 
2013). Both the approaches, i.e., Lean and Six Sigma, have been adopted by various business organizations to 
improve products and processes with different tools and techniques (Walter and Paladini 2019). However, the Lean 
Six Sigma methodology employed the principles, tools and techniques of both approaches jointly to improve the 
quality, productivity, and customer satisfaction, maximizing the value to all the stakeholders (Laureani and Antony 
2012). Recently conducted review studies concluded significant popularity of Lean Six Sigma methodology as a 
continuous improvement strategy based on significant growth in research articles published in peer-reviewed 
academic journals in the last decades (Panayiotou and Stergiou 2020; Patel and Patel 2021a; Raja Sreedharan and 
Raju 2016; Raval et al. 2018; Shokri 2017). In addition, Lean Six Sigma deployment in various sized business 
organizations, i.e., small, medium, and large-sized organizations, has increased various sectors like manufacturing, 
service, private, and public sectors (Laureani and Antony 2019). Implementing Lean Six Sigma in large-scale 
business organizations is reported better than in small and medium-scale business organizations (Kumar et al. 2011; 
Sambhe and Dalu 2011). Henceforth, it is essential to explore and understand the vital failure factors for Lean Six 
Sigma implementation through research.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to investigate and provide a comprehensive understanding of the many factors and 
c h a l l e n g e s  that affect applying TQM principles in the public sector. This objective will be 
achieved throughout the duration of this research. Initially, we anticipate that the study will focus on TQM

Abstract 
In-vehicle handling one of the most important systems is the steering system. Typically, all vehicles have a steering 
system that allows the vehicle to be turned to either side, that is, left or right. In this paper, an idea of implemented 
considering a steering system for the rear wheel in addition to the front wheel, resulting in a four-wheel steering 
system. The turning radius required for four-wheel steering is less than that necessary for front-wheel steering after 
evaluating the effect of the four-wheel steering system. Some cars use four-wheel steering to improve steering 
response, increase vehicle stability while driving at high speeds, or reduce turning radius while maneuvering at low 
speeds. However, the improvement in turning radius is discussed using Ackermann steering geometry (ASG), from 
which the wheel critical turning angles are calculated for minimum turning radius. The steering system is implemented 
using a rack and pinion mechanism, and the design of the pinion and rack are obtained from ASG. In the study, the 
vehicle behavior for 4-wheel steering is done using a physical prototype and MATLAB Simulink model. Also, the 
steering of the front and rear wheel is performed using a servo motor which is controlled by the microcontroller. The 
vehicle's turning radius is reduced by 33% due to the four-wheel steering system. Improvements have also been made 
in high-speed handling while changing lane with the four-wheel steering system, in which excessive lateral 
displacement has been reduced by 77% and reduce the time required to change the lane. Also, the study of these forces 
for the four-wheel steering system is discussed for low-speed maneuvering.

1. Introduction
The steering system is the most important component of any vehicle. It allows the driver to have complete control 
over the vehicle’s maneuvering. The steering function is to steer the vehicle with the manual input to the steering 
wheel. The majority of vehicles, including cars, trucks, tractors, and other vehicles, have front-wheel steering.  Except 
for special purpose vehicles, front-wheel steering input has been utilized to control the direction of vehicles since the 
invention of the automobile. Because of its importance in managing vehicle dynamics, yaw stability management of 
the vehicle is one of the intriguing challenges to focus on in this scenario. It is generally known that a simple bicycle 
model which can be used to examine the vehicle's maneuvering and handling stability dynamics. In four-wheel 
steering systems, a mechatronics system steers the rear wheels. While turning using four-wheel steering system wheels 
rotate by angle ∆θ1,∆θ2 and ∆θ3,∆θ4 for the front-wheel and rear-wheel respectively. This study shows vehicle steering 
at low and high speeds, with the low-speed study demonstrate the vehicle’s turning radius can be reduce, which is 
useful for parking and U-turns.

Figure 15. Physical prototype test runs for low-speed turning performance 
 
For the measurement of turning radius marker pen was attached to rear side of the vehicle as shown in Figure 15. As 
vehicle drives the traces of the marker appeared on the floor. Circle trace by vehicle at low speed is of radius 400mm. 
The difference in the radius of the simulation result and the physical prototype is due to design and manufacturing 
constraints.  
 
9. Conclusion 
It has been observed that system design for four-wheel steering employing Ackermann steering geometry 
mathematically satisfies the ideal steering condition. Also, the following points are concluded: 
• A four-wheel steering vehicle, a smaller turning radius minimizes the time it takes to turn the vehicle. 
• It has been noted that the circle trace by the four-wheel steering is of radius 350 mm and the ellipse trace by front-
wheel steering is of radius 525mm. 
• Steering on all four wheels at high speed, the vehicle’s lateral movement is faster and more stable than when 
steering on the front wheels. 
A reduction in turning is noted as a function of the yaw position and yaw rate. This concludes that the four-wheel 
steering system helps to reduce the turning radius of the vehicle by approximately 33%. There are also improvements 
in high-speed maneuvering; while these results are likewise observed for the prototype; the physical prototype the 
turning radius of the vehicle is reduced by approximately 35%; given that the prototype is a scaled-down version of 
the actual car, it can be conclude that the calculations for the prototype are also applicable for the actual vehicle. Also, 
it has been observed that the stability of vehicle factors is different for low-speed and high-speed. Also, the normal 
force and lateral forces were affected while vehicle steering.  
• 
The normal and lateral forces increase with increased velocity. 
• 
The low-speed maneuvering normal and lateral forces affect the vehicle stability 
• 
The suitable turning for the four-wheel steering vehicle is 18km/hr.

Abstract 
The Battery chargers are an important component in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and various other clean 
energy systems. The thermal management in the battery charger is a crucial aspect that influences its overall 
performance and cyclic stability. Passive cooling technology using heat sinks is preferred in developing battery 
chargers due to its reliability, quietness, and efficiency. In the present work, new hybrid passive heat sinks with 
various fin geometries namely inclined interrupted fins, pin fins, and straight interrupted fins, have been developed 
by adding a phase change material layer to passively cooled bare fin heat sinks. The developed heat sinks have the 
same geometric footprint as that of the battery charger; IC650 was built by the industrial partner of the project Delta-
Q Technologies. Simulations were carried out to analyze the effects of PCM quantities for thermal loads on the 
heating-cooling performance of the HPHS using Ansys fluent 19.1 commercially available software to validate the 
experimental results from the literature study. Inclined interrupted fin design found more effective in terms of 
thermal performance among all considered configurations.

1. Introduction
The electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid vehicle markets are developing rapidly to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, 
with a projected reduction of 200 million tons of oil equivalent by 2030. (Alawadhi and amon 2000) Demand for 
EVs is expected to increase by 20% in the coming decades. (Ali et al. 2018) This requires technological advances in 
the design of electric drive units and improved charging infrastructure. In recent years, the miniaturization of 
electronic components, as well as the improvement of their performance, have led to the emergence of high-
performance devices with high packing density.(Benyamin et al. 2021) Therefore thermal management of electric 
vehicles is an important issue which is needed to be addressed as not the only battery but other components E-
motors, controllers, and onboard Ev chargers generate numerous amounts of heat.(Bunsen et al. 2019) hence there is 
a need to develop an effective cooling system for thermal management of onboard Ev chargers.  
Notable research work has been carried out using different passive and active cooling systems i.e. air cooling, liquid 
cooling, heat pipe cooling, refrigeration, thermoelectric, and the use of thermal conductivity enhancers in finned 
cooling is done. However, PCM cooling remains the foremost selection based on its high-energy storage density. 
(Farzanehnia et al. 2019) The key selection for a proper PCM requires both high latent heat and thermal 
conductivity in order to store and reject with facility the heat. Phase change materials-based heat sinks are emerging 
as one the effective techniques for the removal of heat from electronic devices. Current research focuses on 
improving the thermal performance of heat sink models using PCM as a thermal conductivity improver. The effect 
of various parameters influencing the performance of TCE-PCM-based heat sinks needs to be studied in systematic 
order. 
1.1 Objectives 
In literature different fin configurations were investigated where it is found that most of the work has been done by 
use of PCM on microprocessor chips, fin submerged in PCM is used as Thermal conductivity Enhancers to improve 
the heat transfer characteristics of PCM enclosed in containers and use of PCM-Air hybrid heat sink design which 
combines the effect of fin interaction with the PCM & ambient. This design facilitates continuous heat dissipation 
from the heat sink to the ambient via natural/forced convection. From the research study, it’s found that the

5.4 Validation  
Validation of the numerical model is shown in Figures 7 and 8. The simulation is carried out without PCM 
conditions on the Heat sink model available in the literature. The straight interrupted finned heat sink model is 
analyzed for the same boundary conditions which were used for experimentation. From the graph it is found that 
results are matching closely with an accuracy of 10-15%.

6. Conclusion  
In the present study hybrid design of heat sink is developed for real industrial onboard Ev charger using paraffin 
wax as a PCM. The effect of PCM quantity over different geometries is compared with the finned heat sink design. 
Viz. inclined interrupted, straight interrupted, and pin fin was analyzed at different thermal loads. The following 
conclusions were drawn from the study: 
 
For finned heat sink without PCM condition Inclined interrupted FHS delivered the best performance followed by 
Circular and Straight interrupted FHS for a thermal load of 80 W. At higher thermal loads of 100 W and 120 W, the 
shape of the temperature profiles for Inclined interrupted, Circular, and Straight interrupted FHS is similar to that at 
80 W, except that the slopes of the temperature profiles are higher. Overall, the thermal performance of inclined 
interrupted FHS at all the thermal loads was found to be higher than for Circular and Straight interrupted FHS. 
 
Using Phase change Materials based hybrid heat sink design offers potential in cooling electronic devices compared 
to traditional methods.so by using PCM as a thermal conductivity enhancer in finned heat sink design reduce heating 
rate and peak temperatures of the heat sink thus electronic devices can have longer usage. It is concluded that less 
peak is observed in the contours of temperature with PCM as a TCE for a given time period. So, maximum thermal 
performance is achieved and reduce thermal stresses in heat sink. 
 
Thermal conductance calculated at different thermal power levels for three different configurations was higher for 
pin fin configuration at 80 W i.e. 0.72 and for straight interrupted fin configuration at 100 W i.e. 0.69

Abstract 
This study was undertaken to examine the Influence of Perceived Organizational Support and Turnover Intention on 
Employee Performance in a Telecommunications Firm. The study employed descriptive and causal quantitative 
research. The sample was picked based on non-random criteria, also known as non-probability sampling, whereas the 
sampling technique employed was purposive sampling. The data were descriptively evaluated, and the hypotheses 
were tested by regression analysis using SPSS version 26. Each indicator, perceived organizational support, turnover 
intention, and employee performance, has been proven to fall under the ""good"" category by the study. Additionally, 
the study demonstrates that both perceived organizational support and intention to leave have a considerable impact 
on employee performance when they are perceived concurrently and partially.

1. Introduction
As a result of the fierce competition in the industrial sector, businesses are becoming more discerning in their selection 
of human resources. Due to the dynamic nature of the workplace, companies prioritize individuals who can work 
flexibly and in teams; therefore, individuals with capable behavior are required to lighten the workload of other team 
members, be interested in doing more work, avoid conflicts with coworkers, comply with regulations, and have a high 
tolerance for workplace disturbances that may occur (Fakhri et al., 2021). 
Perceived organizational support is how much employees think their company appreciates what they do and cares 
about their well-being. It shows how employees and companies deal with each other (Eisenberger & Stinglhamber, 
2011). How employees feel about their company's support depends on their willingness to reward their job 
participation and meet their need for praise and approval. HRM (human resources management) practices that focus 
on investing in employees, letting them take part in making decisions, and giving them chances to grow to make 
employees feel supported by their companies and like they're part of a social exchange relationship (Cunningham & 
Barbee, 2000). So, when perceived organizational support works well, employees are more likely to see their 
organizations as supportive and can be creative and increase employee performance. When employees think their 
companies are very supportive, they are more likely to show trust and confidence, which makes them more likely to 
come up with creative ideas and suggestions (Organ, 1997).  
As these organizations are seen to accept failure and trial-and-error methods and encourage creativity and risk-taking, 
employees are more likely to feel psychologically safe taking the lead or being creative (Bedarkar & Pandita, 2014). 
Also, employees who get much organizational support are more likely to be in a good mood, which makes it easier 
for them to be creative. Also, they are more willing to talk to and interact with other people, which helps them learn 
more and come up with more creative ideas. They tend to be more interested in their work, which makes them 
enthusiastic about promoting creative ideas. On the other hand, employees who think their organizations aren't very 
supportive tend to think that their organizations don't value their creative contributions, so they don't try as hard to be 
creative (Ajzen, 1991).

The R value is 0.616, and R Square (R2) is 0.369, as shown in Table 3. This value serves as a benchmark for 
determining the simultaneous influence of Perceived organizational support and Turnover intention on Employee 
performance. These results indicate the effect of the Independent Variables, consisting of Perceived organizational 
support and Turnover intention, on the Bound Variables, namely Employee performance; the effect is 36.9 percent, 
with the remaining 63.1 percent attributable to the influence of other factors not investigated in this study. 
5. Conclusion
Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the perceived organizational support (X1) variable is 
included in the Good category. The turnover intention Variable (X2) is included in the high category. The variable 
employee performance (Y) is included in the Good category. The results of hypothesis testing indicate that perceived 
organizational support and turnover intention, either partially or simultaneously, have a significant effect on the 
dependent variable, namely employee performance.

1. Introduction
Currently, the development of the skincare industry in Indonesia is accelerating. Although the Covid-19 pandemic has 
had a big impact on the economy, it has had little effect on the demand for cosmetics, particularly skincare products, 
which are expected to have considerable growth and have a direct impact on the high demand for skincare products. 
This is due to the fact that caring for facial skin is a need for some people, and having bright, healthy, and radiant 
facial skin is every woman's goal. Even among males, the skincare trend thrives due to the significant interest in facial 
skin care. The current rapid growth of the beauty sector in Indonesia demands that businesses be able to thrive among 
the existing competition. This study focuses on Everwhite, an Indonesian brand of skincare products already relatively 
well-known. Everwhite offers an extensive selection of facial and body care products. Everwhite company's marketing 
strategy is particularly distinctive in that it employs promotions to pique customer strategy in its skincare products. 
Everwhite employs celebrities, specifically South Korean actors, as Brand Ambassadors in its aired product 
advertising. This Brand Ambassador is anticipated to raise customer curiosity, boost consumer confidence in the 
everwhite product and brand, and generate public purchasing interest. 
Brand image, brand ambassadors, and product quality are among the external factors that influence purchase intention. 
Consumer purchase intention is a person's intention to acquire a product or service after careful consideration before 
the purchase (Pradana et al., 2020). Meanwhile, a brand ambassador is passionate about the brand and can influence 
and invite consumers to purchase or utilize a product (Putri et al., 2021). In order to enhance consumer interest in a 
product, the brand ambassador must exert a positive influence. The brand image of a product also affects consumer 
interest. Brand image is the consequence of consumer opinions or perceptions of a certain brand, which are based on 
comparisons with other brands or products of the same sort. According to Faircloth et al. (2001), brand image is the 
perception that arises in a client's mind while recalling a brand from a product. With a positive brand image, consumers 
will be interested in the brand and have a positive opinion of it. The product quality also influences purchase intention. 
Product quality is the capability of a product to meet or surpass consumer expectations. Consumers expect high-quality 
products, which must be met. As a result of the fact that product quality is the key to increasing corporate productivity.

In order to analyze the influence between Brand Ambassador, Brand Image, and Product Quality on Purchase 
Intention, the multiple regression analysis equations is described as follows: 
 
Y = -0,388 + 0,394X1 + 0,256X2 + 0,429X3 
The value of the constant (α) is -0.388. If brand ambassador, brand image, and product quality are worth as 0 point 
then the purchase intention of Everwhite skincare consumers is worth -0.388. The value of the regression coefficient 
X1 (brand ambassador) is 0.394 which is positive, meaning that the variable has a direct relationship with the variable 
Y (purchase intention), and each increase of one unit X1 (brand ambassador) will increase the variable Y (purchase 
intention) by 0.394. The value of the regression coefficient X2 (brand image) is 0.256, which is positive, meaning that 
the variable has a unidirectional relationship with the variable Y (purchase intention), and each increase in unit X2  
(brand image) will increase the variable Y (purchase intention) by 0.256. The value of the regression coefficient X3 
(product quality) is 0.429, which is positive, meaning that the variable has a unidirectional relationship with the 
variable Y (purchase intention), and each increase in units of product quality will increase the variable Y (purchase 
intention) by 0.429.

Based on the calculations that have been made, it can be known that Fvalue > Ftable (91.249 > 2.70) and the 
significance level is 0.000 < 0.05 (Table 2). This shows that H0 is rejected, and Ha is accepted, meaning that 
independent variables consisting of Brand Ambassador, Brand Image, and Product Quality simultaneously 
significantly influence Purchase Intention.
