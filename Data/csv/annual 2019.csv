ABSTRACT 
In agricultural products, cotton is a cash crop for farmers. Cotton is environmentally a highly sensitive crop and 
is under risk from the effects of global warming and the intensive use of synthetic inputs. Due to global warming 
and climate change, the production of cotton is shrinking in the world’s largest cotton producing countries such 
as China, India, USA and Pakistan. In the overall cotton supply chain management (CSCM) system, immediate 
sustainable measures are required for protecting the textile industry and the livelihoods of cotton industry 
stakeholders. Based on a thorough review of the literature, a cotton supply chain management cycle at both the 
farm level, and the industry overall, was developed in this study. A sustainable Cotton Supply Chain Management 
Framework (CSCMF) is developed in this study for farm level production by identifying the Critical Success 
Factors (CSF’s) in the literature review, with subsequent interviews with six technical experts who were 
experienced in small, medium, and large farming enterprises, categorised under the headings of sustainability, 
supply chain management and cotton farming. The CSFs identified were classified in terms of cotton supply chain 
management under the three sustainability pillars of social, economic and environmental sustainability. This 
CSCM Framework will be useful to inform the future development of sustainability policies, and the assessment 
of farmers’ behavior, regarding sustainable practices

1. Introduction
Cotton is a soft, fluffy staple fiber which is usually spun into yarn or thread and used to make a soft,
breathable textile cloth. Cotton is a cash crop for a large number of farmers and farming enterprises and is an 
essential raw material for the survival and expansion of textile industry. More than 100 countries in the world 
have been producing cotton for more than 100 years, with almost 75% of total production coming from China, 
India, USA and Pakistan (Sameer Safaya, May, 2016). Worldwide cotton production in 2013-14 was 26.23 million 
tonnes, decreasing to 22.03 million tonnes in 2015-16 (Zulfiqar and Thapa, 2018). The major reasons for this 
tremendous decrease in overall cotton production, identified by researchers, are climate change and non-
sustainable utilization of resources. Sustainability is the process of maintaining change in a balanced manner, in 
which the exploitation of resources, the direction of investments, the orientation of technological development 
and institutional change are all in harmony and enhance both current and future potential to meet human needs 
and aspirations. Usually, sustainability involves three paradigms of social, economic and environmental 
sustainability (Yang and Mei, 2017). Sustainability objectives seek to compel development in terms of economic 
growth, social progress, protection of the environment, and use of natural resources in a prudent way (Vasileiou 
and Morris, 2006). Sustainable development means to meet the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their needs. 
The cotton supply chain management process includes the production of raw cotton (at the farm level), 
cotton ginning, spinning, weaving, dying, cutting, sewing to create products, retailing, and branding of cotton 
products (shirts, jeans etc.) (Zulfiqar and Thapa, 2018). Efficient and effective textile raw material delivery must 
enable sustainability in the production process and the overall supply chain management, from point of origin to 
point of consumption. Sustainable cotton supply chain is a competitive, efficient, and safe way of production, 
while ensuring the protecting of environmental, social, and economic conditions of communities (Platform, 2013). 
In the entire cotton supply chain cycle, farm level production has been responsible for producing 56% of emissions

5. Conclusions 
Cotton production sustainability is a serious challenge for developing countries such as India and Pakistan. 
Through different campaigns and serious United Nations (UN) programs, many countries, and industries, are 
collectively putting their efforts into the achievement of sustainability in every field of life. The agriculture sector 
is the most concerning and most directly affected industry, and requires serious attention to sustainability and 
sustainable practices. Cotton production is one of the most unsustainable agricultural industries due to the normal 
practices for heavy use of insecticides and pesticides, and the poor knowledge of small farmers of sustainable 
practices. To overcome these problems, social development programs by Non-government organizations (NGO’s) 
have acknowledged the importance of sustainable cotton production and they are endeavoring to expand 
sustainable practices through foreign and domestic stakeholders like BCI. By developing a model of the social, 
economic and environmental sustainability paradigms, recognizing the Critical Success Factors essential in the 
farm level cotton supply chain, we are confident that this model can inform government policy and assist farm 
level stakeholders to achieve sustainable production practices. It must be acknowledged that the success of this 
model of sustainability depends on farmers’ behavior and acceptance. Farmer awareness, level of education, 
attitude to risk, size of farms and other relevant matters must be explored and understood, and a government 
sustainability policy framework developed, to fulfil the growing demand of sustainable cotton production. Our 
model provides a basis for such policies and practices.

Abstract 
Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a methodology used for product and process design, by 
identifying the potential failure modes and prioritizing them, subsequently reduce the error in the process. 
The failure consequence is quantified in terms of Risk Priority Number (RPN), a product of occurrence, 
severity, and detection difficulty. This approach to FMEA lacks the quantification of costs of potential 
occurrence of specified failure modes and costs of their analysis. In manufacturing, the RPN measurement 
provides little or no meaning as the failure quantification on the basis of cost may be more meaningful. 
This paper describes the modification to the methodology of FMEA process in a cost-oriented manner, 
which takes into account the economic aspects of potential failure of the machine component. Three 
consequences of the failure of components are considered; failure will result in conditions where machine 
is immediately stopped (F1), leads to reduction in speed (F2) and affecting product quality (F3). Expected 
annual cost index based on the failure consequence is calculated to identify the criticality of the 
components. An application of the cost oriented FMEA is presented for a press machine manufacturing 
auto components.

Abstract 
With the launch of e-commerce, market has experienced steady surge in consumer durables but it has shortened product life 
cycle due to rapid changes in features and capabilities. Refurbished items can generate additional revenue for the company 
while two major drawbacks could be, first, reduced future demand for the newer products and second capacity limitations 
of the manufacturers. Manufacturers always have inventory holding and sales constraints and additional accumulating 
inventory of returned product can be difficult to carry over to next periods. This creates a problem of optimal launch of 
refurbished products to effectively use the capacity limitation without influencing the sales of newly launched products. We 
propose to formulate an optimization model to find market launch time of refurbished products constrained over profit and 
capacity by three steps. First an analysis of the time series distribution is done to depict its influence over sales. Secondly, 
using Bass Diffusion Model as a base form for the sales distribution a convolution of sales curve is presented stating the 
time and capacity at which the refurbished products needs to be released into the market. Finally, a forecasting method is 
presented to determine the inventory holding capacity at instantaneous time depending on the market demand.

Abstract 
In cooperation with the recent prevalence of electric vehicles (EVs), researches focus on location planning for EV 
charging stations are being conducted actively. Fundamental in most relevant studies is that demand is associated with 
population. However, alongside a viewpoint that users of a facility are vehicles, traffic flow would be a primary 
instance which arises demand. Given a region, we consider a road network with links and nodes associated with roads 
and intersections. Given an origin-destination pair, each traffic shall flow on the shortest path. In this context, there is 
a concept called cannibalization, reflecting multiple facilities deprive the others of demand flowing on the same single 
path. A model explaining this phenomenon is called the flow-capturing location-allocation model (FCLM). 
Meanwhile, EVs have a significant constraint which should be taken into account in formulation; their driving distance 
is shorter than gasoline-powered vehicles. Thus, it is not adequate to apply the FCLM as it is to EVs. In light of this, 
we propose a new location-allocation model designed for EV charging stations. The model is an outgrowth of the 
standard FCLM, for which an out-of-battery situation does not occur. The distance between multiple facilities 
allocated on same path is minimized.

Abstract 
Nowadays, one of the objectives of fleet management is to reduce fleet size and costs and to improve efficiency at the 
level of assignment, scheduling, and routing. In this paper, we present a literature review focusing on solution methods 
by analyzing 245 journal papers dealing with exact methods as well as heuristics and metaheuristics to solve large 
instances of two main problems in this area, namely the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and the Multi Depot Vehicle 
Scheduling Problem (MDVSP). 
Keywords 
Fleet management, VRP, MDVSP, heuristics, metaheuristics. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Fleet management often includes apart from the management of vehicles, the management of drivers as well. Its
optimization allows improving the productivity of a company. Transportation professionals have to reduce their costs 
while, satisfying all kinds of constraints such as scheduling, capacity, time windows, maintenance, regulation, service 
level, quality constraints. In this review, we are interested in vehicle scheduling and routing problems, with the 
objective of optimizing the assignment of resources to routes and to control fleet size, according to several criteria. 
A wide volume of research work in this area focus on the vehicle scheduling and routing problems at the same 
time. This article is a review of the literature published between 2010 and 2018 on VRP, and the literature published 
between 2015 and 2018 on MDVSP. It is presented in such a way that it specifies the variant of the problem that is 
studied as well as the solution method that is used.

Others* contains other solutions methods not often used, such as a Customized heuristic algorithm; Simulation-based 
evaluation method; a Multi-cut L-shaped based algorithm; a Clonal selection algorithm; exact algorithm based on the 
trip-chain-oriented set-partitioning;  a Partition algorithm; Differential evolution algorithms ; and others metaheuristic 
algorithm. 
We notice that the column generation method is the most used for solving scheduling problems, which is normal 
because this method solves effectively large linear optimization problems like most variants of the MDVSP; but 
generates the phenomenon of degeneracy, which must be combated with other methods.

5. CONCLUSION 
In the present time, transportation management has become increasingly important, especially when we take into 
consideration the increase in demography and human development, which generate high demands. Therefore, plants 
implantations have become exponential to meet these demands, making logistics management difficult in terms of 
supply, shipping, and transportation of personnel; as there are several modes of transportation, this management 
becomes much more complicated to manage. In our paper, we are interested in the VRP and MDVSP, because they 
have a common objective which is to reduce the fleet size and then to reduce the costs. The objective of this literature 
review is to give an idea about the solution methods that have been used to tackle such problems in recent papers in 
this area.

Abstract 
During the wheelset maintenance process, the number of the axles is reduced by scrapping which makes it difficult to 
comply with the wagon maintenance plan. To re–establish the number of wheelsets, it is necessary to purchase new 
axles at a cost U$ 2,386.36 per unit. The average number of scrap axles is 26.44 units or 5.4% per month, which raises 
the maintenance costs of the wagons. Thus, the problem was identified, the goal was defined based on history, and it 
was stratified with tree diagram, pareto, sequential graph, boxplot and histogram. From the tree diagram, we identified 
the components involved with the problem of the high scrap rate of axle 6.1/2x12 by groove in the sleeve. Then, the 
brainstorming session of the causes of the groove was elaborated, the causes were prioritized for study by correlation, 
q-square test, boxplot, histogram and soft flexion test. Then, the proven causes for treatment, elaboration and effective
action plan were prioritized. The result was that, while 3,03% of the groove axes studied were scrapped up to 5.47
months, 35.43% of the tested axles (127 units) went through this period without groove. The expenditure avoided with
the 127 axles of the sample was about U$ 223,810.98. The projected avoided expenditure 4 years (large scale
application) is about U$ 1,562,583.81. The completion of the work was by the pilot test and serves as a basis for large-
scale application of the solution in the fleet.

Scrap, Axle, Groove, Railroad, Maintenance. 
1. Introduction
The scrapping of wagon’s axles is common in railroads and has a significantly high impact in the maintenance costs. 
Therefore, it is highly important to identify the root causes of this problem utilizing robust methodologies and the 
implementation of actions that are effective in their elimination. For that, we tackled this challenge using the 6 Sigma 
method, grounded on PDCA, understanding the whole process and data collection, using statistic soft, with chi square 
distribution, histogram, boxplot, normal probability, correlation (dispersion diagram), tree diagram, pareto chart,

The period studied was based between 2016 January to 2017 April with great occur of the axles scrap. See wheelset 
image in (Figure 1) compound per axle, wheel and bearing, where occur the scrap trouble. 
To minimize the scrap, the objective was determined based on the historical analysis in the first quarter method, due 
in a few months the reach was below the goal by the gap method. 
Gap method is (average + minimum) / 2 = (5.4+2.3)/2 = 3.85%.

9. Conclusion 
 
The axis flexion is the largest responsible for the generation of groove, but due to its resolution in changing the 
design of the axle, it becomes something very expensive, then remains to control the dimension of the wear rings 
and backing ring to allow interference between them and the axis, eliminating the contact wear that originates the 
groove. Thus, maintaining interferences between these elements will be the way to avoid groove on axle.

Abstract: 
Many organisations perceive enterprise resource planning (ERP) as a potential, vital and crucial solution to their 
businesses to gain efficiencies and be competitive. ERP implementation can reap enormous benefits, or it can be 
disastrous for organisations that fail to manage the implementation process. The adoption of a new ERP system is 
a highly complex process, and it is not as easy as people imagine, it is a challenging task that requires rigorous 
efforts, a careful thinking, and proper planning; also it demands to have a detailed analysis of such factors that are 
critical to the implementation. The field has invoked immense interest in the research community, and several 
previous studies have tried to assess the success of these systems and highlight the CSF's based on some theoretical 
models. A better understanding of the CSFs will shrink the field of failure and help the practitioners and managers 
to improve the chance of success. The purpose of this study is to form a basis for future studies which may help 
future ERP initiatives to achieve greater success and less failure, it seeks to investigate the critical success factors 
of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation, and then determine what factors are the most highly 
correlated with the success of ERP projects. To evaluate each element, we used a statistical data analysis. The 
approach used in this research consisted of both a quantitative and qualitative analysis, the study consisted of a 
literature review. The data collected were analyzed, and several conclusions were drawn.

Introduction: 
Nowadays, Organizations are increasingly dependent on ERP system. It occupies a growing place in today's 
businesses, whether large or small and medium-sized enterprises. The main goal that drives companies to 
implement an ERP system is to adopt a single and consistent system to centralize information and facilitate their 
circulation. The deployment of an ERP system is supposed to provide the company with more flexible 
management, an improvement of the productivity and thus to obtain a competitive advantage on their market. It’s 
now a tool for standardization of business processes and multinational groups and offers rich and proven features 
based on best practices. 
Despite the many benefits of this solution, the rate of success of the implementation project announced by 
organizations is sobering: it was reported that three-quarters of the ERP projects were judged to be unsuccessful 
by the ERP implementing firms (Hong et al., 2002). ,ERP projects that fail are rare, but few succeed in achieving 
all the objectives announced at the beginning of the project, and as a result, the solution which is a source of 
productivity and performance for companies, becomes a break in some of them.

Abstract 
This paper develops a mathematical model based on inventory routing problem that aims to minimise 
transportation cost, inventory carrying cost and optimises delivery schedules in a retail Australian industry. 
A supply chain is considered which comprises of a single distribution centre, having homogenous fleet of 
vehicles, supplying a single product to multiple retailers having deterministic demand. The mathematical 
model takes into account varying level of road congestion.

1. Introduction
The Australian logistics industry contributes to 8.6 per cent of the GDP, adding $131.6 billion to the Australian 
economy in 2013. Productivity improvement of 1 per cent is estimated to increase the Australian GDP by $2 billion 
(Allen 2014).  However, increase in competition and reduction of profit margin has posed a significant challenge to 
the transport industry and optimisation of individual businesses no longer yields increased efficiency. Companies are 
now forced to locate efficiency improvements for entire supply chains rather than focusing on improvement at each 
successive echelon by sharing information beyond prices and tariffs (Andersson et al. 2010). Information shared 
includes consumption patterns, inventory status, sales forecast and profit margins. Thus the competition has shifted 
away from individual businesses to competition between entire supply chains, with each actors in the supply chain 
opting for profit sharing (Alaei & Setak 2015) rather than individual profit maximisation avoiding suboptimal 
solutions (Stadtler 2015). 
Apart from cost of transportation, another significant cost incurred in the transport industry is the cost of inventory. 
According to Brown (2011), on average a company incurs an inventory carrying cost of 10 per cent of the value of 
the inventory.

with different average speed of vehicle, to mimic the effect of traffic. This model was solved by incorporating the 
VNS heuristic. A computational time of under 95 seconds was achieved, allowing application of this model for tactical 
level decision making process. Impact of speed penalties was observed by comparing objective solution for each time 
interval with the objective solution for the entire day.  
 
The model performed as per its requirement, however, given the increase in computational time for increased number 
of customers, the variable neighbourhood search heuristic applied can be deemed insufficient and possibility of 
incorporation of a hybrid heuristic is felt.  
 
Application of IRP in the Australian logistics industry will have a significant impact in productivity improvements, 
while cutting down unnecessary costs. Australia already suffers increased prices of goods as compared to other 
countries due to its geographical location. By incorporating tools like IRP, local supply chains can achieve competitive 
prices of products and aim to compete in the international market. 
 
Future variants of this model can incorporate real-time traffic conditions using API provided by Google Maps. 
Average speed for each time interval can be determined by taking average speed of vehicles travelling from the route 
in real-time, which can yield real-time routing of the vehicle via global positioning system (GPS). This can further be 
enhanced via use of radio frequency identification devices (RFID) which can be used to provide real-time information 
regarding inventory levels, and by incorporating data obtained from point of sale (POS) terminals, a live tool can be 
created, which will optimise every movement of inventory from supplier to retailer.

Abstract 
The study takes place at a steel production company in Mexico, where the market has a deficit for its collection 
capabilities. This project focuses on the redesign of the logistics system in charge of the collection of raw material, 
which is done by the company owned fleet. The initial diagnostic phases had the purpose of identifying the root 
causes of the problem at hand. They involved collecting and analyzing data regarding the providers, processing 
factories, costs and the process involved with the collection system. The key action taken was to establish a new 
venture of collaborative economy as a mean for scaling the collection capabilities. In addition, a new planning and 
operations scheme was implemented using a software application for better routing. It includes a prioritized provider 
selection based on performance, fleet management, and data gathering with integrated analytics. The results after a 
pilot period were a decrease in the logistics costs by 14.48%, a decrease in the average kilometers driven per ton by 
27.4%, and an increase in collection capacity by 8%.

Introduction 
Nowadays, technology and human life cannot be separated; society has a cyclical co-dependence on technology, 
since it has solved and facilitated many daily and operational tasks. Technology is constantly changing and 
updating, impacting the environment, people and the society alike; although the way people use it, determines if it 
impacts in a positive or negative way. In this case, it is known that transportation is one of the basic areas that has 
been implementing technological solutions, having benefited both the society and businesses with these updated 
practices. Transportation provides mobility for people and goods, and like all other technologies, can be viewed as a 
system, since it is composed of a series of parts that are interrelated that work together to meet a certain goal. 
Technology has been key for creating the globalized world of today. Thanks to this, new business models are 
emerging and attracting the attention of investors and the public in general. More and more companies are 
replicating these different business models to adapt to society and survive as a profitable venture, as they try and 
keep up with technology, which each day, evolves faster than before. An example of a business model that is 
disrupting the market is the collaborative economy, which refers to an economic system in which goods and services 
are shared and exchanged through digital platforms, while the companies providing the business become only 
connection between third parties, that are in need for a network big enough to earn a living, with the clients. Such as 
the author Morgan (2014) says, “The digital revolution generates new productive relationships and transforms the 
economy, in a few years perhaps all we need to earn a living is a humble connection to the Internet”. Each different 
industry may adapt the model to become the first company to apply something so different from competitors that 
may launch them to the next level. 
The company in study is a world-class steel production company in Mexico founded in 1952. It has an integrated 
infrastructure for the collection and processing of scrap, steel mills, plants that manufacture finished products and

Figure 7. ROI simulation results 
 
The figure 7 shows that the results were promising, considering that the best three scenarios had a ROI before the 
course of two years. The final ROI rates for two years of operations were: Optimist (3,031%), Good (1,165%), 
Normal (602%) and for the Bad scenario (-49%). This highly volatile rates are caused by the low development costs 
of the application, since it will be done by in house developers from the company in study.  
 
Together the solutions provided a reduction of 13.32% the first year and later of 14.48% off the logistics cost and of 
27.4% in the number of kilometers traveled. The Scrap Collecting App will also provide savings, as its scenario 
simulation showed, but these results are not taking directly into consideration for the reduction of logistic cost, since 
this affects mainly the purchase cost and the extra capacity that the company will be able to collect. The savings in 
cost logistics are measured in this solution, but this is an opportunity saving since, now these additional scrap tons 
won’t require the Roll Off truck operations.

Conclusions 
As conclusions of the project it can be observed that the results were positive and satisfactory for the company, the 
expected and the additional ones. There was a quite complex and interesting development which during this time it 
was possible to observe how interesting it was to carry out this project, in addition to all the knowledge acquired and 
put into development on our part. Although the project had a different approach at first, after the analysis and what 
was discovered as it was progressing is that you can conclude and observe that the company feels satisfied and 
happy with the work that has been done. The time invested, and the tools used were many, in addition to the 
interaction and communication with the staff of the company. The treatment and experience within the company was 
quite positive and has helped that the knowledge acquired and applied during this time in the project are very useful 
for the future that is coming. So much so that the same company has approached to make an offer on job offers to be 
able to give continuity to the project.

Abstract 
Currently, it is a common practice within transport companies to reduce fuel consumption of their fleet by awarding 
best drivers with public symbolic recognitions, as part of their programs to promote efficient driving. Usually fuel 
economy (FE) is the key performance indicator used to evaluate them. However, FE depends on several other 
parameters such as the working route, vehicle weight and vehicle technology. Therefore, companies with a diverse 
fleet composition require a fair KPI to select their best drivers. 
In this work, we present a model to assess drivers’ performance based on FE measurements. Based on multivariate 
statistical analysis of one-year FE data of an urban and interurban bus transit company, we found that drivers’ FE 
exhibit a normal distribution when they are grouped within three categories:  (a) the route, representing the driving 
cycle; (b) the vehicle age, representing the engine technology, and (c) the number of axles, representing the weight of 
the vehicle. Thus, the standard statistical analysis to identify outliers was used to identify best drivers and vehicles 
that require maintenance.

Abstract  
 
Using the theoretical perspective of the Regional Innovation System (RIS), this paper analyzes the structure of the aerospace 
industry in Mexico, focusing on the region of Querétaro, Mexico. The objective of the research is to analyze the development, 
growth prospects, key agents and their interrelations of the aerospace industry in the Queretaro region from the perspective of the 
RIS. The aerospace industry in Querétaro has more than 40 companies, research centers and universities, intermediate and 
government agencies that focus on the aerospace industry, the region has presented rates of economic growth above the national 
average in the last 6 years, however to achieve the consolidation of the aerospace industry towards an RIS requires greater efforts 
of articulation and coordination among the agents that make up the system, it can be achieved through strategies and policies in 
joint collaboration for the consolidation of the industry in the region. The paper enriches our understanding of RIS in the context 
of a developing region in a high-tech industry.

1. Introduction  
Mexico’s aerospace industry has registered exponential growth over the last decade. Mexican exports of aerospace 
products have grown extraordinarily since 2010, the level of exports has increased to 14% on an annual average during 
the period 2010-2016 and in 2016 it reached an amount of $ 7,164 million dollars. Between 2003 and 2015, the 
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) accumulated in the Mexican aerospace industry was of 2530.4 million dollars. 
(FEMIA-SE, 2016). Most studies about aerospace industry innovation in Mexico so far focused on the national scale, 
the region-level analysis is much needed to understand the growth and concentration of aerospace industry 
development in Mexico. The development of aerospace industry in the region of Queretaro has been maintained for 
the last 10 years, and has been consolidating as the region of Mexico that records the highest growth in terms of 
economic indicators, in the last five years the direct foreign investment accumulated in the aerospace sector of 
Queretaro amounted to 1,300 million dollars, making it the region with the highest index of FDI in the country 
(SEDESU, 2016). The region concentrates the largest number of public research centers related to R & D activities in 
the aerospace industry, which greatly contributes to the attraction of higher value-added projects and the generation 
of better paid jobs, as well as great support for part of the government of the region to boost the development of the 
industry. This research examines the growth of aerospace industry in Queretaro using the perspective of Regional 
Innovation Systems (RIS). The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section, the literature 
review (Territorial Agglomeration, Cluster and RIS) are reviewed. Second, methodology and the case are introduced. 
Third, the evolution of the aerospace industry in Queretaro in terms of socio-economic development, key agents and 
consolidation towards a RIS is discussed. Finally, the theoretical contribution of this research is provided.

To promote the sustainable human development of the inhabitants of 
the State of Querétaro, to present and future generations, through the 
rational and equitable use of natural, economic and social resources; 
thus achieving access to better living conditions.  
 
The role of government agencies is highlighted to encourage innovation processes in the region of Queretaro through 
public policies, subsidies and infrastructure, government support is essential to generate knowledge spillovers and 
strengthen the economic and social development. Table 5 shows the main intermediate organizations, as well as their 
mission, it should be noted that these organizations help to promote and develop the aerospace industry.

When analyzing the theoretical approach of the RIS in relation to the development of the aerospace industry in Queretaro, 
we note that it has the main elements to consider the region from this approach, however, its consolidation is under 
development and the relevance of the exchange of knowledge between agents is crucial, as well as support to local 
companies through government institutions to develop innovation capacities that generate greater added value and 
strengthen the industry in the region. Figure 4 shows the relationship between agents in relation to the exchange of 
knowledge to develop innovation capacities and form a RIS. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper examines the development process of the aerospace industry in Queretaro using the perspective of RIS, most 
studies about aerospace industry in Mexico have focused on the national level, the region-level analysis is much needed 
to understand the growth and concentration of aerospace industry development in Mexico. Generating and developing 
innovation capabilities requires diversity and feedback from various agents that make up a RIS. In the case of the 
Queretaro region, there is a growing generation of capabilities in the aerospace industry in the last decade, however to 
achieve the consolidation of this industry in the region, greater efforts of articulation and coordination among the agents 
that make up the system, can be achieved through strategies and policies in joint collaboration. 
 
For example, nowadays, in some very special cases, companies make agreements with educational institutions to carry 
out training programs for their employees tailored to their needs, the experience seems to indicate that these tailored 
courses are more successful than the standardized ones, at least in the case of relatively short trainings for basic 
technicians, a course to cover the common needs of the companies of the industry offered by the UNAQ (Universidad 
Nacional Aeronáutica de Querétaro) are a success for the companies because the institution has the capabilities and 
infrastructure to offer tailor-made courses for companies and are highly valued by them.

In recent years several aerospace engineering programs have been created in the region, there is still doubt about whether 
the level of teachers and investments in laboratories are going to be sufficient to guarantee the level demanded by the 
industry in the region. In order to make more efficient the development of relevant training courses and of common interest 
for the industry, it is necessary to establish mechanisms for linking academia-industry and define the main occupations 
and capacities that need to be covered to strengthen the RIS, as well as the minimum levels of training to achieve them, 
in this case it is interesting to analyze the experiences of other countries where the industry has a greater development, 
such as the cases of regions in Canada and Brazil. From the support of government agencies via public policy it is essential 
to take a more active campaign to induce foreign companies to integrate local suppliers, additionally different types of 
support to local companies to achieve the certifications and competitiveness that is requires to be integrated into the value 
chains of the aerospace industry on a global scale.

Abstract 
Cross-docking is a logistic technique that can help in cutting inventory costs while increasing the goods. The paper 
reviews literature in cross-docking regarding to operation problems and the metaheuristic methods used for solving 
those problems in order to support the future research in developing a new decision models. The result showed that 
though there are many articles of relevance with regard to either truck or dock door, there were found very few articles 
that focus on the tasks scheduling in cross-docking.  Thus, it needs to be stated that the research gap in the cross-
docking platform would need to be filled by focusing on task scheduling and including resource capacity in models 
more practical in real world problems. In addition, taking into consideration other objectives or even multiple 
objectives could be an alternative approach for future research. Furthermore, modern technology makes cross-docking 
feasible and able to develop suitable business models. Therefore to enhance cross-docking operations to be a smart 
and intelligent logistics system especially for small and medium enterprise (SME), creating adapted concepts and 
design solutions should be developed for providing a systematic management of smart operation in cross-docking and 
synchronized to the other cross-docking problems.

1. Introduction
In most manufacturing environments, it is difficult to ship directly from the manufacturer to the customer. 
Therefore, an intermediate point is necessary to connect manufacturers and customers. One type of intermediate point 
in a supply chain system is the warehouse. A traditional warehouse has four main operations: receiving, storage, order 
picking, and shipping. These warehouses are also called distribution centers in which products are processed in real 
time and moved in and out on schedule. In competitive environments, the pressure is on to make the supply chain fast 
while keeping the prices low since more accurate and timely shipment is what the customer demands. Nevertheless, 
storage and order picking are usually the costliest operations of traditional distribution centers because of the inventory 
holding costs from storing and the costs of the labor-intensive task of order picking. Thus, the logistic techniques that 
can help in cutting inventory costs while increasing the goods flow and shortening the shipping cycle are considerable 
as a cross-docking approach. Cross-dock is a specific kind of warehouse, where the received products are loaded 
immediately within 24 hours to the outbound dock door; as a result, order picking and storage activity could be

Abstract 
Maintenance, production scheduling, and quality control are the three important functions, which can improve the 
performance of a manufacturing system. In the operational context, all these shop floor activities have an interacting 
effect with each other. For example, while production scheduling; it is assumed that the machines are continuously 
available during production. However, in real manufacturing systems, machines may undergo failure and hence 
some unavailability periods such as preventive/corrective maintenance activities may exist during production. 
Similarly, preventive maintenance (PM) activities take time that could have been utilized for production purposes. 
Also, delaying the preventive maintenance or inadequate maintenance may degrade the machine condition which in 
turn may degrade the quality of the products being manufactured on the machine resulting in large amount of 
rework, rejection and scrap. Hence, there exists a strong interrelationship between production scheduling, 
maintenance and quality control. However, these shop floor activities are done mostly independent of each other.  
This paper presents a methodology for combining selective maintenance, production scheduling and quality control 
for multi machine system. The objective is to obtain the minimum cost solution for the simultaneous decision on 
maintenance, production schedule and quality control. The proposed approach results in the sequence for the batches 
on each machine, the maintenance actions for components and the quality control parameters. A simulated annealing 
algorithm is used for optimization. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.

Abstract 
While globalization and informatization progress, information networks typified by the Internet gets 
attention. Therefore, the term network is often conscious of strong linkage with information. However, a 
network is diverse and ambiguous concept that includes not only relation to information but also relation 
to people, organizations, systems, and the like. Focusing on ""network"" studies, many researchers are 
studying from both aspects of social science and natural science. The former are research fields such as 
interorganizational relations, network organization, communication network, and so on. The latter are 
research fields such as information networks, information communication networks, graph theory and 
probability theory, and so on. 
Regarding ""network"" having such diverse and ambiguous meaning, the authors are studying ""Network 
study based on the management information approach"". We are examining the diverse and ambiguous 
features of the network from both formal theory and semantics. In other words, the social scientific approach 
and the engineering approach are positioned as semantic approaches and formal approaches, respectively. 
In this report, we introduce classification criteria of network proposed by us. That is, we show the 
classification criteria of ""network - like network"" and ""network - unlike network"" according to natural 
approach, especially graph theoretical approach with respect to the meaning of the network in the research 
filed of social science. In addition, we will introduce the standardized concatenation density for quantifying 
their connectivity.

Abstract 
The Philippine education system specifically for grade school students require a high number volume of books, and 
other educational items e.g. notebooks that are required to bring every day to class. The findings of this research 
suggest that the actual and current strollers for the school children produce a lot of stress, strain and long-term 
gradual health deterioration. Stroller type was highly correlated with high level of strain, stress and decrease in 
children output productivity. Considering the preliminary findings of this study, the parents and the teachers should 
evaluate, decrease the volume of books and school materials, and if not possible, produce a more ergonomic design 
for the stroller or bag of the school children. The findings of this study recommend the need to change and 
standardize stroller bag designs using the evaluation from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
Lifting Equation.

THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND 
1.1 Introduction 
It has been widely observed that children who go to school in their early preparatory education, grades 1 to 3 that 
they are required to bring a heavy number of books as part of compulsory requirements for their education. Every 
subject of the curriculum needs about 1 to 2 textbooks for every semester that the students are enrolled in. On 
average, there are seven subjects taken by grades 1 to 3 students on various schools. In addition to these textbooks 
are notebooks paired for every subject, and other minor materials for some subjects such as journals and educational 
materials. Backpacks are not suitable for all of these materials and textbooks because of the insufficient space and 
excessive weight. The common alternative is to use a backpack and a separate carry method that is using a rope to 
tie around the books for hand carry. This not favorable because of time constraints, distracting environment and 
school children had to be nursed by the teachers or their respective guardians and caretakers. The most practical and 
convenient for both the parents and the children is the trolley bag, a high capacity sturdy bag that can cater to all the 
educational materials of the students. However, an obvious result is seen as the children suffer from body and hand 
strain, physical stress generating low productivity output and also contributes to long term health deterioration.

The table above shows the comparison between the positive and negative effects of using a backpack to carry the 
school children’s educational materials and the proposed stroller type bag design for school children. It is evident 
that there needs to be a standardization of the proper school bags to avoid injuries and indirect costs. 
 
4.6 Problem Tree Analysis 
 
Fig 4.4. Problem Tree Analysis for the currently used bags of school children 
Main problem: School children are using heavy backpacks and strollers that are not ergonomically designed. 
Causes 
Lifting of heavy loads in backpacks – School children normally and on average carry around 3 kilograms of weight 
in their backpacks, the mounting of the backpack results in spinal twist and strain, shoulder strain, and back spinal 
posture problems. 
Improper Posture due to uneven strap of backpack – the two straps of the backpack needed to be mounted at the 
same time while carrying the backpack in order to avoid the improper posture. 
 
Injuries in muscle, bones, and other affected parts – a number of children have weak bones and also frequently 
carrying heavy loads may result in injuries to the affected parts of the body. 
 
Effects 
Physical Strain – A great or excessive pressure or stress on one’s body because of the heavy loads in the backpack 
Low Back Disorder and back pain – Because of poor posture given by carrying uneven loads in the backpack, there 
occurs various issues with the low back such as Muscle Spasms which means that the body is attempting to protect a 
sore back, Disc trouble which means the jelly like material inside this disc is prone to slip or break 
Additional Cost in treating and long term health issues – The frequent usage of heavy backpacks and injury prone 
stroller builds up long term health issues such as scoliosis – a medical condition wherein the spine has a sideways 
curve, which tantamount to a great expense in healthcare over a long period.

ergonomics assessment tool was researched by determining to what extent to some of the objectives have been 
attained. 
 
5.1 Summary of Findings 
 
 
The focus of this study was to determine the faults of using backpack and trolley bag specifically for school children 
grades 1 – 3, and the computations and results of the several ergonomic tools have indicated that there is indeed a 
great discrepancy between the two comparisons for the school bag. This research used the ergonomic tools as 
assessment indicators from these objectives to establish what extent has been viable. The background of this study 
was done by examining and analyzing several relevant literatures on the case internationally and locally. The 
background of this study covers the impact and initial indicators that there is indeed a problem on school children 
backpacks and trolleys. The research approach used was qualitative, associational research approach. The research 
population was school children from grades 1 – 3, ages 7 to 11 years old.  The sampling method used in this study 
was the cluster sampling method, with population in the Plaridel Central School, in groups of the grades 1 to 3 
school children, and obtaining a sample to the several sections in their respective sections of classes.  
 
To develop a design for a Trolley School Bag of elementary children in grades 1-3 using ergonomic 
assessment tool.  
The combination of needs assessment, convenience features and ergonomic factors have paved the way to create a 
design that is appropriate to use by school children grades 1 – 3. As evidenced by the illustration provided in the 
previous chapter, the several features and dimensions are seen. 
 
To determine a significant relationship between the children’s profile and their preferences in choosing 
school bags 
School children grades 1 -3 are separated by gender, and their average measurements were taken such as arm length, 
hand grip strength and hip width. These data together with their preferences in choosing school bags were taken into 
consideration for the comparative analysis and other necessary tools for this research. 
 
To analyze how the school bag design affects the load on spinal posture during stair use by children 
The trolley bags of the school children mainly have the problem by stair use because of the heavy loads their bag has 
and that these school children pull it up the stairs on the daily basis or on their school academic days. Also, on 
backpacks, the heavy loads would put stress on their shoulders, backs and spinal column. 
 
Summarizing our study this research showed how the proponents applied the knowledge they learned in course 
ergonomics in designing a product that will maintain right posture of the students in using such material the result of 
NIOSH Hazard Evaluation Checklist state that further investigation has to be made in the working process in 
immediate action is needed to ensure the safety of the students. 
 
5.2 Conclusion 
 
It is evident by the results displayed in the computations for ergonomic assessment tools that the school children 
experience too much weight on carrying backpacks and trolley bags during their utilization of these bags. The newly 
designed trolley bag would result in a significant change and improvements for the school children because of the 
adaptations and considerations for the trolley bag. The researchers conclude that there needs to be a new design for 
school trolley bags in order to reduce risk of injury, reduce stress and strain, and ease the school children’s academic 
life. 
 
5.3 Recommendations 
 
The school children should be assessed by the doctors on a frequent basis to check their bone structure, posture, 
mental and overall physical health. Elimination of large backpacks only for children who are not able to support a 
full weight on that backpack should be done. Concentrate the market of school bags in a trolley type design 
appropriate for school children in that age range and grade range. 
 
Further research can be done on the actual application and habitual observation use of newly designed trolley type 
bags for school children. Additional research can also be conducted on the materials to be used that would benefit

Abstract 
The Philippine education system specifically for grade school students require a high number volume of books, and 
other educational items e.g. notebooks that are required to bring every day to class. The findings of this research 
suggest that the actual and current strollers for the school children produce a lot of stress, strain and long-term 
gradual health deterioration. Stroller type was highly correlated with high level of strain, stress and decrease in 
children output productivity. Considering the preliminary findings of this study, the parents and the teachers should 
evaluate, decrease the volume of books and school materials, and if not possible, produce a more ergonomic design 
for the stroller or bag of the school children. The findings of this study recommend the need to change and 
standardize stroller bag designs using the evaluation from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
Lifting Equation.

THE PROBLEM AND ITS BACKGROUND 
1.1 Introduction 
It has been widely observed that children who go to school in their early preparatory education, grades 1 to 3 that 
they are required to bring a heavy number of books as part of compulsory requirements for their education. Every 
subject of the curriculum needs about 1 to 2 textbooks for every semester that the students are enrolled in. On 
average, there are seven subjects taken by grades 1 to 3 students on various schools. In addition to these textbooks 
are notebooks paired for every subject, and other minor materials for some subjects such as journals and educational 
materials. Backpacks are not suitable for all of these materials and textbooks because of the insufficient space and 
excessive weight. The common alternative is to use a backpack and a separate carry method that is using a rope to 
tie around the books for hand carry. This not favorable because of time constraints, distracting environment and 
school children had to be nursed by the teachers or their respective guardians and caretakers. The most practical and 
convenient for both the parents and the children is the trolley bag, a high capacity sturdy bag that can cater to all the 
educational materials of the students. However, an obvious result is seen as the children suffer from body and hand 
strain, physical stress generating low productivity output and also contributes to long term health deterioration.

4.6 Problem Tree Analysis 
 
Fig 4.3. Problem Tree Analysis for the currently used bags of school children 
Main problem: School children are using heavy backpacks and strollers that are not ergonomically designed. 
Causes 
Lifting of heavy loads in backpacks – School children normally and on average carry around 3 kilograms of weight 
in their backpacks, the mounting of the backpack results in spinal twist and strain, shoulder strain, and back spinal 
posture problems. 
Improper Posture due to uneven strap of backpack – the two straps of the backpack needed to be mounted at the 
same time while carrying the backpack in order to avoid the improper posture. 
 
Injuries in muscle, bones, and other affected parts – a number of children have weak bones and also frequently 
carrying heavy loads may result in injuries to the affected parts of the body. 
 
Effects 
Physical Strain – A great or excessive pressure or stress on one’s body because of the heavy loads in the backpack 
Low Back Disorder and back pain – Because of poor posture given by carrying uneven loads in the backpack, there 
occurs various issues with the low back such as Muscle Spasms which means that the body is attempting to protect a 
sore back, Disc trouble which means the jelly like material inside this disc is prone to slip or break 
Additional Cost in treating and long term health issues – The frequent usage of heavy backpacks and injury prone 
stroller builds up long term health issues such as scoliosis – a medical condition wherein the spine has a sideways 
curve, which tantamount to a great expense in healthcare over a long period.

attained. 
 
5.1 Summary of Findings 
 
 
The focus of this study was to determine the faults of using backpack and trolley bag specifically for school children 
grades 1 – 3, and the computations and results of the several ergonomic tools have indicated that there is indeed a 
great discrepancy between the two comparisons for the school bag. This research used the ergonomic tools as 
assessment indicators from these objectives to establish what extent has been viable. The background of this study 
was done by examining and analyzing several relevant literatures on the case internationally and locally. The 
background of this study covers the impact and initial indicators that there is indeed a problem on school children 
backpacks and trolleys. The research approach used was qualitative, associational research approach. The research 
population was school children from grades 1 – 3, ages 7 to 11 years old.  The sampling method used in this study 
was the cluster sampling method, with population in the Plaridel Central School, in groups of the grades 1 to 3 
school children, and obtaining a sample to the several sections in their respective sections of classes.  
 
To develop a design for a Trolley School Bag of elementary children in grades 1-3 using ergonomic 
assessment tool.  
The combination of needs assessment, convenience features and ergonomic factors have paved the way to create a 
design that is appropriate to use by school children grades 1 – 3. As evidenced by the illustration provided in the 
previous chapter, the several features and dimensions are seen. 
 
To determine a significant relationship between the children’s profile and their preferences in choosing 
school bags 
School children grades 1 -3 are separated by gender, and their average measurements were taken such as arm length, 
hand grip strength and hip width. These data together with their preferences in choosing school bags were taken into 
consideration for the comparative analysis and other necessary tools for this research. 
 
To analyze how the school bag design affects the load on spinal posture during stair use by children 
The trolley bags of the school children mainly have the problem by stair use because of the heavy loads their bag has 
and that these school children pull it up the stairs on the daily basis or on their school academic days. Also, on 
backpacks, the heavy loads would put stress on their shoulders, backs and spinal column. 
 
Summarizing our study this research showed how the proponents applied the knowledge they learned in course 
ergonomics in designing a product that will maintain right posture of the students in using such material the result of 
NIOSH Hazard Evaluation Checklist state that further investigation has to be made in the working process in 
immediate action is needed to ensure the safety of the students.

It is evident by the results displayed in the computations for ergonomic assessment tools that the school children 
experience too much weight on carrying backpacks and trolley bags during their utilization of these bags. The newly 
designed trolley bag would result in a significant change and improvements for the school children because of the 
adaptations and considerations for the trolley bag. The researchers conclude that there needs to be a new design for 
school trolley bags in order to reduce risk of injury, reduce stress and strain, and ease the school children’s academic

Abstract 
Improvement of machine learning performance is always an important issue in machine learning 
community. Ensemble learning has been shown to be able to normally improve model performance by 
combining various algorithms in the model. Most winners of large-scale data science competitions use 
ensemble learning technique to get high scores. Given available machine learning algorithms, ensemble 
learning involves two tasks, hypothesis selection and hypothesis combination. Hypothesis selection is 
about selecting the algorithms that are beneficial to model performance into the ensemble learning model, 
while hypothesis combination is related to determine the combination coefficients of the algorithms in the 
model. This work focuses on hypothesis combination problem, and we formulate it into an optimization 
problem. We propose to use genetic algorithm (GA) to tackle this optimization problem. 
The GA is a search heuristic for the purpose of solving optimization problem, which is a part of 
evolutionary computation. GA is inspired by the theory of natural evolution, which comprises several 
components, including selection, crossover and mutation. There are five phases involved in a typical GA 
algorithm: initial population, fitness function, selection, crossover, and mutation. GA begins with an 
initial population which can be regarded as a set of solutions. Next, a fitness function has to be defined to 
determine the fitness of each individual. Once the fitness score for each individual is computed, the 
selection and crossover are used to generate the fitting offspring. For a small amount of new offspring, 
some of their genes will mutate with a low probability. The whole process will repeat until the population 
converges. 
This work follows GA process to encode the problem, and defines appropriate fitness function according 
to the characteristics of the problem. We conduct experiments to evaluate the proposed approach in 
ensemble learning on a multi-class classification dataset, Red Wine Quality. We transform this problem 
into a binary classification problem, and use ten classification algorithms in the hypothesis pool, 
including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, 
Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Nu-Support Vector Machine, Stochastic Gradient Descent 
and Nearest Centroid. To determine the combination coefficients of each model, the continuous encoding 
of chromosomes is represented as binary chromosomes of approximation, and F1 is used as the fitness 
function. We use F1 score as the evaluation metric, and compare the proposed method with several 
alternatives. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is comparative in determining the 
combination coefficients of algorithms in the ensemble learning.

Abstract 
Facility location problem is a class of combinatorial optimization problems that has been extensively studied in the 
literature. Different variants of facility location problems have been used to model a wide variety of problems 
ranging from location of servers in communication networks to warehouses in a supply chain network to location of 
emergency services such as ambulances in public service systems. While the conventional models have been 
successful in providing solution to many real life location problems, these models make the assumption that 
facilities, once located, remain functional forever. This assumption is far from reality as facilities at times become 
non-functional (or fail) due to a variety of reasons including natural calamities, union strikes, terrorist attacks etc. 
The effects of such failures have become more pronounced due to the increased dependence on facilities because of 
adoption of lean paradigm. Therefore, researchers have proposed reliable facility location models, which incorporate 
the failure prone nature of the facilities. However, the RUFLP models studied in the literature can be classified as 
Single Period RUFLP, as these models make two implicit assumptions. First, they assume that a facility, if failed, 
remains failed through out the rest of the horizon, and similarly, a facility, if functional, remains functional through 
out. Second, they also assume that all the facility failures are realized simultaneously. Both of these assumptions are 
rather restrictive and do not hold true for many real life situations. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the 
Multiperiod Reliable Uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (MRUFLP) that relaxes these assumptions by 
accounting for facility recovery after a failure, and allowing the facility failures to realize at different times in the 
planning horizon. More specifically, we present a two stage stochastic programming formulation, an extensive 
formulation and a non-linear integer programming formulation for the MRUFLP. We present a constant factor 
approximation algorithm for the problem and also present a fast heuristic to solve real life instances of the problem.

Abstract 
In recent years, many studies on principal points, which was proposed by Flury (1990), have been 
developed in the field of statistical analysis. When a probability density function is divided into several 
regions for the data for which the probability distribution is assumed, the points representing the 
respective regions are called the principal points. 
On the other hand, there are numerous data, including selection type questionnaire data and personal 
profile data, which can return binary (0 or 1) values that assume the distributions of multivariate binary 
data. In regard to this, Haruka Yamashita and Suzuki (2010) proposed principal points for the distribution 
of binary data based on the framework of the conventional principal points scheme. 
In this research, we propose a new search method by introducing a dendrogram for binary (0 or 1) type 
k-principal points (Haruka Yamashita and Hideo Suzuki; 2010). In this search method, we aggregate n 
samples into k groups using dendrograms obtained from a cluster analysis. Then, the minimum binary 
type vector is obtained for each group by finding the sum of the squares of the distances from each 
sample, and we set them as the principal points. 
  Furthermore, we classified various “line superiority organizations” using binary data and separating 
their characteristics into a few (k) typical types (principal points) whose characteristics are similar, as an 
example of an application of the proposed method. A “line superiority organization” is an organization 
scheme with members who have high levels of expertise and authority, who actually carry out duties as 
lines (Junichi Nagakura and Hiroshi Yamashita; 2002). For example, universities, hospitals, airlines, 
auditing corporations, think tanks, and others are can be considered as line superiority organizations.  
  Through this research, we describe the various characteristics of the “line superiority organizations” in 
a concise form, and we examine the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method from these results.

Abstract 
China has been became the important imported destination of longan fruit in Thailand. The trade has been proceeded 
through R3A route which started from Chiang-rai then across Lao to China. There is a problem because the logan fruit 
is perishable. Therefore, exporters must handle temperature that calls the cold chain. This paper aims to propose a 
factor that important for measures the cold chain performance for exported of Thailand’s longan fruit on the R3A 
route. The first stage is the identification of the key performance attribute (KPA) by review literature base performance 
of the supply chain and cold chain. Then, the researcher have discussed the factor affecting the performance such as 
Quality and safety, Traceability, Cost, and Responsiveness. The result from this paper shows that are 4 main-factor 
and 11 sub-factors to introduce exporter longan fruit. The factor would be calculated the weight of each KPA by using 
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology that presents the numerical example of weight like Quality and 
safety factor (0.518) is the most important of KPA follow by Cost (0.296), Responsiveness (0.136), and Traceability 
(0.049), respectively. This paper has proposed framework shows the weight that important to each KPA that can 
facilitate decision-makers in understanding the structure of cold chain performance of the longan fruit exporting 
industry.

5. Conclusion 
A cold chain is important for the export of longan fruit in Thailand, to reduce longan fruit losses, waste and meet 
consumers’ needs in quality and safety, cold chain adds value to agricultural products, maintain products’ quality, and 
extends the shelf life of products. This research aims to discuss the key performance attributes (KPA) that affect the 
efficiency of the cold chain for longan fruit exports in Thailand on the R3A route. We have considered the factor 
impact the performance cold chain for exported based on literature review of agriculture performance measurement 
supply chain. The factors were managed from frequently being used in the literature for mention the most useful factor. 
After that, we have interviewed export of longan fruit expert to consider the appropriate factor. Then, we group of the 
factor by regarding the implication of each aspect which refer to a priority of the factor based on the AHP method. 
Consequently, we have performed of decision-making criteria for weighting cold chain performance evaluation is 
separated into kinds of 4 main factors and 11 sub-factors. Subsequently, the expert has given of weighting each factor 
to pairwise comparison. For the weight presented a Quality and safety factor (0.518) is the most important of KPA 
follow by cost factor (0.296), Responsiveness (0.136), and Traceability (0.049), respectively. Therefore, the factor 
from the research can be applied to can facilitate decision-makers in understanding the structure of cold chain 
performance of the longan fruit exporting industry. In the future, this research combining with more data to see the 
actual effects should be made in each step of a research framework. We then will apply the decision criteria to a cold 
chain performance measurement for exported longan fruit industry in Thailand on the R3A route to prioritize and 
benchmarking in the same industry.

Abstract 
A colloidal mixture of nano-sized (<100 nm) particles in a base liquid called Nanofluid, which is the new generation 
of heat transfer fluid for various heat transfer applications where thermo-physical characteristics are substantially 
higher than the base liquid. In the present study, the effects due to temperature and concentration on thermo-physical 
properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity and density) for hybrid Nano fluids are discussed.The present work 
focuses on thermal conductivity and viscosity measurement of fluid mixture. This however, has not been addressed 
properly so far. It shows that thermal conductivity increases with nanoparticles concentration as well as with the 
temperature.Whereas,viscosity and density decreases with temperature and increases with nanoparticles 
concentration. Still more research is necessary to understand the mechanism behind the augmentation of heat 
transfer with hybrid nanofluids and to make use of hybrid nanofluids in real life applications.

Introduction 
In a car engine heat is produced due to the combustion and some portion of heat is utilized to produce the 
power rest of heat is wasted in the form of exhaust heat. If this excess heat is not removed, the engine temperature 
becomes too high which results in overheating and viscosity breakdown of the lubricating oil, wear of the engine 
parts, due to thermal stress of the engine components failure may occurs in engine. So that an effective cooling 
system is necessary. The car engine  utilizes a heat exchanger device, termed as radiator, in order to remove the heat 
from the cooling jacket of the engine. The radiator considered as an important component of the cooling system of 
the engine. Normally, it is used as a cooling system of the engine and generally water is the heat transfer medium 
.For this liquid-cooled system, the waste heat is removed via the circulating coolant surrounding the devices or 
entering the cooling channels in devices. The coolant is propelled by pumps and the heat is carried away mainly by 
radiator. 
Now a days, alumina is one of the most used oxides due to its use in many areas such as thin film coatings, 
heat-resistant materials, and advanced ceramic abrasive grains. Improved devices using nanoscale structures 
requires the understanding of thermal, mechanical electrical and optical properties of nanostructures involved and 
also their manufacturing process.Task is to use selective nanofluids as a coolant to enhance heat transfer rate. 
Nanofluids are a relatively new classification of fluids which consist of a base fluid with nanosized particles (1-100 
nm) suspended within them. These particles generally a metal or metal oxide, increase conduction and convection 
coefficients, allowing for more heat transfer out of the coolant. There have been several advancements recently 
which have made the nanofluids more stable and ready for use in real world applications. 
Conventional fluids, such as water, engine oil, ethylene glycol, etc. have poor heat transfer performance 
and therefore high compactness and effectiveness of heat transfer systems are necessary to achieve the required heat 
transfer. Among the efforts for enhancement of heat transfer the application of additives to liquids is more 
noticeable. Recent advances in nanotechnology have allowed development of a new category of fluids termed

Abstract 
The authors propose ""the domain transition probability model for resource circulation"" that is 
developed from ""the conceptual model for resource circulation"". The former model (conceptual model) is 
a qualitative model that describes resource circulation between the natural space and social space on Earth 
by domain transition of four areas, namely the resource domain → production domain → consumption 
domain → waste domain → resource domain → ..., macroscopically. The latter model (domain transition 
probability model) is a scheme that enables the quantitative analysis of the Earth’s environment in the 
future by introducing the domain transition probability matrix and state vector in the conceptual model. 
Given the current (t = 0) state vector and domain transition probability matrix, we can predict the state 
vectors at time t and t → ∞. 
However, when considering resource circulation on Earth, the authors designate the state wherein the 
intake, expulsion, and natural purification rates are equal as an ideal state for achieving smooth resource 
circulation. Further, the authors have conducted research on the ""three element deviation degree"" for 
quantitatively describing the deviation degrees of these three ideal and real elements. In this research, in 
consideration of the deviation degree of synchronization between production and sales in corporate 
activities, the authors propose the ""four element deviation degree,"" which synthesizes the ""three element 
deviation degree"" and ""synchronization deviation degree"". By doing this, a quantitative discussion of the 
gap between the ideal and the real in the four domain transitions, including corporate activities, can be 
conducted. In this research, simple numerical examples on the current (t = 0) state vector (initial state 
vector) and domain transition probability matrix are established. Further, the crisis situation of Earth’s 
environment in the future is implicated by analyzing the relation between these deviation degrees and the 
resource, inventory, in-use, and waste proportions.

Abstract 
Small-scale wind turbines are useful in urban areas as a source of electricity, where the main focus is towards 
producing optimum power in a limited area with a low wind velocity. Shrouding of a wind turbine with a proper shape 
is found to be an effective method to augment wind velocity. The present work aims to power one room of an average 
house in a typical tier two city in India. A duct is designed for rooftop installation by referring to the wind availability 
data for an average height of 10m. A 2-Dimensional numerical scheme is developed to optimize the shape of the duct 
using ANSYS Fluent. The SST k-w turbulence model is used to capture the velocity fluctuations. Optimized shape of 
the duct is a convergent-divergent section, with the wind turbine placed at the throat. It is found that the convergent 
section does not have a significant effect on the wind velocity at the throat, but helps in directing the path. Introducing 
divergent section increases the wind velocity and achieves an average velocity increment of 1.32, which is close to 
the designed theoretical value 1.4. Output power is obtained by selection of proper airfoil and generator. Introduction 
of vortex generator at the divergent end offers an additional 15% increase in wind velocity at the throat, which is 10% 
higher than the designed theoretical ratio.

How the difference in product characteristics affects the 
relationship with customers? ~In the case of the electronics 
parts industry increasing its focus on the automotive 
market~

Abstract 
Abstract 
The electronic parts industry of Japan is very internationally competitive. However, the types of suppliers 
can be roughly classified into two types; a specialized supplier and a generalized supplier according to the 
on-going “selection and concentration” of business operations, and each supplier has a different product 
characteristics. 
In recent years, the electronic parts industry in Japan attempts to increase its focus on the automotive 
market. While expanding auto parts transactions, it can be thought the differences in product characteristics 
in each supplier will make a difference in the relationship with customers. 
In this paper, by comparing analysis of a specialized supplier and a generalized supplier increasing their 
focus on auto parts transactions, it is clarified generalized supplier tends to maintain fixed relationships 
with customers in comparison with specialized supplier in the auto parts transaction. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
The electronic parts industry of Japan keeps international high competitiveness, market share and profitability. 
However, the types of suppliers can be roughly classified into specialized supplier and generalized supplier. The 
former maintains competitiveness by focusing resources on a special field, and the latter focuses resources on a wide 
range of parts. 
Recently, we can see that Japanese electronic parts industry is increasing its focus on the automotive market rather 
than consumer market. As shown in Figure 1, percentage of electronics parts to the value of shipments of auto parts 
is increasing, and its proportion is over 30% since 2012. Figure 2 shows comparisons of amounts of auto parts sales 
for the year 2012 with those of 2016. For example, the sales of Nidec in 2016 were about 261 billion yen, which is 
over three times the amount in 2012.Considering the fact, Japanese electronic parts industry is much more likely to 
shift their business to automotive market rather than consumer market that is shrinking to stabilize profitability. 
The automotive industry has a design concept of integral architecture. Therefore, custom designed parts or special 
order parts are mainly used for assembling an auto car, and standard parts are rarely used (Fujimoto, Ku, Konno 
2006, p.68). Originally electronic parts suppliers mainly develop standard parts for consumer market, however 
enhancement of sales for the automotive market makes them to develop parts depending on customer’s request. This 
means they are required for parts transactions which are different from those for consumer market.

4. Discussion 
 
The fact that generalized supplier develops parts including module parts (composite parts) against specialized 
supplier mainly develops a single part seems to make a difference to the relationship with customers and come out 
clearly in the transaction of auto parts. This is discussed in detail. 
Company A cannot develop module parts because their technology field is narrow, nor is engaged in the advanced 
development phase due to the nature of the product. In that sense, the opportunity for creating value added is limited, 
however they have to develop customized auto parts. Meanwhile, since auto makers have no deep knowledge about 
parts technology, it is possible for them to take technical initiative in the range of their own products, secure intellectual 
property and take the position easy to divert designed parts to other customers.  
 
On the other hand, company B has comprehensive technological capabilities, therefore they are required for 
composite parts and possible to develop according to customer requests. There is an opportunity to create added value 
for customers. However, as composite parts are special order parts developed by auto maker’s initiative even though 
designed based on “Approved Drawing”, the intellectual property is on customer side. Therefore, in order to create 
added value, company B has to be engaged in the advanced development phase and deepen the business relationship 
with a specific customer. At the same time, they convert own product to other customers with modularizing inside of 
the parts and commonalizing parts as possible as they can. 
  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
For electronic parts suppliers, increasing its focus on auto parts means the basic product design concepts are made 
""integral"" or ""modular"", and the proportion of integral type is increased. In particular, it means the parts become to be 
compounded for a generalized supplier.  
Particularly in the development of composite parts for automotive market, as suppliers are required for engaging in 
the advanced development and coordinating for each customer, investment in R&D must become a relationship 
specific investment, and suppliers can only recover development expenses from a transaction relationship with a 
specific customer.  For that reason, there are some aspects that suppliers need to deepen relationships with current 
customers and improve their appraisal. 
  
On the other hand, a specialized supplier is considered to make efforts such as modularizing the inside of the 
composite parts, expediting common use of composite parts and diversifying them to other customers. In this way, 
electronic parts suppliers are required not only to build capabilities and secure profits in transactions with current 
makers, but also to emphasize the possibility of diversion to other customers.  
Although this research has analyzed two suppliers, it is necessary to implement some case studies and consider 
whether the results are adaptable to other suppliers. These aspects would be the object of future studies

Abstract 
E-learning and other online-based learning media innovations were introduced to improve the quality of education.
The main aim of this study is to measure e-learning readiness from the point of view of students at a university in
Karawang Indonesia. The questionnaire was used to determine the extent where e-learning readiness of first-year to
fourth year students. The study was conducted in the condition of the absence of the e-learning methods
applications. A measurement model of e-learning readiness presented by Aydin and Tasci is used to measure people
readiness, self-development readiness, technology readiness, and innovation readiness. It was found that, the four
proposed factors indicate in the ready category, but requires a slight increase in several factors. Based on the ELR
readiness analysis method, two of the four aspects have high ELR scores are self-development and technological
aspects. While aspects that have low ELR scores are people and innovation aspects. Therefore, both aspects require
more serious improvements so that the e-learning method is ready and can be continued.

1. Introduction
Within the literature of learning and teaching, the term “e-Learning” is often used interchangeably with other
terms such as “online learning” and “distance learning” (Aldiab, et al. 2016). Clark and Mayer in Aldiab (2016) 
define e-learning as “Instruction delivered on a digital device (such as a desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet, 
or smartphone) that is intended to support learning”. On the other hand, Oztekin (2013), e-learning means electronic 
learning that utilizes electronic communication for teaching and learning designed to be applied from a distance. 
Thus, e-learning is an electronic learning using a variety of digital communication devices that can be used to 
conduct teaching and remote communication. Som Naidu (2006) and Aydin and Tasci (2005), revealed that 
increasing attention to e-learning is directly related to increasing access against information and communication 
technology and decreasing operational costs. Information and communication technology that were supported by 
multimedia based learning and teaching is also one of the factors that support the growth of e-learning. To date, 
several studies have reported various benefit of the e-learning application. One of them is e-learning can combine 
individual and group learning activities either online or offline at the same or different times. Moreover, e-learning 
can also help the learning process to be more fun and interactive.  
E-learning has been widely used in higher education (Martínez-Torres, et al. 2011). E-learning can be used for a
distance learning and it is possible to develop in its application. Increasing the work efficiency of teacher utilizing 
information and communication technology to achieve a better learning outcome is one of the factors that affects the 
development of e-learning. The students also began to hope that their lectures were supported by web-based 
materials and technology so that could be accessed anytime and anywhere online (Naidu 2006). 
Karawang, one of the districts in Indonesia, is one of the largest industrial centers in Asia. There are universities 
that have considerable potential in Karawang because they are in the industrial center. Although many studies have 
revealed the e-learning benefits in the learning process, these universities have not applied e-learning perfectly. 
Some previous studies revealed that there are several factors that affect the use of e-learning at universities. Popovici 
and Mironov (2015) revealed that one of the factors is the technology readiness factor. Moreover, Aydin and Tasci 
(2005) revealed that e-learning strategies require considerable up-front analysis, development time, money, 
technological infrastructure, and leadership support to successful.

3. Conclusions 
Overall, the level of readiness for the implementation of e-learning based on ELR Aydin & Tasci's readiness 
analysis method is included in the ""ready"" category in the implementation of e-learning, but requires a slight 
increase in several factors (MX=3.77 > MELR=3.41). The four proposed factors indicate in the ready category, but 
requires a slight increase in several factors. Based on the ELR readiness analysis method, two of the four aspects 
have high ELR scores, there are self-development and technological aspects. While aspects that have low ELR 
scores are people and innovation aspects. Therefore, both aspects require more serious improvements so that the e-
learning method is ready and can be continued. Although readiness measurement is very important, this study only 
uses four aspects in measurement, there are people, self-development, technology, and innovation. There are still 
many readiness factors that need to be considered. Chapnick (Chapnick 2002) revealed that the readiness factor was 
represented by eight factors. Therefore, further research might explore more factors in e-learning readiness factors.

Abstract 
This paper studies the decisions of two competing firms with the risk-averse behaviors when enhancing 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). As a benchmark of two firms without investing CSR, we focus on 
the other case, that is, one of them invests in CSR. A Nash game together with the conditional value at 
risk (CVaR) to evaluate the risk-averse behavior is built to model the decisions and the optimal 
equilibrium solutions are compared under the two cases. We find that once the firm invests CSR, his price 
will be increased no matter how much his risk-averse degree is. Further, we obtain the conditions under 
which the firm will select to invest in CSR when he has risk-averse behavior and some important 
parameters, such as the cost and the demand elasticity, will strongly influence the selection of the firm’s 
green investment.

Abstract 
The American healthcare system has become a subject of an intensive debate by many global health care 
professionals who argue to some extents that the US spends more than any other similar countries on health care, yet 
the health outcomes have been hovering at the bottom for industrialized nations (Bradley-Springer, 2012). 
Researchers in the health care have been arguing that investment in the health care system alone cannot improve 
health outcomes (Butler et al. 2017). Financial pressure forces decision makers to look for a short term solution 
leading toward higher usage of drugs in U.S. than in other countries (Kwon et al. 2017).   
The main purpose of this study is to investigate the roles that economic agents and social determinants such as 
insurance coverage, income inequality measured by Gini Index. Previous studies on social determinants in health 
speculate that social determinants play more significant roles than medical spending in determining the health 
outcomes. But their studies limit their scope of study to the US only (Bradley-Springer, 2012) or advanced 
industrialized countries (Kwon et al. 2017). This study proposes to investigate statistically the relationship between 
social determinants and health outcomes for 2 economically and politically different groups of country.

Abstract 
In recent times, there is a rising interest among firms to invest in the ‘environmental-friendly promotion’ of their eco-
friendly products. Promotions of Patagonia, Diesel Clothing, and so on demonstrate this phenomenon. A group of 
experts believes that environmental-friendly facilitates a firm to achieve better profitability compared to that under 
conventional promotion. On the contrary, there exists a sceptical attitude toward the effectiveness of environmental-
friendly promotion. Our exploration of existing articles indicates that there is an absence of analytical works focussing 
on the effect of environmental-friendly promotion on a firm’s pricing decision and profitability. Here, we propose a 
Hoteling model-based methodology to design a firm’s pricing strategy under conventional promotion, environmental-
friendly promotion, consumer’s green sensitiveness, and product differentiation in a duopoly market considering both 
competition and collaboration among the firms. Under different scenarios, we determine optimal equilibrium 
promotion intensity, price, and profit. We perform a rigorous numerical analysis to facilitate the graphical depiction 
of the insights. We also demonstrate the impact of product differentiation, consumer’s green sensitiveness, and cost 
of promotion on the decision variables. Finally, we propose a framework to facilitate managerial decision making to 
select the appropriate promotion strategy.

automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) called Multiple Aisles AS/RS (MA-AS/RS). In such configuration 
of discrete events system (DES) only one Storage/Retrieval machine (crane) is used for storage and retrieval 
operations, which has the advantage of decreasing the initial system costs (space and money) but at the same time has 
the disadvantage of reducing the system throughput. This important performances assessment parameter has 
significant repercussions on the whole system performances particularly in terms of efficiency and productivity. 
We consider that the crane works under random policies i.e. bins are randomly situated for each operation and various 
functioning modes i.e. single command, double command and multiple command cycle. Thus, our approach is based 
on the calculation of the system throughput for each functioning mode using a strong and formal discrete modeling 
tool i.e. Timed Petri Nets (TPN).

1.Introduction
Manufacturing and distribution systems are devoted to producing quality products and their delivery to customers in 
the best manner i.e. most economical and timely way. One of the most important goals is to optimize all the system’s 
costs i.e. initial investments and functioning costs. For both, there are some activities, like storage, that could, 
uselessly, increase these costs. Indeed, the storage of raw materials, tools, work in process and finished product costs 
time, money and space without adding any value to stored items. 
The Material Handling Institute (MHI) defines five characteristics of an automated factory or distribution center: data 
automation, networking controls for connected equipment, production automation, flexibility and automated material 
handling. An automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS) can be categorized into both production automation, 
and of course, automated material handling. 
Investing in AS/RS has significant costs. Therefore, their conception needs to consider many physical design 
(dimensions, components, ...) and control (configuration, times, …) issues in order to use them in an optimal way and 
to fully benefit of their advantages (details on designing decisions can be found in (Roodbergen and Iris, 2009). AS/RS 
are rather expensive and inflexible in future changes (Lerher et al, 2006). The choice of S/R machines number is 
closely depending on the throughput capacity. For a high capacity a single machine into the single picking aisle is 
recommended. For low capacity, double deep AS/RS can be used (Lerher et al, 2006). 
Several configurations of AS/RS were developed and used years ago. They are widely used by companies to manage 
items. Till now, they evolve in consideration of different parameters: permanent need of space for storage, variety in 
size and kind of stored products, major need of optimizing storage costs (time, space, money, scheduling), cost-
effective utilization of equipment. These AS/RS are a combination of equipment and controls which automatically

4.Conclusion 
In this work we have made a performances assessment for a type of AS/RS called Multi-Aisle AS/RS. We used Timed 
Petri Nets as work tool to make a modeling of average cycle time for three functioning modes of the crane to deduce 
the aimed parameter of this performances evaluation i.e. the throughput rate. Under randomly situated bins condition, 
we presented possible scenarios of the crane moving in the system and showed how we procced for the deduction of 
this rate by the calculation of each scenario’s cycle time according to its mode. We obtained very simple formulas 
thanks to the proven formalism and robustness of TPNs. Such evaluation could help a lot for the design of such 
systems.

Abstract 
This paper outlines a comparative study between the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and the 
ASEAN Credit Transfer System (ACTS). In 2015, ASEAN member countries will form the ASEAN Economic 
Community (AEC), a region promoting economic integration and the subsequent free flow of people, trade and culture. 
The AEC will have significant impacts on higher education across the ASEAN region, and this research investigates 
how knowledge management techniques can be utilized to respond effectively to the forthcoming ACTS. The ACTS 
is a tool created to enhance and facilitate credit transfer allocation between members of the ASEAN University 
Network (AUN) and will present particular challenges for Thailand’s university administration and management. The 
paper presents a case study from Thailand, and leverages Common Knowledge Acquisition and Documentation 
Structuring (CommonKADS) to capture appropriate knowledge from Europe, where a successful Europe-wide credit 
transfer system already exists. The paper undertakes a comparative study between the ECTS and the proposed ACTS. 
The case study is based within the Faculties of Law, at Chiang Mai University (CMU), Thailand, and University 
Lumière Lyon 2, France. In Thailand, a requirement exists to prepare and provide a new framework to ensure its 
Credit Transfer System (CTS) procedure correlates with the needs of the ASEAN University Network CTS (AUN-
CTS). The AUN-CTS is a particular aspect of the AUN, which members must adhere to. This research therefore 
studies the importance and usefulness of the ECTS in comparison to the ACTS and more importantly, captures existing 
and relevant knowledge from the ECTS to raise awareness and enhance the credit transfer procedure of the CMU law 
faculty. Results show that utilizing knowledge to create a successful credit transfer allocation will facilitate increased 
student and faculty exchange, including training programs and worker mobility.

1. Introduction
A credit transfer system is an important facilitate instrument for academic exchange programs. A successful 
ASEAN credit transfer allocation will facilitate students’ mobility within ASEAN universities. In 2010, there was no 
such a reliable international credit transfer system at Chiang Mai University (CMU). The CMU was not familiar with 
any cooperation of undergraduate student international exchange program. Although, the AEC 2015 was effective 
implemented in December 31, 2015. Up until 2016, the Faculty of Law, Chiang Mai University sought to acquire a 
quality assurance ASEAN Credit Transfer Model to accommodate its undergraduate students’ international mobility, 
especially intra ASEAN University Network. In order to have a prompt and credential of grade and a number of credits 
transfer from host country to home country, a study of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) was initiated. 
The ECTS is a successful European Credit Transfer System, globally. In this study, a knowledge management 
approach was proposed and suggested by using a CommonKADS technique. This research leverages its fundamental

5. Discussion & Conclusion 
 
In this study, the 2 groups of expert interview from CMU and University Lumiere’ Lyon 2 were performed 
with the ECTS model was examined. A CommonKADS technique is applied to capture appropriate knowledge from 
Europe. The case study is based within the Faculties of Law, at Chiang Mai University, Thailand, and University 
Lumiere Lyon2, France. This research therefore studies the importance and usefulness of the ECTS in comparison to 
the ACTS. As of 2016, there is no AUN credit transfer system in CMU and ASEAN University Network.  In this 
research, a model of ASEAN University Network Credit Transfer System was created. It provides a process for student 
and faculty academic exchange through the University Notification Rules and Regulations. There are 3 types of 
ACTS-CMU credit transfer: Type I Direct Credit Transfer, Type II Transformation Credit Transfer and Type III 
Auditing. The AUN-CTS is a particular aspect of the AUN, which members must adhere to. Results show that utilizing 
knowledge to create a successful credit transfer allocation will facilitate increased student and faculty exchange, 
including training programs and worker mobility.

Abstract 
While the growth percentage of automobiles in India is at 11% CAGR in last 10 years, the auto OEMs struggle to 
cope up with the increasing service demand especially for the newer vehicles. There has been a declining trend for 
the older vehicles to visit authorized service repairers. With the advancement of vehicle technology, the services by 
unorganized workshops become more and more difficult due to lack of skill and knowledge to handle the modern 
technology in the vehicle design. 
This study is made on passenger vehicle industry in India which is witnessing a CAGR of 9.7% in 15 years with 
presence of almost all major MNCs besides the strong domestic players. The service channel in PV segment is 
divided into three categories – (a) OEM authorized Service Centres (b) Multi-brand Outlets (MBO) and (c) 
Independent Garages (IG). According to estimate in the industry, the share of OEM ASC is 49% of the total service 
market and the IG caters to 50%. According to Bhattacharjee et al. (2013), the total service market size is INR 280 
billion. It is gathered from the industry that the number of car service workshops under IG category in India is 
around 75000 vis-à-vis 7000 of OEM ASC and 2000 of MBO. The number itself speaks the size and diversity of 
business through IGs. 
This necessitates the auto OEMs or major professional groups to come forward in developing a supply chain model 
to use the vast network of IGs in the unorganized sector to give them an organized platform for the benefit of 
customers by providing a sustainable value chain.  
A collaborative supply chain model has been worked out between an OEM giant and a Lubricant major in India to 
upgrade the IG sector and also garner business. The OEM has the expertise in servicing and sourcing genuine spares 
for all makes and models of vehicles and the Lubricant company is willing to offer financial support to IG for 
upgradation of facilities and for equipment against contracted quantity of lubricant purchase within a specified time. 
The following matrix will make the model very clear in terms of the roles of collaborating partners..

The OEM will position the spares through a hub and spoke model based on the demand placed by the IG through the 
CRM platform provided by the OEM. The skill and knowledge developed for IG will be at a centralized training 
centre. The lubricants will be supplied through the supply chain of the Lubricant company and nurturing of the 
business of IG will also be overseen by the supply chain partner of the company. 
Hence the described model gives a win-win situation for all the stakeholders – OEM partner, lubricant partner, IG 
and the customers.

Abstract (12 font) 
A case study was conducted to propose a redesign of a workplace of Visually Impaired and Blind Massage 
Therapists, sponsored by a franchise of this service. The researchers gathered previous studies to set 
standards to the workplace and then surveyed the workplace setting, interviewed the operations manager, 
used an Ergonomic Workstation Checklist and the OSHA Ergonomic Assessment Checklist. It was found 
out that the highest risks of the workplace was the height of the massage table, and the small workspace 
resulting in habitual absences of the therapists. In order to avoid that, it is highly recommended to change 
their massage tables into adjustable heights, elongate both the length and width, and expand the massage 
therapy room in order for the therapists to move comfortably.

Abstract 
Over past decade the human activity has been affected toward environmental. The economic and industry 
expansion are the main factor which lead to the consequently effect consist. The decline of urban environment in many 
cities and they are all facing challenges of unsustainable development. As huge energy consumers and pollutant 
emitters, cities should play a key role in controlling the world GHG emissions. In Yasothon municipality, there are 
highly consuming of papaya but no found of the city farming lead to the highly import of products. Those are the 
cause of unsustainability and global warming. This research evaluated the city carbon footprint through papaya supply 
chain and developed green supply chain and logistic model, which is the modern practices for reduce the 
environmental externalities. The empirical model adopts green vehicle routing problem which establish by GIS 
software. Our findings suggest optimizing quantity of import product and in-city manufacture. In addition, the

Abstract 
The objective of the research is to develop a conceptual framework for the adoption of Green Manufacturing (GM) 
by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia. This study used the extended Technology, Organizational 
and Environmental framework (TOE) and institutional theory to analyze the factors that influence GM’s adoption by 
SMEs and the effect this has on their financial and environmental performance. This paper examines four variables, 
three factors (TOE) plus the characteristics of managers. In a SME, the manager/owner is the key person, as the actor 
who makes various decisions. In previous studies, the construct of the characteristics of managers tended to focus on 
cognitive and contextual problems. This paper observes that emotional problems, which are related to the spiritual 
aspects of managers, are important things that are widely investigated in individual ecological behavior.  Spiritual 
aspects have not been widely studied in the construct of a manager's characteristics, whereas in the realm of 
psychology, this aspect influences their behavior related to the environment. This paper contributes by considering 
the spiritual factors in the characteristics of managers. A quantitative research technique using the survey method will 
be applied for the research.

I. Introduction
Garbage and pollution are one of the environmental problems that threaten human life (Leonidou and Leonidou 2011). 
Public awareness of environmental problems is increasing, making companies adopt ecological issues in their 
activities (Anderberg et al. 2010). One of the innovations taken by companies to respond to environmental problems 
is Green Manufacturing (GM). GM differs from traditional manufacturing, as it includes a variety of things during the 
production process that are concerned with the companies’ environmental impacts (Rehman et al. 2014). GM is a 
manufacturing method that minimizes pollution and waste (Chuang and Yang 2014). The approach of GM includes 
the design of the product and engineering activities to minimize the environmental impact (Deif 2011). 
Literature studies on GM’s bibliometrics indicate that this topic showed significant developments in 2010 
(Setyaningsih et al. 2018). Research into GM’s adoption has been focused on large companies (Aykol and Leonidou 
2015), with only a limited focus on small businesses (Setyaningsihet al. 2018). Small companies are considered to 
have a lower environmental impact, so that their activities in relation to the environment receive less attention from 
stakeholders (Tilley 1999). SMEs also have less financial, labor, and technical facilities to start and implement 
environmental management activities (Tilley 1999). These constraints are considered to be a barrier to SMEs adopting 
GM (Revell et al. 2010).

Abstract 
The demand for aviation has been growing at an ever increasing rate. As a result there is an increasing pressure on
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
airlines to operate more flights to cater to this demand. The key bottleneck in this process is the airport capacity.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Airports, depending on their layout and size, have a stipulated capacity in terms of the number of aircraft they can
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
handle in an hour. Increasing this capacity often involves creating new taxiways or increasing the number of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
runways which is capital intensive. The construction work might require a part of the airport to be shut down
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
resulting in losses which adds on to the cost. Hence airports have a high inertia to increase capacity. 
At most major international airports it is observed that operational capacity is much lower than that of the actual
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
airport capacity. The operational capacity can be as low as 83% of the actual capacity at some airports. This gap
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
suggests that there is huge potential to increase the number of aircraft handled by an airport without increasing its

demand, arrival throughput and weather conditions. The departure demand and the arrival throughput are given as

containing multiple runways. Another feature of our model is that it provides a comprehensive estimate which

Abstract 
The logistics industry is a major support to the Indian economy as it contributes a lot to the GDP. The entire country 
depends upon logistics for all its needs, right from basic food supply to big manufacturing machinery. The logistics 
cost in India is higher than in many countries. One of the main reason behind this is that there are too many taxes 
such as excise duty, service tax, sales tax/VAT/CST, customs duty and entry /entertainment tax, etc. and numerous 
intra-state taxes which makes domestic production unfavorable option for manufacturers. In addition to this, any 
shipment that moves in different Indian states was taxed multiple times as per various geographical locations. To 
overcome all these issues, the Government of India introduced a single common tax, known as Goods and Service 
Tax (GST). GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. 
The GST is pegged to transform India into a single integrated market. The warehousing sector would be both an 
enabler and beneficiary of India’s biggest tax reform. Any positive changes in the warehousing and logistics will 
boost the global competitiveness of the country. The central region has the advantage to become the warehousing 
hub of the country because of its geographical location, proper road and railway networks that run both lengthwise 
and breadthwise, connecting the major metropolises due to the implementation of GST. This paper presents the 
system thinking view on the impact of GST on the warehousing sector from the location aspect. Systems thinking 
approach is applied and a causal loop diagram is developed by considering various issues and important variables to 
show how the implementation of single common tax has affected the warehousing sector. With the implementation 
of GST, the central region of India will have an upper hand as compared to other parts of the country from the 
warehousing point of view. The major variables that we have considered while making the causal loop diagram are 
cost uniformity, inventory management, logistical costs, operational efficiency, and many more. An example of the 
warehousing industry is presented to clear the system thinking view. The proposed system thinking will help for the 
further development of system dynamics model on the major decisions related to logistics and several other factors 
that affect the supply chain of warehousing industries.

Abstract 
The beer foam is one of the first elements that the consumer judges to determine the quality of a beer, so it is very 
important to the brewer as well. However, at the time of drinking, it is common to observe that the consumer 
discards foam, wasting an important percentage of the nutrients. This project presents a research on the nutritional 
content of beer foam through various laboratory tests, as well as proposals to make the foam more attractive to the 
consumer so that beer can be fully used, serving equally to divulge the benefits of beer. Through the tests, which are 
explained in detail in the document, the content of proteins, phenols, phosphates, vitamins, carbohydrates and 
minerals (which include potassium, phosphorus, calcium, silicon and magnesium) in the foam of a specific beer 
brand. In addition, the benefits of responsible beer consumption are described, which mainly are its diuretic effect 
(thanks to its potassium content), its ability to be metabolized, its vasodilator capacity and its antioxidant content. To 
know the consumption habits of beer foam, a survey was carried out, which helped to generate ideas for a better use 
of the beverage, by adding other nutrients and improving its quality.

1. Introduction
Beer is one of the oldest and most consumed alcoholic beverages in the world. Previous studies determined that 
several characteristics of beer such as taste, foam stability, foam formation and texture are related to the raw 
materials used (Asano et al., 1982). Among these traits, the stability of beer foam is a major concern of the brewer. 
The stability of the fine beer foam has been related to the consumer's visual preferences and thus to the quality of the 
beer (Bamforth 1985). 
Foams can be defined as colloidal dispersions of gas within a continuous liquid phase at high fractions of gas 
volume. The generation of a foam results in a high increase in surface area and requires an input of energy in the 
system to overcome the force that counteracts the surface tension of the liquid bulk phase. This is achieved by 
mechanical work in the form of induced turbulence or spraying of the gas phase in the bulk liquid. Foaming 
increases the Gibbs free energy of the system. All the foams are therefore thermodynamically unstable and the initial 
state of the energy is restored by collapse of the foam. The thermodynamic instability can be partially improved by 
several physical and compositional factors (Dale, 1999). 
The foam of the beer is unique compared to other characteristics of beer quality (clarity, color, taste and aroma) the 
foam is generated from the liquid immediately before consumption, and is extensively related to the stabilized 
protein system, in the which the main stabilization material of the foam is in the form of polypeptide material 
derived from the solubilization and proteolytic degradation of cereal proteins during malting and brewing processes 
(Dale, 1999). 
The positively ionized proteins of the foam are polypeptides whose levels are predictive of the quality of the foam. 
This function can be mediated by the direct involvement in the structure of the foam and / or the indirect action that 
improves the quality of the foam (Evans et al., 1999). 
There are many components that determine the quality of beer foam, including proteins, acids, polysaccharides and 
metal ions such as iron (Bamforth, 2004).

4. Conclusion 
 
In this work an investigation was carried out through a characterization of both the liquid and the foam of the beer. 
Normally it has been attributed to beer various health benefits derived from the content of phenols, responsible for 
improving the cardiovascular system of our body. However, which relation exists in the phenolic content between 
the liquid that we ingest from the beer against the foam that we usually throw for reasons of taste, aroma and 
ignorance of the diversity of benefits contained in it. The innovation in this work is to characterize the beer foam to 
determine its real benefits and promote its intake according to its potential benefits in consumption. It has been 
proved that the phenolic content in beer foam is actually greater than the phenolic content in the liquid. It has also 
been observed in this work that when the foam returns to its liquid state, the phenolic content does not decrease, 
which means, that it is not a reversible process. It can be determined and affirmed that effectively the consumption 
of beer foam provides greater benefits than the liquid itself.

Abstract 
Order picking is the most labor-intensive and costly operation in warehouse. Efficient storage assignment rules 
enormously affect the order picking efficiency. Warehouse managers are concerned about searching for the most 
effective way of managing order picking, minimizing the costs involved in terms of travel distance. The purpose of 
this research is to develop an efficient dedicated storage allocation method utilizing both the principle of group 
technology (GT) and the cube-per-order index (COI) storage policy in a maintenance environment warehouse. In 
this method, spare parts required for a particular maintenance work are grouped together on the basis of similarity of 
usages, even if they are dissimilar in size, shape etc. After that, the groups and parts within each group are assigned 
according to COI rule. The performance of the method is evaluated using simulation and compared with other 
sequence, frequency and group based dedicated storage methods. A genetic algorithm is embedded into the 
simulation program to determine the optimal traveling sequence that will minimize the travel distance. In the 
simulation study, it is found that the proposed method has the highest reduction in the distance travelled by the 
pickers.

1. Introduction
Warehouse is an important part of any supply chain. The primary roles of a warehouse includes buffering of material 
flow to accommodate variability caused by product seasonality, consolidation of products from different suppliers 
for joined delivery to customers, and value-added-processing such as packaging, labeling, and product 
customization (Gu et al. 2007). All the problems that arises in the warehouse are categorized into two main groups: 
the design problem and the operational problem. The design problem is concerned about the issues such as the 
whole structure, dimension and sizing, layout of the departments, selection of equipment, and strategy of operation 
of the warehouse. On the other hand, the operational problem deals with receiving, delivering, storing and picking 
orders. Receiving and shipping are the inferences of a warehouse for incoming and outgoing material flow.  
Order picking is an operation that refers to the retrieving of items from storage locations in response to specific 
orders of customers. Order picking has been practiced as the most labor-intensive and expensive operation of most 
warehouses from long ago. Bartholdi and Hackman (2011) assessed the picking operations cost 55% of the total 
operating cost of a warehouse roughly. Illogical execution of order picking can cause inadequate service and high 
operating cost for the warehouse. For these reasons, order picking has become an intent area to warehousing experts 
for improving efficiency in warehouses. The order picking efficiency could be enhanced by reducing the total

5. Conclusions and scopes for future research 
 
Warehouse managers are concerned about searching for the most effective way of managing order picking, 
minimizing the costs involved in terms of travel distance. For maintenance environment warehouse, it is possible to 
group spare parts according to the type of maintenance works. The group with the lowest COI ratio can be kept 
closest to the I\O point. Moreover, the parts of a group can be arranged according to their usage frequency. In the 
simulation study, it is found that the proposed method has the highest reduction in the distance travelled by the 
picking device in the warehouse compared to the other storage methods. So, the proposed storage method can be 
applied to any production warehouse where the order structures are limited. On the other hand, the storage method 
will be easy to implement and simple to understand by a warehouse manager when it is adopted. 
 
For this research, we consider a single-sided storage rack only. Therefore, the developed storage allocation model 
can be extended for multi rack warehouse system and figuring out the effects on the order picking efficiency. It is 
also suggested to considering different warehouse layout and incorporating more realistic issues that would be very 
interesting but challenging problem.

Abstract 
On time delivery with quality and quantity is important for any manufacturing industry, especially in garment 
sectors. At present, in RMG industries, lead time is decreasing day by day and customer requirements also 
continuously changing. The primary objective of this study is to identify the defects in sewing sections that 
hinders the overall productivity of garments industry in Bangladesh and find out the ways how to reduce those 
defects in sewing line by implementing Just-in-Time (JIT) techniques. Three different product lines (Jacket, Polo 
shirt, and T-shirt) have been considered to implement this study. The sample respondents were selected from a 
reputed textile industry in Bangladesh. Purposive sampling technique is followed by data collection from sewing 
section and indication of major problems. After indication, improvement proposal is given to the industry from 
which the productivity as well as line efficiency has compared before and after applying the techniques. The 
output of the study includes the production capacity, line target, line efficiency, line performance of the respective 
sewing section that has been increased far well than before within the time duration of three months. It is also 
suggested that, different techniques like process integration, job sharing, multitasking etc. can also be 
implemented if responsible authorities of garments industry try to improve the current state situation.

1. Introduction
As the labor wage is increasing in developing countries, the apparel manufacturing has been migrating from the 
high wage developed country to low wage developing countries. Even the labor cost is cheaper than in developed 
countries due to the specific market nature of the garment industries. For example, the short production of life 
cycle, high volatility, low predictability, high level of impulse purchase, the quick market response: garment 
industries are facing the greatest challenges these days (Lucy Daly and Towers, 2004). 
Nowadays industries are getting more volumes (orders), but number of styles they have to handle has increased 
drastically. In recent day, due to small order quantities and complex designs, the garments industry has to produce 
multiple styles even within a day; this needs higher flexibility in volume and style change over.

Figure 4.4: Line efficiency before and after JIT implementation. 
5. Conclusion 
 
 
The standard minute value (SMV) is a visualization tool and its goal is to identify, demonstrate and elimination of 
waste in the process. Before eliminating waste, we must be able to see it. SMV can serve as a starting point to 
help management, engineers, production associates, schedulers, suppliers, and customers, recognize waste and 
identify its causes. Before implementation of tools & techniques of JIT training were provided to the people 
specially supervisor and make them knowledgeable about different types of waste and how to identify waste also 
reduce waste. Operator also trained on kaizen how small change make work simple and improve visibility of off-
standards and they were introduced to changing for better. 
In current state assessment it was found that Production Capacity per shift (in pcs) is 1168, line efficiency 61.22% 
which shows huge opportunities for improvement in those areas. It has started with 5 pieces bundling system in 
sewing section and then following up the line regularly and capacity study from time to time. After 
implementation of team work, process integration, job sharing, multi machine operating and balancing the task, 
eliminating unnecessary activities, team has achieved 61.33%-line efficiency, Production capacity per shift (in 
pcs) 1280. Besides defects, WIP, transportation also reduced than previous traditional systems. 
The study was done with a limited scope as there were limited time and restriction of permission from industrial 
authority during research work .As industry always go for profit, desired production line allocation were also quite 
difficult for collecting data. Future work may include super market pull between cuttings and sewing section .Also 
implementation of SMV and Kanban system to keep WIP at minimum level. The future work may include helper 
less zero defect line where each operator will be the quality at the source and creation of standard operating 
procedure (SOP) for each sections and for incentive policy also.

Abstract 
TCSC employs fast switching ability of power electronic devices and is able to control power flow on 
transmission lines during various alarming stages. The aim of this work is to integrate TCSC into 500 KV 
Hubco-Jamshoro transmission line to investigate the operational benefits. A simulation model is developed 
under MATLAB/Simulink and many simulation studies are performed to verify the feasibility of the 
proposed model for transmission line. The core essence of this work is to improve the power transmission 
capabilities of 500kV transmission line by employing TCSC switching schemes, which helps to compensate 
the power flows when installed in transmission line and thereby increases the transmission line loadability.

Introduction
Transmission networks play a key role in the structure of electrical power system of any country. 
Pakistan, in recent years, has faced not only an acute power crisis but its consumers also suffer 
from power quality issues particularly voltage and frequency instability (Rauf et al. 2015), (Nayyer 
et al. 2014), (Sahito et al. 2015) and (Rehman et al. 2016). Due to this power deficit, electricity 
remains off for 16-18 hours in rural areas while consumers in urban areas are facing 10–12 hours 
load shedding (Farooq and Shakoor 2013), (Rafique and Rehman 2017).The main power sources 
of Pakistan are located in north and south whereas the load centers are located in center. Due to

The results for 72% compensation in inductive as well as capacitive mode are shown in Figure 15. 
During this simulation, the firing angles were chosen to be from 130 to 160 degrees with increment 
of 10 degree in each step for capacitive mode.

This research discusses the power transfer from Hub to Jamshoro through Jamshoro to Hub 
transmission line. The data collected from NTDC is compared with the simulation model and it 
varies in accordance to collected data. After that the transmission line is simulated with TCSC 
installed, the resulting outcome of transmission line shows that it transfers power in a range of 35

to 42 MW per phase. This power transmission capacity can be raised to 54MW by providing 24% 
compensation as shown by the simulated model. That results in an overall improvement of 49% 
The model is then simulated to achieve compensation of 72% when the transmission line is driven 
to upper thermal limit. The results of this simulation represent that the line could transfer power 
up to156 MW with an overall improvement of 298%. This much improvement might undergo 
stability issues so it can be assumed as hypostatical value it can be achieve if it is allowed by 
system constraints.

Abstract 
This paper presents the Document Management Systems (DMS) as a support decision tool to optimize Toyota Caetano 
Portugal S.A. (TCAP) processes performance. The created systems were developed on the best practices of a Business 
Project Management (BPM), for better structural implementation. The first system implementation was related to the 
warehouse materials requirement process, where an excel template with VBA functions for fill automatization was 
built. It had a reduction of the overall paper consumption and time execution optimization, which means the gain of 
approximately of 0,10€ and 2,09€ per unit produced, respectively. It was also obtained an elimination of 4538 paper 
sheets per year. A second system was also developed, in order to provide a Decision Support System (DSS) for 
documental management. Several User Forms were developed in VBA code in order to provide a flexible and 
intuitively user interface experience. It reduced the users time decision making and the administrator maintenance, by 
a total of 26 minutes, corresponding to a 1,61€ reduction per unit built, which means an efficiency increase of 42%. 
The present work fits in the company's strategy for a more sustainable environment being a positive driver of Industry 
4.0 implementation.

Relatively to the second problem, a database maintenance of the LC70 series components were made in an Excel 
sheet, consisting of 3000 lines and 40 columns, leading to a lack of traceability, very little flexible and agile data 
research and edition and none historic record of changes made. 
Then, it was developed an DSS for documental management, which allowed the user to add, edit, duplicate, delete 
and search in a flexible and fast way every data needed, leading to an increase of productivity. The user, when 
searching by component, has also access to the corresponding image for better identification and decision making. 
The administrator is the one who will do all the database maintenance in a very intuitive and effective way. 
The table presented below, Table 4, shows that the IS developed was successfully implemented by providing a better 
workflow of information and by reducing the time decision making from the user: an average of 65 minutes to 38 
minutes, equivalent to a cost reduction of 1,61 € per unit built.

Conclusion 
Nowadays, to compete in a highly competitive market, it is essential that the organization take on the performance, 
which is the challenge of continuous improvement related with lean thinking methodology. The constant demand for 
process optimization allows the organization to respond to the growing needs of its owns customers. The goal is to 
manufacture the best product at the lowest cost as quickly as possible. These new systems used information and 
communication for an extensively autonomous information exchange, being able to combine production with business 
processes. Following the Industry 4.0 trend, these implemented systems decentralized manufacture in a smart way. 
They provided self-decision optimization, better data organization and, consequently, supply chain traceability. 
The elaboration of this project demonstrated that, to achieve relevant improvements, substantial investments or 
complex solutions are not needed. Using the resources available by the company, it was possible to reach the defined 
objectives and to present results that support the improvements obtained. 
The results achieved show the fulfilment of the objectives and the constraints proposed. The first system 
implementation, related to the warehouse materials requirement process had a reduction of the overall paper 
consumption and time execution optimization, less 0,10€ and 2,09€ per unit produced were gained, respectively. The 
elimination of 4538 paper sheets per year was also obtained. On the other hand, the second system reduced the users 
time decision making and the administrator maintenance, from 65 to 38 minutes, corresponding to a 1,61€ reduction 
per unit built. 
Therefore, it was demonstrated with the implementation, that the solution developed was accessible to all stakeholders 
in the process, the systems management was simple and it was autonomously assumed by the employees involved.

Future Optimization 
Since all methodology of continuous improvement is adjacent to the Toyota spirit, the projects carried out will never 
be completed and there is always room for improvement over time. In the first system developed, the real time 
synchronization with the ERP system of the company, is one of the main improvements listed to be done. This will 
provide a constant database update, eliminating information errors. Relatively to the second system, the creation of an 
action which leads to a print document of all the necessary items listed is the optimization to be made.

Abstract 
The prediction of the production of food is a very important topic that is attracting more the attention of 
researchers, scholars and professionals in the field of business and management since it is currently an issue 
at a global level considering the shortage of food and the exponential increase of the population. Similarly, 
the development of forecasting models about production are commonly used by different researchers and 
scholars to create predictions of the production systems, including good, as they normally provide valuable 
information for both making business decisions and reducing costs. For this reason, the main objective of 
this empirical research is the proposal of a forecast production model by applying a case study for a family 
agro-industrial enterprise from Aguascalientes (Mexico) through the implementation of a computer system 
that improves significantly their planning and commercial system of agro-industrial products (i.e. broccoli).

1. Introduction
Agriculture has been playing an essential role in the production of food since the last decade, for a population that has 
increased exponentially through the production of more and better food (Hawkes and Ruel, 2006; McDermott et al., 
2013). However, despite all the different efforts made by agro-industrial enterprises and small scale farmers to 
incorporate more available land to produce more crops with a substantial increase in calories to reduce food insecurity, 
undernourishment and famine present in different developing countries, as it is the case of Mexico, these efforts have 
not been enough because they have not achieved the expected results, as the number of people with undernourishment 
and famine is still growing in part due to the high quality standards that some regions of the world establish (Akerele 
and Musediku, 2017).

Abstract 
The ISO standards provide a mechanism for organizations that desire to persistently address their clients' issues 
through their items and services and constantly improve in quality. This paper looks at how the profundity of ISO 
9001 execution impacts organization performance over the long haul. The study was conducted to determine the ISO 
standards on project quality deliverables, to determine its relationship with regard to employees’ quality of work in a 
project. This study investigates two main questions; (1) Can ISO standards influence the end product or services? (2) 
Can the introduction of the standards affect how employees think with regards to quality? This research follows a 
mixed approach, which is a combination of both the qualitative and quantitative approach. Data collection techniques 
used include a random choice of research members from the examination populace in a fair-minded way, the 
institutionalized poll or intercession they get, and statistical strategies used to break down the information. The results 
indicate that the employees in Company X believe that an introduction will significantly enhance execution. It is 
suggested that associations ought to receive ISO standards in their daily practices, which will gradually increase the 
job effectiveness of the employees in the organization.

1. Introduction
Quality affirmation has turned out to be normal practice in numerous organizations which predominantly implement 
the ISO 9000 standards, which are often integrated Quality Management System (QMS) (Galetto, et al, 2015).  An 
increasing number of studies examined the crucial keys of implementing an international certification, in particular 
significant of ISO 9000 in different scales (Miller, et al, 2017). The focus however has been mainly on the process of 
integrating different aspect including the design and implementation the strategy of the organization (Bernardo, et al, 
2016). The ISO standards provides mechanism for organizations that desire to continuously meet their clients' needs 
through their items and administrations and constantly improve in quality (Basir and Davies, 2016). Due to the fact that 
certification necessitates scrutiny of the third party, it also improves the relationship with the supplier and enable the 
organization to secure resources (Miller, et al, 2017). 
The main objectives for implementing ISO in organizations are: (1) to develop and sustain the ability to meet customer 
demand, (2) to increase competitive advantage, (3) to meet government regulations and (4) to develop the ability to 
reduce operational costs, amongst others (Bernardo, et al, 2016). However, Basir and Davies (2016) state that there are 
serious concerns in the implementation of ISO standards, such as high cost linked to training, the transformation journey 
not being properly received by organization members, and the reduction of effectiveness and efficiency over time. 
Researchers around have attempted to discover a connection between ISO accreditation and business execution, 
attaining disputatious outcomes (Bernardo, et al, 2016).

From the interviews conducted it has been found that ISO 9001 has been implemented in Company X for over three 
years. Based on the results obtained from interviews carried out, majority of the employees working on the 
refurbishment project at Company X believes that the introduction of ISO 9001 has led to improved quality of end 
products which confirms the findings of Question 1 from the survey. However, a small group of participants indicated 
that company still experienced deviations from project’s targets. These deviations were mostly due to the fact that 
some employees were still not familiar with the ISO standard, although it has been implemented for three years. 
 
Findings from the interviews also indicated that the introduction of ISO 9001 did not lead to the expected mindset 
change of employees regarding quality at Company X refurbishment project. This perception is demonstrated by the 
very even YES/NO 47%/53% response rate to Question 2 of the survey. The setting at Company X refurbishment 
project is a microcosm of Eskom as a whole but also can be seen as a SMME or small business in the service industry 
with (+/- 60 employees). However, there has been concerns that the expected mindset change could not be achieved 
due to a lack of quality champion to drive the ISO 9001 introduction within Company X. 
 
5. Conclusion, Recommendations and the Way Forward 
 
The results indicate that the employees in Company X believe that the introduction of ISO 9001 will significantly 
improve performance. However, this introduction should be supported by management commitment as some 
employees, although not opposed to change, might find it difficult to align themselves with the new standards. Shafiq, 
et al, (2014) state that the ISO certification position organisations for higher levels of performance. Hence the ISO 
certification have been endorsed internationally for years (Wu and Jang, 2013).  
 
There are recommended standards to different organisations that can expand the credibility of any organisation and 
assist in increasing the productivity of the organisation (Shafiq, et al, 2014). Ratnasingam, et al (2013) and Miller, et 
al, (2017) affirms that ISO certification have a positive influence in the organisational processes and the competency 
of management. It is recommended that organisations should adopt ISO standards in their daily practices, which will 
gradually increase the job effectiveness of the employees in the organisation (Basir and Davies, 2016). Additionally, 
it is recommended that Company X involves an employee whose primary task would be to champion the 
implementation of the ISO standard. 
 
This study sets the foundation for further research that may consider reviewing the state of affairs of ISO standard 
implementation in SMMEs to provide a clear view of the extent of ISO 9001 adoption in the industry. Further research 
may also consider looking into the factors that may prevent or advance the adoption of ISO standards within the power 
plant refurbishment companies.

Abstract 
Energy efficiency projects are often executed by specialized entities, namely energy service companies 
(ESCOs). A typical ESCO's core business is conducted using performance-based contracts, whereby 
payment terms depend on the energy savings achieved. Despite their success in public, commercial, and 
industrial sectors, ESCOs in the residential sector are involved in fewer projects and face several challenges. 
First, an energy efficiency project often leads to changed consumption behavior; hence it is more difficult 
to evaluate the energy savings that are due to the project itself. The second challenge is that residential 
clients are more risk averse and, thus, less willing to contract for projects whose outcomes are uncertain. 
Third, a lack of monitoring protocols leads to ESCO's moral hazard problems. This paper studies ESCO 
contract design issues, focusing primarily on the residential market for energy efficiency. As opposed to 
other sectors, coordinating contracts do not exist. We show, however, that simple piecewise linear contracts 
work reasonably well. To improve their profitability, ESCOs can reduce uncertainty about the technology 
employed and/or develop ways of verifying post-project energy efficiency. Since policy makers are 
understandably keen to promote energy efficiency, we show also how regulations and monetary incentives 
can reduce inefficiencies in ESCOs' relationships and thereby maximize environmental benefits.

Abstract  
In this paper, various changes are presented on devices that transmit long-distance electromagnetic frequencies for 
product location (RFID). This research aims to improve the characteristics of a Tag by changing its coating to ensure 
that it can tolerate working with higher temperatures than it currently supports (240 ° C). The objective is to 
introduce these modified Tags in a company dedicated to the pressurized cutting of ""foam"" by means of presses and 
dies for the automotive industry. The implementation of RFID in the automotive plant aims to improve the current 
inventory system, minimize set-up times, which will lead us to minimize process times and company costs.

1. Introduction  
 
In recent years, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been characterized with an increasing number 
of applications involving many RFID readers (eg. supply chain management, traceability management and 
intelligent transport systems). (tan and Zainol, 2018) RFID is a technology of wireless sensors, based on the 
detection of electromagnetic signals and radio frequencies, which are used to capture and transmit data from or to a 
label (Domdouzis et al., 2007). Its ability to store and retrieve item data remotely can be used to replace traditional 
element identification and data capture approaches. If RFID technology is applied to the logistics industry under a 
more general environment, a reduction in logistics costs can be expected (Kim and Sohn, 2009). RFID has been used 
extensively to improve the processes of warehouses and distribution centers, logistics, and the management of 
inventories through the supply chain (Chongwatpol and Sharda, 2013). Huang et al. (2007) suggest that an approach 
based on RFID technology can improve the visibility and traceability of shopfloor information in real time in a 
flexible fixed-line assembly for mobile workers. The main objective of this work is to use RFID technology to 
control the inventory system in a company that has products in a high temperature system. Currently, the labels used 
for the RFID process can withstand temperatures below 240 ° C, due to this situation the modification of the TAG 
encapsulation is sought so that it can withstand temperatures higher than those currently supported by the TAG and 
that this encapsulation does not interfere in the sending of the information that this TAG has recorded. 
 
2. Theoretical Framework 
 
The radio frequency identification (RFID) brought the automatic detection of the object by electromagnetic waves, 
without the requirement of physical contact. As the costs of this technology diminish, RFID systems are increasingly 
implemented in varied environments (Liu et al., 2018). An RFID system is generally composed of three elements, a 
label placed on the object that wants to be identified, a reader with its antenna that communicates with the label 
without having to be in direct line and a server equipped with a middleware responsible for the administrarion of the 
system and the interaction with the information systems of the organization. Tags can be defined as the basic

4. Conclusion 
 
This paper presented the need to improve inventory control of a company that has several products that are subjected 
to temperatures higher than 200 ° C. The introduction of RFID systems in inventory control is a competitive 
advantage since it reduces the operating costs of these processes. The innovation involves designing a plastic 
encapsulation for the TAG that can tolerate temperatures of 240 ° C. The methodology proposed in this work 
includes the incorporation of a modified process to what is currently done in PET production. To tolerate high 
temperatures, it is proposed to crystallize the PET to obtain an opaque crystalline plastic as demonstrated in the 
chemical equations presented above. The TAG, has behaved stable even with high temperatures and the information 
that has been assigned is information that has been maintained within the TAG. The instability is lost by the 
encapsulated plastic of the TAG since previously designing a TAG for high temperatures was not a necessity for any 
company. The design of the TAG package has been possible from a fundamentally theoretical perspective; the 
components (raw material) to make the encapsulation are difficult to obtain to be able to experiment, nevertheless, 
this work concluded its feasibility and its technical viability. With the implementation of the RFID system for the 
control of inventories, a considerable reduction was observed in the time lost in the search of parts without a specific 
location. Another important impact was accomplished with the reduction in the stop time for lines with missing 
tools. All of this was achieved with the development of access to the exact location of the pieces that have the TAG 
and with its technical description. This article provides an innovative option to allow the TAG of the RFID system 
to withstand high temperatures. Another advantage of the system is the feasibility of its implementation in parts that 
undergo treatments or processes with temperatures above 240 ° C without limiting its scope.

Abstract 
Operational Excellence is highly essential for the growth of the organizations and all sizes industries, due to its 
characteristics of search of quality, efficiency and effectiveness of enterprises. In this article, it has been developed a 
work of revision of Operational Excellence (OE) concept. Since there is not a clear and precise definition of this 
term, the main objective of this research is to perform an analysis of the current literature of OE model, for the 
formulation of a formal concept through a consistent interpretation. This will help is us to improve the 
implementation of OE in different companies. The used concepts by the main authors were analyzed in a 
compendium of 122 documents covered from the year 1993 – 2018. The articles were selected using the keyword 
Operational Excellence in the databases that appears in Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science. Subsequently, 54 
of the 122 articles were worked to do a population study and this was the result. In these articles, it was searched the 
comparison of theoretical proposals and the gaps confrontations that are identified for redefining the concept already 
mentioned.

1. Introduction
Operational Excellence is the enablers development to generate competitive benefits in a dynamic environment 
based in an organizational resources (adaptability). The composition and expansion of enablers in the basis for 
continuous improvement, change and optimization of commercial processes. Therefore, “OE is the dynamic 
capability to realize effective and efficient core processes in the value creation chain utilizing technological, cultural 
and organizational factors in an integrative way and based on the respective strategy.” (Gleich R, Sauter 2008). 
“Excellence in operations is about how the operations side of the business supports business growth as a strategic 
part of business.” (Duggan KJ, 2011). According to Dalluege, an organization only route towards excellence is to use 
stakeholder needs as input for the development and assessment of a strategy and its respective guidelines. 
Furthermore, organizations should strive to continuously fulfil stakeholder expectations, (Dalluege C. Exzellenz 
2012). Today’s competitive and globalized market conditions force organizations not only to react reactively to 
survive prevailing challenges, but also to seek long-term success, (Jovane et al., 2008), by achieving excellence in 
their business. If operational excellence is practiced, firms aim to have lean and mean processes. The result delivers 
value to customers at low prices and convenience. Firms applying customer intimacy focus on knowing their 
customers and building close relationships with them (Langerak et al., 2003). One way to gain operational excellence 
is to reduce the waste both in the value chain activities as well as in the linkages among them. Research indicates that 
wasted time compromises about 60 percent of total operational time in most businesses (Farhad & Deba 2005). The 
research focuses on publications generated from 1993 to 2018. The search process is an iterative process carried out 
by placing the keywords “operational excellence”, “performance excellence”, “operations excellence”, “business 
excellence”, “enterprise excellence "". The sequence of the research follows the following parameters: with an 
agglomeration of 122 articles, a population study is carried out with a result of 54 articles, which in turn were 
ordered from highest to lowest according to their impact factor, an analysis of the collected information was made, 
the most relevant information was concentrated in 4 tables with key words and their respective number of 
occurrences, this with the objective of identifying the characteristics, tools, methodologies and measurable most 
significantly. Finally define overall Operational Excellence. The scope of our research is to be able to clearly and 
precisely define the concept of Operational Excellence for a better understanding of the term.

Abstract 
To maintain their business competitiveness, manufacturing, telecommunication, and service companies develop 
their facilities and systems having optimal service rates and numbers of servers to function efficiently and 
effectively. These systems are best modeled as closed finite queueing network models and state dependent queues. 
However, because of blocking in these finite queueing networks, the optimal service rates and number of servers 
allocation issue is a challenging nonlinear mixed integer optimization problem. To tackle this difficult mathematical 
problem, first, we propose a queue decomposition method together with a nonlinear sequential quadratic 
optimization algorithm. Extensive analyses and resolution of small topologies are performed and we show that the 
results are very encouraging and very close to those of simulation but requiring only a fraction of CPU times. Then, 
this methodology is applied to larger supply chain topologies including a car-body shop case study where most of 
the operations are performed by robots that load and weld stamped steel parts. We show that the model yields 
encouraging results. Finally, from these various experiments, we propose a set of recommendations and managerial 
insights relative to the importance of joint optimization of various performance measures in such systems.

Abstract 
 
Big Data is a technology that aims to capture, store, manage, and analyze large numbers of data with 
different types: structured, semi-structured and unstructured. These data are guided by the rule of the 5 
Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity and Value. To analyze a large amount of information coming 
from several sources, the technological world of Big Data is based on clearly identified tools, including 
the Hadoop Framework and the Apache Spark. Hadoop allows massive data storage with the Hadoop 
Distributed File System (HDFS) model, as well as the analysis with the MapReduce model, on a cluster 
that has one or more machines. Apache Spark analysis the distributed data, but it doesn’t contain a system 
storage. This article presents a comparative between the Big Data analysis methods offered by Hadoop 
and Spark, their architectures, operating modes and performances. Indeed, We have first begun by a 
general overview of Big Data technology. We discuss about the Hadoop Framework and their 
components: HDFS and MapReduce the first element of our comparison, we offer a study of their 
methodology, their mode of data processing and their architecture, at the end of this section we present 
the Hadoop Ecosystem. We then continue with Apache Spark Framework the second element of our 
study, we expos their features, their Ecosystem and their mode of analysis of large data. At the end, we 
compare these last two elements Hadoop and Spark based on a detailed study.

1. Introduction 
 
The Big Data term origins was raised by the Meta Group research firm (now Gartner) in 2001 (Laney, 2001). This 
concept has profoundly transformed our society and it has became a new technology focus both in science and in 
industry. It is obvious that we are living at the era of the data deluge, evidenced by the huge volume of data 
collected from different sources and by the growth rate of the data generated (Corp, 2014). The question is: Where 
does this data come from?  
The movement began in the 2000s with the birth of Web 2.0, the emergence of social networks, the development of 
smartphones and continued with the orientation towards connected objects (Institut Montaigne, 2015). All messages, 
all documents, all images and videos shared, for example on Facebook, Twitter or Google represent a data. The IDC 
(International Data Corporation) report (Gantz & Reinsel, 2011) predicts that, from 2005 to 2020, the overall 
volume of data can grow from one hundred and thirty exabytes to forty thousand exabytes, representing double 
growth every two years. 
The Big Data approach has a strong impact on many sectors: finance, health, public sector and more (Corp, 2016). 
In fact, the data are presented as a new gold, which should be discovered and exploited, for instance, the Mckinsey 
report (McKinsey & Company, 2011) states that the potential value of global personal location data is estimated to 
be $100 billion in revenue to service providers over the next ten years and be as much as $700 billion in value to 
consumer, business and users. 
Today, the biggest problem is the analysis of mass data with all the constraints and difficulties surrounding it. This 
challenge offers new opportunities in terms of information management, and understanding of structured data and 
unstructured allows improved the results directly.

challenge. 
 
Figure 9. The results correspond to Daytona Graysort Challenge for Cluster disk 
throughput, Cores and Nodes 
 
Figure 10. The results correspond to Daytona Graysort Challenge for Sort rate/node, 
Sort rate and Network 
Apache Spark really wins the challenge, it achieves superior performance than Hadoop MapReduce clusters on 
sorting. Which means a great work of the team that is behind Spark, and also demonstrates that Spark is fulfilling its 
promise to serve as a faster and more scalable engine for data processing of all sizes GBs, TBs and PBs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
To conclude, firstly Hadoop has a powerful distributed storage file (HDFS), with performances and features that are 
available for Big Data processing systems such as Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark. Hadoop MapReduce is a 
platform built for batch processing. It was very famous and very usable by multiple companies in several areas, 
because Hadoop MapReduce was the first technology that analyze mass distributed data.  
On the other hand, Apache Spark is the new brightest platform on the Big Data technology, it has better 
performances. The Spark is very profitable thanks to the data processing in memory, it is compatible with all of the 
data sources and file formats of Hadoop, also it has several APIs. Apache Spark even includes graph processing and 
machine-learning capabilities. 
Although some companies feel compelled to choose between Hadoop and Spark, the fact that isn't a direct fight. 
They are complementary technologies that work in tandem in some cases, or separately in other cases, depending on 
the data or the desired results. The truth is that Spark and Hadoop have a dependent relationship with each other. 
Hadoop provides options that Spark doesn't possess like HDFS, and Spark provides real-time, in-memory 
processing. The perfect scenario of Big Data, is that Hadoop and Spark work together on the same team. 
Our future work would focus on the Big Data analytics approach, more specifically in the area of health in Morocco.  
What we want precisely is to design a new model of treatment that is interested to health data, with powerful 
techniques and technologies of Big Data, which will benefit from the advantages and powers of the two Frameworks 
Hadoop and Spark. This model will take in two methods of treatment: the batch-processing paradigm and the real-
time processing paradigm.

Abstract: 
The egg is composed of three components viz. egg shell, egg white, egg yolk. Egg has rich protein and nutrient 
quantity. The egg when soaked in vinegar show physical change such that its shell becomes very soft to touch. This 
is due to the egg is put in vinegar; the calcium carbonate of the shell reacts chemically with the vinegar's acid. This 
reaction is named oxidation. In every chemical reaction, the initial substances disappear and they transform into new 
substances. After a few minutes we observe the formation of little bubbles, meaning a gas is being generated. It 
becomes just like a water balloon but the study says that it’s a rubber egg whereas the egg does not show any rubber 
like property. Finally, the egg increased in size because the liquid in the container has passed through the semi 
permeable membrane and has entered the egg. After the 24 hours we proved the egg bounces at different heights. 
Also study says that egg when placed in vinegar solution and after becoming soft it becomes hard when kept open to 
atmosphere but the experimental setup and the observation helps to prove this false. The egg vinegar also has many 
medical uses.

Side Effects of the Vinegar egg: 
 
 The Illinois Department of Public Health was notified by a local physician about a possible case of food borne 
botulism. This report summarizes the case investigation, which implicated home-pickled eggs as the cause. 
 
On November 23, 1997, a previously healthy 68-year-old man became nauseated, vomited, and complained of 
abdominal pain. During the next 2 days, he developed diplopia, dysarthria, and respiratory impairment, necessitating 
hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Physical examination confirmed multiple cranial nerve abnormalities, 
including extra ocular motor palsy and diffuse flaccid paralysis. Possible botulism was diagnosed, and a one-vial 
dose of trivalent (types A, B, and E) antibotulinum toxin was administered. A sample of the patient's serum 
collected before antitoxin administration demonstrated the presence of type B botulinum toxin. A food history 
revealed no exposures to home-canned products; however, the patient had eaten pickled eggs that he had prepared 7 
days before onset of illness; gastrointestinal symptoms began 12 hours after ingestion. The patient recovered after 
prolonged supportive care. 
 
Botulism 
Botulism is a paralytic illness caused by the neurotoxin produced by the bacterium C. botulinum. Paralysis first 
affects the cranial nerves, then the skeletal muscles; untreated intoxications can lead to dense flaccid paralysis, 
respiratory failure, and death. (7) 
 
Clostiridum Botulinum 
It is the name of bacteria causing “Foodborne Botulism”. The effects of the Foodborne Botulism are found in a 
person within 18-36 hours of exposure. It lasts for 6 hours to 8 days.  
 
Diagnosis 
This disease is suspected in a person with gastro intestinal symptoms associated to drying of mouth, difficult 
focusing of eyes and cranial nerves dysfunction. The initial stage should be recognized by the history and physical 
findings of person. This should be done before confirmatory test as it takes several days to be performed. Stools and 
food consumed by person should be tested for the presence of botulinum. 
 
First Aid Measures 
The stomach of the person should be emptied by making him voit the food consumed. This should be done within an 
hour. 
 
Antidote 
One vial equine antitoxin should be administered by infusion. Conduct Sensitivity, Cutaneous, Serum reaction over 
equine tests. 
 
C. Botulinum produces heat resistant pores. This spores increases in foods with higher pH and a lower salt 
content. The growth of this botulinum can be inhibited by high temperature, acidification, dehydration, 
salination, and certain food preservatives.    
 
Conclusion 
Vinegar and eggs have rich nutrients. In this study, the mixed form of derived products, vinegar–egg solution and its 
products helps to contradict the concept of the rubber egg and gives a stand to water balloon egg. The vinegar egg 
has high content of nutrients still many people don’t know about its medicinal use. The recipes if used properly then 
it can help to cure that particular disease. Every coin has two sides just like that it has side effects if the eggs are 
pickled for long time in vinegar solution then they can be rotten and eating such eggs can be harmful for the health. 
A frequent study found that this vinegar eggs can be used as anticancer. The study says that when the egg soaked 
from vinegar solution is kept open to atmosphere it becomes hard again which is contradictory. The egg shrinks as it 
losses the water content which it absorbed due to osmosis process from the vinegar solution. This egg when placed 
again in the water swells. This shows osmosis and reverse osmosis process takes place in this process. Also, if any 
color is added to vinegar solution then the egg gains the same color. This is because of the process of osmosis some

of the color enters in the membrane with the water. The egg is not only a rich source of nutrient but also resistant to 
many diseases. We hope it would be helpful for all the readers there are many other concepts yet to get still this 
small concept would help to resist from many common disease.

Abstract 
One of the key assets of an Ecommerce platform is its logistics services. First Mile Logistics is a term usually 
applied to the leg of supply chain which is responsible for picking products from sellers and delivering them to the 
hub or warehouse of an ecommerce company. Effectively defined key process indicators in any organization help 
them to be both efficient and effective. 
By applying the methodology discussed in this paper an E-commerce organization of global repute was able to 
successfully define the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) related to its First Mile Logistics section of the overall 
supply chain. The KPI tree helped the organization to create a supply chain reliability measurement and control 
visualization platform that enabled it to control the existing process, identify and resolve assignable abnormalities 
there by ensuring stable supply chain. A well designed KPI tree will also enable an organization with insights 
required for future capability building.

1. Overview of Supply Chain Logistics Ecosystem
E-Commerce organizations across the world usually resort to a two-prong approach to cater to their customer demand.
Products purchased online by the customers, will be fulfilled either from the Inventory placed in the fulfillment centers
(FC) or warehouses or through marketplace created by aggregations of sellers who are listed in the platform and can
cater to the orders placed by customers. Once the purchasing cycle is over the product flows through the fulfillment
cycle within the supply chain before it is delivered to the customer at his doorstep.
The detail processes are as explained below: 
For marketplace model, the process starts from picking up the shipments from seller’s location and connecting it to 
the sortation center. In case of inventory led model, the products are procured from sellers, brands, original equipment

Conclusion 
 
Through this paper we wanted to demonstrate the process and the philosophy that can be adopted by any E-
Commerce organization to define KPI tree for any leg of their supply chain. The paper clearly articulates the 
benefits of a KPI tree for any organization to manage its present and to plan for its future. We also touched upon 
how to identify the key guiding factors for any supply chain design. We spoke about how process map and FMEA 
acts like essential building blocks of any KPI tree. Finally, through the representation of a KPI tree visualization 
dashboard we wanted to communicate how the theory and practical application can be seamlessly merged to create 
an ecosystem of better monitor and control of any supply chain.

Abstract 
Growing awareness towards the sustainability has compelled supply chain domain experts to explore its relevance in 
this context. As a result, a number of studies in recent years have focused on investigating sustainable supply chain 
practices across the globe. Short food supply chains (SFSCs) have emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to 
the industrialized agro-food supply systems. However, academic literature hasn’t fully explored the linkage between 
SFSCs and sustainability. This study therefore aims to explore how SFSCs conforms to the dimensions of 
sustainability using the sustainability framework (social, economic, and environmental). The findings are based on a 
systematic literature review of 44 articles published between 2000 and 2018 selected from six electronic databases 
was used for the analysis. All items were properly analyzed by the researchers, seeking to identify the relationship or 
proximity of the information found in the papers with the SFSC concept. Our studies highlight the societal, 
environmental and cultural benefits of SFSC in addition to the associated economic and safety benefits. Our study 
thus, adds to the scant literature on SFSCs and shows a clear linkage between SFSCs and five-dimensional 
sustainability framework. We also propose a set of research questions that sets direction for future research.

Abstract 
Many academic institutions outside the United States have become an ABET accredited programs over the past 
decade, and many more are expressing interest in becoming one. Alike their counterparts in the United States, ABET-
accredited engineering programs must maintain and adapt curricula, student outcomes and educational objectives that 
reflect and respond to the needs of industry and the engineering discipline seeking accreditation. For engineering 
programs with little prior knowledge about ABET and its requirements, including defining the program constituencies, 
collecting data and acquiring systematic feedback, and interpreting outcomes are often challenging.  Although a large 
number of engineering programs outside of the United States established an advisory board for their respective 
programs, there are not many reports published to show how the programs have capitalized on and benefited from the 
wealth of knowledge and experience collectively exist in this group. 
The Petroleum Engineering Program at Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) recently conducted a survey and 
collected information for its Advisory Board. The Petroleum Engineering Advisory Board comprises of nineteen 
members with high visibility and prominent leadership positions in their respective organizations. This paper reports 
on the data collected through this survey and key suggestions made by this distinguished group of leaders to further 
improve the program’s impacts.

1. Introduction
Texas A&M University at Qatar strives to offer students the highest quality engineering education. The Petroleum 
Engineering Program become a premier provider in the area, graduating engineers of exceptional quality. Like others, 
the program constantly evaluate our outcomes and work towards continuously enhancing our learning offers to the 
739","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

student and for the benefit of future employers. Advisory board identifies opportunities for continuous improvement 
of the undergraduate program curriculum, based on oil and gas industry experience with graduates and alignment with 
current and anticipated future industry needs. Reflecting on the current offers and clear feedback from faculty, students, 
and advisory board, the program also feel the need to equip better the students with some of the non-technical skills 
that had better prepare them for the workplace. Successful students require not only excel within their disciplines, but 
also have the ability and propensity to engage in cross-disciplinary work, communicate effectively with multiple 
audiences, and work alongside professionals in different fields. 
 
 
2. Continuous Improvement in Curriculum and Workplace Skills 
Texas A&M University’s College of Engineering strives to provide its students with a high-quality education that will 
prepare them for a wide range of careers at the forefront of the engineering field. The curriculum is designed to 
accomplish this by closely integrating cutting-edge basic and applied research with innovative classroom instruction. 
Petroleum Engineering is primarily concerned with the safe and economic extraction of oil, gas and other natural 
resources from the earth. This is accomplished through the design, drilling and operation wells and well systems, and 
the integrated management of the underground reservoirs in which the resources are found. The curriculum includes 
study of:  
• 
Design and analysis of well systems and procedures for drilling and completing wells. 
• 
Characterization and evaluation of subsurface geological formations and their resources. 
• 
Design and analysis of systems for producing, injecting and handling fluids 
• 
Application of reservoir engineering principles and practices for optimizing resource development and 
management 
• 
Use of project economics and resource valuation methods for design and decision making under conditions 
of risk and uncertainty. 
 
The advisory members of petroleum engineering program are carefully selected from among companies located in 
Qatar; boards represent key industry stakeholders such as experienced industry leaders, senior alumni (former 
students), and employers of graduates. The board members are a diverse mixture of Qatari nationals and expatriates 
from around the world with impressive representation of female engineers. The board members are aware of their 
responsibility and the university’s expectations by meeting twice a year, participating in senior design projects by 
identifying projects for eligible students, attending the final presentations of senior projects, meeting with students 
and conduct exit interviews, and actively participate and be informed of ABET requirements. The board members 
support the program to develop ‘a knowledge-based economy as mandated by leaders of the State of Qatar’ thru 
building human capacity as one of the country’s main pillars to achieve on the strategy development goals and meeting 
the country’s demand for technical expertise. The board strategically involves in assessing future needs of the program. 
 
The advisory board conducted survey and collected information from alumni who have completed at least three years 
on the job post-graduation, recent graduates, supervisor, and mentors of recent graduates, and among the board 
members. The key improvement themes for these initiatives are: 
• 
Enhance integration across subjects – “bringing it together.” 
• 
Increase practical and industry experience opportunity 
 
As additional, some skills areas that the board highlighted as important for entering the workplace, such as: 
• 
Business communication (writing emails, reports, public speaking, presentation skills, phone calls, meetings) 
and interpersonal communication and listening skills (dealing with others, exchange of information with 
colleagues, cultural tolerance, respect of others, carefully listening and hearing messages and tasks, etc.) 
• 
Understanding Accountability  
• 
Time management (punctuality with working hours and project/task deadlines; multi-tasking and managing 
to complete tasks in a timely manner under pressure) 
 
3. Conclusion 
Active participation of the program advisory board should raise their confidence in the program graduates’ job 
preparedness. Program assessment and feedback loops allow programs and the board members to meaningfully 
participate in program assessment and develop essential input for the program. The program should consistently ask 
for their input regarding curricula, senior design projects, and students’ experiential learning.

Abstract 
The implementation of Senior High School program in the Philippine educational system requires the national 
government to provide funding to public high schools to address students’ different needs because of different 
demands required by the different academic tracks offered such as General Academic Strand (GAS), Humanities and 
Social Sciences (HUMSS), Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and Accountancy and 
Business Management (ABM).  However, there are no standardized budget allocation guidelines being followed by 
the implementing public high schools.  The lack of a defined and standardized budget allocation process poses a threat 
on mismanagement of the available budget. Through the defined factors and quantifying the prioritization of the 
different learning outcomes of the academic programs into priority weights, this paper intends to develop a budget 
allocation model using Goal Programming. The budget allocation model was developed using the data of different 
public schools in Cavite.  The results showed an improvement on the achievement of priority weights by an average 
of 24.76%. The budget allocation model was also translated into a system to allow the public schools to generate the 
satisficing results on any given year and interpret results with the aid of analytics on the formulated budget.

1. Introduction
Education, defined as the method of acquiring knowledge in preparation for becoming an intellectual person, is one 
of the rights that is strongly promoted by the government by offering free education in public schools. To improve the 
quality of education in the Philippines, K-12 curriculum was implemented. Adding two more years, for the senior high 
school and introduction of the tracks from which graduating junior high school students may choose from. Academic 
tracks consist of specialized courses: General Academic Strand (GAS), Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS), 
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), and Accountancy and Business Management (ABM). 
While other tracks such as Technical-Vocational Livelihood, Sports, and Arts and Design Track are also available to 
choose from. Further enhancements involve reforms on the structure (number of years), curriculum (guided by UbD) 
and assessment (Okabe, 2013). The additional years for the basic education have posed several issues which had been 
addressed by increased education funding. Aside from the macro-scale issues on fund management, funds 
management within the schools that offer SHS lack system on funds allocation that will satisfy the varying needs of 
the Senior High School (SHS) program.  
Previous studies regarding budget management and allocation have been conducted.  A study conducted by Behrman, 
Deolalikar, and Lee-Ying (2002) in the Philippines stated that although decentralization had contributed to increase 
in quality of primary education, insignificant effects were reflected for secondary education due to lacking 
arrangements and policies for the secondary level. This may be accounted to the lack of guidelines on how funds may 
be utilized in the secondary sector and the unclear role of secondary education in the development of students. (Okabe, 
2013). Previous studies also suggest that budget allocation priority must be based on student needs (Bramley, Watkins 
and Karley, 2011) than staff and maintenance needs. Miles and Roza (2006) also pointed out that staff-based allocation 
provides different amount of budget allocated per student for different districts and shifting to student-focused 
budgeting will provide equity on financial allocation, in which a baseline for the basic needs for the students are set 
and a formula is followed for shifting of student needs which will be the drive for the budget distribution. Furthermore, 
the staff-based allocation may be contributory to the lower quality of education received in public schools than in

Figure 5. Analytics 
The report shown in Figure 5 are the analytics. The analytics contain graphs and charts that show how the budget is 
distributed among the strands, and the expense item.  
Furthermore, the system is connected to an MS Access database to save the previous years’ achievement ratios and 
budget allocation. This aids the user to determine how the budget allocation generated is performing compared with 
the previous years’ budget allocation. Below the Trend of Over-All Achievement Ratio chart, the trend of achievement 
for the priority weights.  
In summary, the researchers found the most significant budget items, and related them to student needs by analyzing 
the previous and current year’s expenses of the schools. These expenses are estimated and standardized for the model. 
Using the standardized minimum expenses, the budget available, and the learning outcomes’ priority weights, a 
mathematical model was formulated. The mathematical model is a goal programming model to reach a compromise 
between all the available constraints. The indicator of the effect of mathematical model are reflected in the 
achievement of learning outcomes where an increase of an average of 24.76% for the schools. To allow the schools 
to utilize the mathematical model at different states/school years, the researcher designed a program that will generate 
the detailed budget allocation.  
4. Conclusion 
 
The formula used in formulating a budget for the Senior High School is referred to as Boncodin formula. The variables 
in the formula are the number of students, number of classrooms and number of teachers. These variables are the 
initial factors considered in the budget formulation. The actual expenditures were also analyzed to determine how the 
budget formulated from the Boncodin formula was spent and found that most of the expenses were expenses directly 
related to students’ needs. These expenses are the: electricity expenses and, supplies and materials expenses.  
 
In determining the factors that affect and contribute to efficient budget allocation, the researcher first determined the 
target learning outcomes of the Senior High School academic programs. This was done to make sure that the 
mathematical model for the budget allocation are focused on the learning outcomes. To quantify the learning 
outcomes, the researcher followed the Analytical Hierarchy Process. The data used in the AHP was from a survey for 
the SHS teachers. Through AHP and by using the Expert Choice software, the researchers computed for the 
prioritization weights of each learning outcome. These prioritization weights were compared to the DepEd priority 
weights, which was derived from the number of hours spent for every learning outcomes. Upon determining the 
751","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

learning outcomes and its prioritization weights, the achieved ratio for each strand and each school was calculated 
through estimation and validation on the expenses incurred, and were incurred for each strand, specifically on 
electricity expenses and materials expenses because both expenses are contributory to most of the expenses incurred 
by the schools.  
 
Furthermore, using the estimated expenses from the sample schools, the standard amount of expense per student and 
per class for the most contributory expenses to the actual expenses were computed. The minimum expenses required 
and the available budget serve as the right-hand side for the mathematical model. Using the standardized minimum 
expenses, the budget available, and the learning outcomes’ priority weights, a mathematical model was formulated. 
The mathematical model is a goal programming model to reach a compromise between all the available constraints.  
 
The indicator of the effect of mathematical model are reflected in the achievement of learning outcomes. The result 
of the mathematical model showed an average increase of 24.76% for the schools using the DepEd priority weights. 
To allow the schools to utilize the mathematical model at different states/school years, the researcher designed a 
program that will generate the detailed budget allocation.

Abstract 
 
The manufacturing industry has a high potential of being exposed to continuous market changes that need 
to adapt successfully to a rapidly changing market environment. Therefore, the ability to cope with these 
factors is vital. Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS) have a cost-effective response to rapid 
changes, as well as have the capability to cope with market changes (due to the variation in customer and 
supplier behaviors) by adapting to various manufacturing systems. In this paper the authors present a 
method to assess and choose the appropriate manufacturing design layout. Three different configurations 
have been designed using the CAD program SOLIDWORKS; the configurations were compared using 
ARENA 14.7 simulation software to simulate the process of manufacturing a product. The configurations 
were then evaluated using various performance measures, including resource utilization, waiting time and 
throughput. The evaluation was used to identify the appropriate configuration design. The results show that 
the proposed methodology can offer a suitable configuration that can achieve high performance as well as 
adapt to market changes.

1. Introduction 
Manufacturing companies are often subjected to different factors that can impart rapid changes to their manufacturing 
systems. Therefore, the ability to cope with these factors is vital. Such companies should possess manufacturing 
facilities that can respond quickly and in a cost-effective manner to market changes. Reconfigurable Manufacturing 
Systems (RMS), whose components include reconfigurable machines and reconfigurable controllers, as well as 
methodologies for their systematic design and rapid ramp-up, are the foundations of this new manufacturing paradigm 
(Koren et al., 1999). 
A Reconfigurable Manufacturing System has the high capability of adapting to rapid or un-predictable market changes 
in a cost-effective way. RMS can integrate the features of the two types of manufacturing systems, Dedicated 
Manufacturing Systems (DMS) and Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS), thereby achieving high productivity, a 
changeable system structure, and a medium cost (Koren et al., 2006). 
In the next sub-sections, the authors first discuss some recent research relevant to advances, designs, and evaluation 
of various types of manufacturing systems. This is followed by problem statement and highlight of the RMS problem 
that has been addressed by the authors in this manuscript. 
1.1 Background 
Koren (2010) demonstrated that products have a life cycle. When the life cycle is over, a new product appears which, 
consequently, requires a new manufacturing system. A new manufacturing system requires a high initial investment 
cost. Therefore, the implementation of a new manufacturing system for each product is usually not an effective

Table 5 points out that the U-shape has the highest throughput, least amount of time in the system, and the highest 
resource utilization rate. Although it also has the highest queue length and waiting time, it still remains favorable as 
throughput and utilization rates are considered primary factors. 
5. Conclusion  
Designing a manufacturing system that can cope with changes rapidly and precisely is a major objective for 
companies.  
This paper presents a methodology to identify a manufacturing system that can handle different changes in the market 
environment. The evaluation and identification process mainly consists of a simulation model that can provide 
different performance measures that enable choosing a suitable configuration. 
A methodology was developed here to find a manufacturing system aimed at coping with changes in a precise manner 
as well achieving high performance. Three configuration designs were used as alternatives to determine which 
configuration was most suitable using the developed methodology.  
The three configurations were evaluated via ARENA simulation software. Several types of data were collected 
regarding the product and configurations. The collected data were used to evaluate the performance of each 
configuration and consequently choosing the most suitable configuration.

Abstract 
This study investigates the musculoskeletal problems in four craft sectors in the Jaipur, India, namely carpet washing, 
trimming, alignment and wood carving. A field study was conducted in 13 workshops of several handicraft 
manufacturers, and 122 male respondents were randomly selected for the survey. The data about pain occurrence at 
different body and hand regions among the participants were collected using a questionnaire. Mean perceived exertion 
among the handicraft workers during respective craft tasks was estimated according to Borg’s rated perceived exertion 
(RPE) scale The highest prevalence of symptoms in the body regions was reported for the last 12 months were the 
Wrist, Lower back, Shoulders. Whereas, metacarpal, thenar eminence, and hypothenar were the most prominent hand 
regions of discomfort. These discomfort regions could be due to the poor workstation and hand tool design, and 
awkward working postures. Furthermore, the study revealed that the mean scores of the RPE were significantly higher 
with higher age and experience. It can be postulated that the work system including hand tools should be redesigned 
that may reduce the symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders. Health habits also play a role in RPE, albeit to a moderate 
degree.

1. Introduction
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the most common problem among the workers employed in the handicraft 
industry which are related to injuries of the muscles, nerves, tendons, joints, cartilage, and supporting structures of 
the upper and lower limbs, neck, and lower back (Salve, 2015). These disorders are caused by the sudden exertion or 
prolonged exposure to physical factors such as repetition, force, vibration, noise, or awkward posture (Bernard, 
1997; Singh et al., in press; Singh et al., 2018a). This study investigates the problems encountered during 
handcrafting work and proposes solutions to mitigate the risks due to the physical factors involved in these craft 
tasks. This study assesses the ergonomic aspects at the grass-root level and proposing the insight to develop a better 
design.   
The handicraft manufacturing processes may be dynamic, repetitive or sedentary (Singh et al., 2018b). The craft 
workers may require prolonged repetitive, awkward postures. Handicraft work is much more difficult and extremely 
labour intensive as compared to other informal jobs (Singh et al., washing). Several available literature reports that 
there are risk factors are present, for developing the cumulative trauma disorders, at the workplace of handicraft 
manufacturing (Singh et al., 2018c; Das et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018b). 
In countries like India, informal sectors are the primary source of new employment and the occupational 
problems among workers in these sectors need more focus. The prevalence of various MSDs was not evident in 
literature for the workers engaged in the targeted handicraft workers in the present study. Therefore, it sought useful 
to take up the issues of the ergonomic study of handicraft operatives, with an objective to determine the prevalence 
of MSDs while crafting work.  This study hypothesizes that there would be significant association of age, experience 
and health habits on perceived exertion. The research aimed to propose certain workstation guidelines which could

4. Conclusion 
Overall, it can be concluded that there was risk of discomfort in different body and hand regions among the handicraft 
workers. The findings in this study can lead to the need for attention as well as investigation of current hand tools and 
workstation, leading improvement in working posture and efficiency of the worker. The other major contributions of 
the paper was proposing the effect of age, experience and health habits on rated perceived exertion on the workers 
engaged in craft activities. It must be borne in mind that this study was only conducted on a small exposed group of 
workers. The future work includes to design/redesign the hand tool interventions focusing on the inferences drawn 
from this study.

Abstract 
Healthcare Industry is one of the most important sectors nowadays, which providing goods and services to patients 
with curative, preventive, rehabilitative, and palliative care. There are patients flow, medicine flow, material flow and 
information flow in this supply chain. Patients service level and cost expense increasing are important issues to take 
into consideration. Outpatient department is the main department requires more attention in term of patient logistics 
activity and process management. Based on this, the study focuses on patient logistics activity and cost analysis of 
each activity in a clinic in the outpatient department of the case study hospital. The crucial purpose is to analyze 
activity, determine resource use, estimate time processing in each activity, and calculate the unit cost of each patient 
activity in an outpatient clinic. Time Driven Activity Based Costing is used as a solution tool. The results might serve 
the clinic administrator for cost controlling system and process management and obtain a guideline for choosing the 
appropriated costing system for the hospital.

1. Introduction
Healthcare cost has increased dramatically due to the aging population and more sophisticated treatment. Forty-two 
percent of total spending in the hospital is logistics cost (Henning, 1980). Healthcare cost in the United States reaches 
$4.8 trillion by 2021 according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid service. Furthermore, logistics cost leads to 
significant increasing healthcare cost. Meanwhile, all patients expect to get high-quality care with lower cost (Abel-
smith & Mossialos 1994, Salman & Figueras 1997). In addition, poor collaboration and information sharing, lack of 
knowledge exchanging of healthcare supply chain, standard data limitation, insufficient of IT integration between 
hospital and its supplier lead to increase cost in healthcare supply chain, poor good quality, the dissatisfaction of 
client inpatient logistics. 
Therefore, more researcher and healthcare organization focus on this issue. Recently, the healthcare industry has 
started to invest in more appropriated cost system management. The study of Stapleton et al. (2004), shown 
that Activities based costing (ABC) is considered as a tool to determine the real cost of marketing and logistics

4.3.2.2. Total cost of patient activity with Special treatment 
 
In this case, the patient needs to do the further process to Special treatment as the doctor recommends after using 
medicine clinic service. The results of this study indicate that the total cost of this service (349.10 baht) is the larger 
proportion than the total cost of patient activity without Special treatment (508.00 baht). Because of one more activity 
need to be added, so service time increase and lead to more resource cost are consumed. The result of this patient 
service show the similar result with the patient activity without special treatment. The biggest proportion is the 
building cost which consume 30.57% of total cost. The second and third portion are the office and household material 
cost and the equipment cost which take 16.22% and 14.81% of the total cost, respectively. 
 
To summarize of comparison between these two patient activities, the results imply that the timing and resource are 
directly proportional.   
 
4.3.2.3. Activity cost of outpatient medicine clinics in the hospital 
 
The result in the study indicated that meeting doctor activity, Special treatment and check document activity was the 
first, second and third highest costing activity, which was consumed 44.16%, 31.28% and 20.05% of the total cost 
respectively. The fourth costing activities are recorded vital sign activity which consumed 2.00% of total cost. And 
the last one is looking up appointment card and measure body weight activity was consumed 1.50% and 1.00% of 
total cost respectively. 
 
4.4. Research benefit and Limitation 
 
In this study, the TDABC information can help the department head and healthcare manger’s understanding of the 
difference clinic activity and the resource cost of each clinic activity. As such, the clinic management can determine 
the strategic change that increased the value and effectiveness of the current and future outpatient clinic. This study 
model is appropriated for further studies in the hospital or another industry that never use Time driven activities based 
costing system. Time-driven activities based costing in this study does not only impact to the cost but also include 
performance measurement. Activity time, activity cost and performance data provide information for hospital 
management to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of service, facilitating elimination of non-value added 
activities and improve service. 
 
Even though this study model has more advantage, but it still faces limitation. This study focus only in one OPD 
clinics in the hospital. Some data need to be estimated from the total cost of hospital, so the resource cost cannot be 
estimated for specific location of activity. Some resource data lost track of record. Moreover, time data can be 
estimated by observe clinic only one week.  One more, this study can analyze only the front activity which process 
directly with the patient and back activity is exclude from the study as the author cannot observe the time data of this 
activity and it take time. The waiting time and non-value-added activity are excluded from this study. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
As the growth of the healthcare industry and more competition in the healthcare environment, the hospital needs to 
develop the efficient costing system to provide financial feedback. Time Driven Activity-based costing become the 
alternative tool for administrators to use for efficiency non-human resource and human resource management and to 
improve service quality. In this research, we try to explain the Time driven Activity-based costing development in an 
OPD clinic in the hospital. The TDABC seem to be faster model adaptability in the real world operates. In this study, 
it was found that medicine clinic in the hospital was identified into 6 activities such as body weight, look up 
appointment card, record vital sign, meet with the doctor in the treatment room, check document after meeting with 
the doctor and need to further to Special treatment. The activity was classified in two 2 groups of patient, the first 
group was called “Without Special treatment” that no need to further to treatment after meeting with the doctor in the 
clinic and the second group was called ""With Special treatment "" which the patient needs to further to treatment. Based 
on the result of table 4 and 5, the unit cost for the patient without procedure and patient with the procedure range from 
3.96 to 155.28 baht/year/patient. The total cost of patient activity without procedure and with procedure are 349.10 
baht/year/patient and 508.00 baht/year/patient respectively. It shows the influence of usage of activity, the resource 
used and time increasing between these two service cost. These result indicated that administrator should concern with

the real cost driver such as material cost, especially, the time spent in each activity which is the cost driver for resource 
cost and the activity which consumed the highest cost. In this study, the TDABC information clearly improved the 
department head and healthcare manger’s understanding of the difference clinic activity. As such, the clinic 
management can determine the strategic change that increased the value and effectiveness of the current and future 
outpatient clinic.

Abstract  
 
We try to solve a flow-captured location-allocation problem for signboard layout using a genetic algorithm. 
A facility located at a node of a road network captures the traffic flow passing the node. In this problem, the traffic 
is assumed to represent demand. The flow-capturing location-allocation model responds to this type of demand and 
seeks to maximize the one-time exposure of this traffic to facilities. The signboard layout problem is classified as an 
instance of this problem. Kakimoto et al. solved this type of problem using an integer programming approach in the 
case of charging facilities for electric vehicles in Bangkok, Thailand. They reported that the location problem cannot 
be solved if there is a large number of facilities. On the other hand, Hodgson et al. compared the performance of 
exact, vertex substitution and greedy solution procedures. They found that a greedy approach can solve the problem 
for a large number of facilities. However, the difference between the optimal solution and the greedy solution 
becomes larger as the number of facilities increases. 
 
In this research, we study the possibility of solving the signboard layout problem using a genetic algorithm. 
This algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm that can solve large combinatorial optimization problems. We formulate 
a mathematical model for the problem based on multi-objective optimization, where one objective function 
minimizes the number of signboards and the other maximizes the traffic flow captured by the signboards. We 
present the design of the genes, that is, the bit strings that express a solution to the problem. Finally, we evaluate the 
performance using numerical simulation.

Abstract 
This paper is focused on application of value stream mapping in a production floor of a furniture industry with a view 
to enhance its performance. Analysis of cost is implicated with the value stream maps to secure economic justification. 
The data was collected from the production floor to develop the current state map from where the non-value added 
activities and other sources of wastes were investigated and areas of improvements were identified to minimize or 
eliminate them. Incorporating the improvements proposed, this paper suggests a future state map for the upholstery 
section as well as analysis and result obtained from the application of value stream mapping. The comparative analysis 
of current and future state map suggests that adapting the concept of Lean can repose momentous contribution in the 
industry by reducing production lead time by 66.67% while lessening the cost by 11.25%. This paper highlights the 
monetary impact of adaptation of value stream mapping by showing that incorporating Lean concept with the 
utilization of value stream mapping can help industries to provide high customer response with lower costs which is 
vital to enhance competitive performance in existent market situation.

1. Introduction
One of the ever-incrementing challenges that industries face today’s world is to maintain good customer response 
along with minimization of cost, reduction of inventory and ensuring quality to survive in the competitive market in 
worldwide scale. To enhance organizational and competitive performance, diverse kinds of improvement techniques 
and methodologies are accommodated by organizations. Concept of Lean Manufacturing is one of the approaches that 
has been popular among manufacturing and construction facilities assisting to reach organizational goals. In 1990, 
Womack et al. popularized the philosophy of Lean thinking in the book named ‘The machine that changed the world: 
The story of lean production’ as an effective means of eliminating wastes. Lean is the most potent tool to maximize 
customer value though the elimination of wastes taking place in many forms at any place at any time in the organization 
(Kumar, 2016; Lacerda et al., 2016). 
Value stream mapping (VSM) is one of the most exigent tools for adaptation and maintenance of Lean in any industry. 
It is a simple pencil and paper representation which provides with an ample view of production flow from upstream 
to downstream establishing a relationship between both information and material drift. VSM is a process mapping 
approach that uses dedicated icons to visualize the process clearly and identifies the areas of improvement by reduction 
or elimination of process wastes. The fundamentals to implement value stream mapping are to draw a current state 
map portraying the existing process, find possible changes and uplifts and develop action plan to reach a future state 
map incorporating the continuous improvement (Forno et al., 2014).  
Most of the companies can’t realize the monetary aspect of adopting Lean because conventional costing systems are 
not concerned with the aspects of Lean Manufacturing principles and independent of production time. As production 
cost primarily depends on the speed of product flow through the value stream, value stream mapping can be useful as 
an effective tool to bridge between operational and economic organizational views. (Ramadan et al., 2017). So, if 
value stream mapping can be integrated with cost calculation, the economic feasibility and financial impact of Lean

by 11.25%. The comparison between cost of current and future state map is further portrayed in figure 10 for more 
clarification. 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Comparison of costs between current and future state maps 
 
Under the light of analysis and discussion stated here, application of Lean but the utilization of value stream mapping 
can be an effective approach for the industry to reduce production lead time, production cost and to minimize wastes 
that will contribute to enhance its competitive performance and achieve organizational goals. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Value stream mapping is an effective Lean tool that helps in the visualization of process under study to address the 
wastes and areas of improvements to pave the way of attainment of continuous flow from upstream to downstream of  
production resulting in reduced inventory, production cost and increased efficiency. To provide the industry under 
study with the favors of this Lean tool, this research attempts to utilize cost based value stream mapping in a real life 
case of the existing upholstery section of a furniture study and suggestions were proposed to improve process 
shortcomings. The execution of suggested improvements in the future state map is anticipated to result in 28.69% 
increase in Process Cycle Efficiency, 24.8% increase in total value added time, 60% decrease in non-value added time 
and 66.67% decrease in production lead time. In addition to that Cost based analysis is integrated which shows that 
implementation of future state map will result in 11.25% reduction in total cost on weekly basis. This attempt 
ascertains the economic viability of the proposed future state map. All these outcomes justifies the efficiency of value 
stream mapping in collaboration with cost implication in increasing customer response while also offering quality 
products to customers in relatively low price which enhance performance in competitive market environment.  
 
The contribution of this research lies in the justification of financial feasibility of applying value stream mapping tool 
and incorporating suggested improvements following a systematic framework. The shortcoming of this research is the 
future state map is based on anticipation rather than application in real life situation. Moreover, in future state map, it 
was assumed that the employees are willing to adapt Lean and human factors in production were not considered. Some 
of the cost related data couldn’t be collected accurately and were approximated due to industry policies and 
regulations. To overcome this limitations, further work can be done in this field by applying the suggested 
improvements in reality and incorporating simulation for evaluation. Additional focus can be laid on the implications 
of ergonomics and environmental factors in value stream mapping for better and more advanced outcome.

Abstract 
The main aim of this study is to offers such a cross platform web interface which will let anybody to access the 
detail contact of potential blood donors around the required location. An algorithm has been developed to identify 
the potential blood donors. A website has also been created using this algorithm in the backend using HTML5, PHP 
and JAVA programming languages. XAMMP software was used in hosting local server. Several automated blood 
management system are available like the Facebook blood donation, but none of them offer any efficient algorithm 
considering the variables like frequency of blood donation, last date of donation, gender and age factor. To find the 
eligible donors we have considered all factors simultaneously, which makes the study unique. Practically this search 
engine will be helpful for the automated blood donation organizations and other blood bank for identifying the 
potential blood donors from their large database.

1. Introduction
Blood is a necessary element in human body. Without blood human body is incomplete. According to the scientist 
about 7 to 8 percent of human weight is comprised of blood (Sissons, 2018). In conventional way blood is donated 
via blood donation organizations or blood bank. Blood bank is observed as an area wherever blood is gathered as 
a results of the activity of blood donation by donors that is stored and preserved (maximum twenty eight days) for 
later transfusion.  Most of the blood banks in Bangladesh don’t support online blood donors database. In countries 
like Bangladesh blood a huge amount of units of blood is donated on average every year. According to statistical 
study in the year 2011 about five-lakh unit of blood was recorded as donated in Bangladesh the value of which 
increased to seven lakh in following five years (Molla, 2017). It is a clear sign that blood donors are on the rise 
along with the increase of population. Due to this huge amount of data of donors an automated and efficient way of 
data management is to be introduced for which online platform of blood donation can become a pavestone. Besides 
blood management problem occurs due to traditional techniques of data entry by manual operators where there is a 
risk of data to be outdated and data retrieval process is also hampered due to it. Owing to solve all the issues the 
study is done on an automated blood bank. Besides in present traditional ways the factors like gender, age, last date 
of blood donation, frequency of blood donation per year are not recorded which is given vital importance in this

6. Conclusion 
This study has developed an online platform which has made the blood receivers to connect with donors at the place 
of requirement. Due to use of gender of donors as recruitment parameters the male and female donors can maintain 
their respective duration of successive blood donation. Age parameter lets receivers get more potential donors within 
the range of blood donation criteria. Due to use of sorting program the more potential donors are listed in top rows 
of the result table which aids in selection of blood donors by receivers. 
 
6.1 Practical Implementation 
Practically this search engine will be helpful for the automated blood donation organizations and other blood bank 
for identifying the potential blood donors from their large database. 
 
6.2 Limitation 
Some of the information of the donors frequently change. For example address of the donor and last date of blood 
donation need always to be updated manually by the account holder. This two information are a major limitation of 
our study.

6.3 Future Research Scopes 
The address of donors can be made updated automatically from the external device. GPS technology can be used in 
this purpose.

Abstract 
The need to improve the quality of transportation for persons with mobility impairment and persons with 
special needs is a concern, which needs attention. Public trains are highly used mode of transportation in 
the Philippines. According to the 2003-2012 transportation statistics, the Light Rail Transit (LRT) 
transports over 170 million people, of which the train carts are designed only for passengers in healthy state, 
defying the benefits of public transportation particularly for persons with special needs (PSN) such as 
physically disabled, senior citizens, pregnant women, and passengers with babies or children. The PSN 
represents more than 1.57 percent of LRT’s passenger population. Previous researches have focused on the 
design of public transport for the general public and only a limited amount of research had focused on the 
design of public transport for persons with special needs. That being so, the researchers aimed to 
ergonomically design the LRT carts for persons with mobility impairment or special needs such as disabled, 
elderly, persons carrying children and pregnant women that is fit for use for Filipino commuters. The study 
covered and mainly focused on designing LRT carts including door, seats, aisles, handrails and other 
features that require mobility aid such as wheelchairs, crutches and canes. In the ergonomic design of LRT 
carts, factors such as safety, accessibility and comfortability of passengers were considered. The researchers 
have conducted review of related literature, direct observation, surveys, actual measurements and statistical 
analyses in order to describe factually and accurately the current design of train carts in the Philippines. 
And through application of ergonomic principles and anthropometry, the researchers have improved the 
current design of LRT carts with the consideration of the issues of the commuters with mobility impairment 
and special needs.

I. Introduction
Public transportation improves quality of life in communities across the country by providing safe, efficient, and 
economical service. Not only does public transit benefit the people who use it, it also benefits society as a whole 
(Public Transportation Fact Book, 2008). The public transport system of the Philippines consists of roads, water, air 
and rail transport; and the Light Rail Transit (LRT) is one of the railway systems in the country. The line is operated 
by the LRT Authority that carries about 579,000 passengers each day (National Statistics Coordination Board, 2009). 
The rail transport system enhances personal opportunities, saves money, foster livable communities, provides 
economic opportunities, creates community benefits and offers mobility for seniors and mobility impaired persons 
(Benefits of Public Transportation, 2009).  
Mobility impairment is a condition which prevents a person from performing physical or mental functions that a 
normal person can do. This can be caused by a number of factors such as disease, accident, congenital disorder and 
other needs such as the elderly, persons carrying children and pregnant women. These are called persons with special

4. Conclusion  
The findings of the study have proven that the existing design of train carts in the Philippines is not ergonomically 
designed and fit for Filipino commuters with special needs. This was proven on the result of the RULA and NMDQ 
analysis of the researchers. The result revealed that users experienced pain and discomfort in different body parts in 
riding the LRT, which justified the need to redesign and improve current train carts. In the design of train carts, 
accessibility, comfortability and safety of users were taken into consideration based on the need and requirements of 
users obtained from Importance-Satisfaction Gap Analysis and Quality Function Deployment. And finally, by 
applying the principles of anthropometry, the researchers were able to come up with a proposed design of train carts 
for persons with special needs such as disabled, elderly, person with children and pregnant. The proposed design aims 
to cater and support the needs of users with mobility impairment in order to achieve comfort and safety when riding 
the LRT trains in the Philippines.

Abstract 
This paper investigates distribution strategies when facing disruption. This strategy is based on the flexibility in 
transportation planning through the use of multimodal transportation. The flexibility mode of transportation mode will 
make it easier to re-plan routes when the system is affected by disruption but usually needs a higher total cost. The 
development of this model is based on the determining of the delivery route that results in the least total cost and time. 
The calculation result is intended to compare modes used in either single mode or modal combination in terms of cost 
and time used.

1. Introduction
In a transportation system, the types of disruptions include natural disaster, transportation infrastructure breakdown, 
accidents, congestion, bridge breakdown, etc. some disruptions are kind a rare event but have a large impact in 
systems, for example, the economic impact that affected the transportation facilities users. Ishfaq (2012) provides an 
example of the impact of transportation disruption which includes; the earthquake in California which caused 
enormous financial losses in the business sector due to damaged transportation facilities. Beside that, Wilson (2007) 
in Ishfaq (2012) writes that countries in the Pacific Rim are also affected by the supply chain of electronic and 
automotive products from earthquakes and tsunamis. In addition, Indonesia has a high various transportation 
disruption with more risk variety; congestion, accidents, natural disaster, extreme weather, etc. Apart from that 
disruptions, natural disasters are the highest potential disruptions accidents due to Indonesia's geographical position 
which located on the bound of the active Eurasian and Australian plates. 
The impact of transportation disruption is demand cannot be fulfilled according to the agreement and the total cost 
tended to increase. When disruptions occur in the transportation network, one of best strategy is to determine 
alternative routes and mitigate the negative impacts of these disruptions to maintain logistical performance. Research 
on transportation disruption developed from 1990 to the present (Burgholzer et al., 2013a). The development of the 
research is to follow the developed research on transportation models, ranging from unimodal transportation to 
multimodal transportation. Some paper that considers disruptions in single mode includes; Narayanaswami and 
Rangaraj (2013); Gedik et al. (2014); Zilko et al., (2016) and Uddin et al, (2017) analyzed in rail network, Liu et al., 
(2016), Di et al., (2013) and Wong et al., (2015) investigated in ship network and Udenta et al., (2013) studied in road

5. Conclusion 
This paper discusses the logistics strategy (routing) that should be taken when disruption occurs. The utilization of 
modal flexibility will have an impact on the total time produced longer than those using only one mode because there 
are several additional processes in it. However, the costs incurred are more minimal. Moreover, when there is 
disruption on the highway lane, there is a possibility that the total costs incurred are also higher. So in this case, when 
there is a disruption in the highway, a multimodal strategy is the best strategy that produces the most minimal total 
costs. But when the decision maker in making a decision is based on the total time needed for the delivery process, 
the unimodal strategy still results in a lower total time compared to the multimodal.

Abstract 
The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry in Asia remains to be optimistic in the past years. This is evident 
in the Philippines since the industry is hitting big due to its huge potential workforce that it caters. A large percentage 
of BPO workers are into telemarketing or call center sub-sector. The total number of persons employed in BPO 
industry was estimated at 576,000 of which nearly seven out of eight employees (88%) works in the call center 
subsector. Due to increasing demand of call center agents in the country, the reported occupational risks of agents are 
also apparent. According to recent data from PSA (2015), The BPO industry registered a total of 257 cases of 
occupational injuries. Most of the affected workers were employed in call centers (86.4% or 222 cases). Call center 
agents encounter daily stressors from work. Researches have shown that call center employees work in a distracting 
environment. They face high customer expectations and experience pressure to meet company standards. Thus, they 
experience stress as a result of the conflicting demands of the company, managers, co-workers, and customers (Ruyter, 
K., Wetzels, M., and Feinberg, R., 2001). Occupational risk factors have major effect on the stress level of workers. 
These risk factors affect the health, psychological and job performance of call centers agents. Previous researchers on 
occupational risk factors studied the effects of stress to job performance. However, the effect of occupational risk 
factors to the stress level based on the coping mechanism and work shift of agents were not yet considered in the 
study. Thus, this paper intends to identify significant risk factors affecting the agents’ overall performance in terms 
of health condition, psychological condition and job performance and measure the risk level associated with 
occupational stress of call center agents based on their coping mechanism and work shift. Data were gathered from 
180 inbound call center agents who work in 3 shifts (opening, middle and closing). Results showed that for opening 
and closing shifts, occupational risk factors affecting the stress level of agents are irregular meal times, noise level, 
workplace temperature, workplace setup and social life disruption; while for middle shift, risk factors are workplace 
relationships, number of rest days, irregular mealtimes, social life disruptions and domestic life disruptions. Therefore, 
the identified risk factors affecting stress would serve as the basis for organizations in call center industry to develop 
stress management programs that would help improve call center agents’ overall performance and wellbeing.

1. Introduction
The call center industry is one of the biggest and fastest growing industries not only in the Philippines, but also, all 
over the world. As a sub-sector of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, call centers in the Philippines 
remain as a major contributor of the country’s economy. Call centers began in the Philippines as providers of email 
response and managing services that broadened to industrial capabilities for almost all types of customer relations. 
The calls managed by a number of Philippine call centers can be categorized into one of two types: outbound calls 
and inbound calls. Outbound calls include advisories, sales verification, customer services, surveys, collections and 
telemarketing. Inbound calls include account inquiries, verification, technical support, sales and various customer 
services. (Wikipedia contributors. 2018, April 3).

On the other hand, Clusters 1 and 3 ranked irregular mealtimes, noise level, social disruption, physical setup, and 
shift rotations as the top 5 risks on job performance.  Also, Cluster 2 ranked social life disruption, performance 
demand, irregular mealtimes, irregular sleep, and workplace relationships as the top 5 risks on job performance.   
  
4. Conclusion   
   
From the result of the analysis in the data obtained from 180 respondents of the study, the following conclusions were 
drawn:  
(1) Using regression analysis, it was determined that significant risk factors associated with occupational stress 
of call center agents were shift rotation, number of rest days, social life disruption, domestic life disruption, 
irregular sleep, performance demand, irregular mealtimes, workplace relationships, noise level, workplace 
temperature, and physical setup. While gender and lighting condition were both found to be insignificant 
causes of stress.  
(2) The significant risk factors identified using regression analysis were further treated and analyzed in order to 
determine the effects of significant risk factors to the consequence of stress. Based on the result of correlation 
analysis, only physical health, mental health, anxiety and poor average handling time (AHT) were considered 
as the true consequence of stress.   
(3) Cluster analyses, both K-means and joining clustering were done in order to determine if work shifts differ 
in terms of significant risk factors affecting health, psychological condition and job performance of call 
center agents. There were three clusters considered in the study: cluster 1 is composed of the closing shift 
(3:30am-12:30pm); cluster 2 is composed of the middle shift (10:00pm-7:00am) and cluster 3 is composed 
of the opening shift (8:00pm-5:00am). Based on the results of K-means Clustering, it was found out that in 
each of the shifts, the occupational risk factors contributing to stress level of call center agents and the 
consequence of stress differ.   
(4) Based on the overall risk level calculation, the risk factors resulting to stress based on coping mechanism of 
call center agents in each work shift are as follows: (a) closing shift: shift rotation, social life disruption, 
domestic life disruption, irregular sleep, performance demand, irregular mealtimes, workplace relationships, 
noise level, and physical setup (b) for middle shift: number of rest days, shift rotation, social life disruption, 
domestic life disruption, irregular sleep, performance demand, irregular mealtimes, workplace relationships, 
noise level, and physical setup; and (c) opening shift: number of rest days, shift rotation, social life disruption, 
irregular sleep, performance demand, irregular mealtimes, workplace relationships, noise level, and physical 
setup.   
(5) In order to determine whether the risk levels calculated per cluster or work shift is significantly different, 
one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Test were employed. Based on the result, cluster 1 (closing) and cluster 3 
(opening) were not significantly different, however, both are significantly different from cluster 2 (middle). 
The risk levels of each cluster were then ranked in order to determine the occupational risk factors affecting 
the stress level of call center agents. The results indicated that for cluster 1 (closing) and 3 (opening) shifts, 
top 5 risk factors affecting stress are irregular meal times, noise level, workplace temperature, workplace 
setup and social life disruption. For cluster 2 (middle) shift, top 5 risk factors are workplace relationships, 
number of rest days, irregular mealtimes, social life disruptions and domestic life disruptions. Therefore, the 
identified risk factors affecting stress would serve as the basis for organizations in call center industry to 
develop stress management programs that would help improve call center agents’ overall performance and 
wellbeing.

maximum of what a factory is able to produce and commit to customers will be constrained by the factory bottleneck. 
It is highly sensitive for capacity calculation, investment decision and customer commits. Accurate machine 
performance measured using OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is important. In this project, we will discuss 
how we apply the OEE measurement at the one of our backend factories at Melaka, Malaysia in the molding area. 
Through the OEE reporting, the performance is not meeting the plan in the key elements of invalid data and speed 
loss. In order to address this gap, an effective method by using DMAIC problem solving methodology is required to 
classify the accuracy of each element and recommend the attention to the focus problem area. In this paper, OEE 
improvement systematics will be discussed and sharing of implemented results in the project with total of 510EuroK 
investment avoidance has been achieved.  
Keywords 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness, Process Performance, Time Deviation, Equipment Monitoring, Productivity 
Introduction 
As our business grows, OEE has become increasingly important for measuring actual molding machine performance 
versus target. Any deviation may have an impact on the customer deliveries and result incapacity fulfillment issues 
and poor investment decisions. 
The challenge for the project is not merely on identifying the losses of machine performance but also to understand 
the machine utilization in capacity planning system used by planner, the plan database that industrial enginner used to 
maintain the plan uph after time study conducted, and the OEE report monitoring that is linked with throughput signal 
and configuration collection from the machine. These three important aspects helps equipment, industrial engineer 
and planner can focus on the real OEE loses with the accurate OEE, gap closure so that the team can make a right 
decision on investmenet avoidance.

With this project, the team is able to achieve two important outcome:  
 
1) Standardized the equipment signal system (tapping location, and 0 delay) for unscheduled down scenario by 
benchmarking the golden setup.  
2) Perform early triggering with any abnormal deviation observed in the OEE report  
 
This gives the factory and operation the confidence that the equipment is under perfect synchronization following 
standard machine setup governance, realistic capacity planning and accurate actual performance measurement. This 
help the team to achieve the right decision on investiment avoidance of 510K Euro.  
 
Conclusion 
 
This Synchronization Systematic allows various functional departments of Industrial Engineers, Equipment 
Engineers, Planners and Operation to align better alignment on equipment performance and capacity commitment 
following the agreed standard systematic.

Abstract 
Since the published report of the Industry 4.0 in 2013 by the German National Academy of Science and Engineering, 
comprehensive researches and developments was provoked in both academia and industry professionals. Researchers 
tried to conduct exploratory studies of its unforeseen phenomena and practitioners tried to optimize its applications to 
gain competitive advantages. Along with buzzwords terminologies such as, cloud manufacturing, Internet of Things, 
cyber-physical systems, augmented reality and artificial intelligence, along with highly anticipated concepts such as 
SMART factory, SMART manufacturing, SMART warehousing and SMART production, the SMART supply chain 
was introduced. However, for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the concept of SMART supply chain is often 
abstractive and disruptive in nature. Therefore, in this paper, a SSCM implementation model as a conceptual 
framework in identifying the transitional phases and requirements of SSCM for SMEs was presented. Three 
transitional phases have been introduced to clarify the adaptation stages for SMEs and its practical implications. 
Finally, several key benefits of SSCM have been highlighted in this paper, which offers new opportunities for SMEs 
to compete in the global market and for future research directions.

© IEOM Society International",,"In light of this research, the contribution of this study is geared towards firms in realizing the benefits of adaptations 
to gain competitive edges. Due to the nature of SMEs, especially family enterprises, lack of appropriate corporate 
governance structure, inconsistency of decisions and business transfers may result in poor management practices. 
However, it has been proven that the recognition of IoT and CPS technologies allow firms to offer customers products 
with superior quality and competitive in price (Brettel et al. 2014). Therefore, realization of SSCM practices would 
enable SMEs to gain a better understanding of processes within the firm, the need of their customers and the overall 
business environment (Ivanov 2016; Wang et al. 2016; OECD 2017). Under the context of academic research, we 
have contributed to the emerging field of I4.0, supply chain management and SMEs and its supply chain relationships. 
Along with the highlighted phases of implementation, deliberation of new supply chain models is possible along with 
new introduction to digital value-chain. We have also conceptualized three distinct transitional phases of SSCM along 
with the relationship of their individual enablers. While there is voluminous research literature available on SCM, 
only a hand full of research indicates the applications of SSCM to SMEs. To consolidate the discussion threads, new 
possible research directions such as; IoT data analytics for SMEs, development of SSCM for SMEs, economic value 
of SSCM applications for SMEs and SSCM practices for SMEs is worth future investigations.  
 
7. Future Research Suggestions 
This paper is informative in nature. It is worth noting that only a handful of literature, mostly conference articles, are 
published over the past 5 years since the introduction of I4.0. However, the very prediction of I4.0 has created unique 
opportunities for researchers to investigate the endless possibilities of supply chain practices and its impact on the 
business environment. The SSCM implementation model offers a stringent perspective on the adopting of new 
information technologies, which could be recognized in a portion of the analyzed literature. Newly articulated 
dimensions of supply chain management would require innovative integration of different expertise and new business 
development strategies. The main implications for future research include a need for more work in theoretical issues 
of SSCM for SMEs and empirical research, such as case studies, to provide practical insights. Furthermore, it will be 
interesting to systematically compare the transitional phases and the situational enablers of SMEs in different 
industries or countries.  Nevertheless, there is still a strong demand for future SSCM research activities in the context 
of SMEs.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 also known as the “fourth industrial revolution” will positively affect not only manufacturing processes 
but also the connected supply chains. Through digitization, important control information, even at an inter-company 
level, will become available in real-time leading to great efficiency increases. However, the increasing trend of mass 
customization as well as supply chains that are spread globally over the world pone specific challenges to SMEs 
logistics to deliver products Just-in-Time (JIT), with low costs and the right quality. Moreover, up to now mostly big 
companies are boosting research and development in this field letting on the track small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs). In this paper, we present the outcomes of expert workshops to identify requirements of SMEs in 
the field of smart logistics management. To give a global perspective, SMEs from Central Europe, the Northern part 
of the United States of America as well as from Northern Thailand are presented. The paper presents an explorative 
set of hypothesis for requirements as well as the outline of a survey for their further validation. It summarizes the 
results of the first phase within the European research project “SME 4.0 - Industry 4.0 for SMEs”.

Abstract 
The Urban Public Transport (UPT) is an essential service in view of its socio-economic effects and therefore 
ensuring efficient and effective delivery is a priority for most governments at both the local and national 
levels. The Moroccan UPT sector has a range of organizational, social, economic, financial and 
environmental issues. In this paper, we will focus on the governance issues to the extent that governance is 
a set of institutional, organizational and regulatory framework to organizing, coordinating and governing 
the urban public transport sector. The main aims of this paper are to analyze the current UPT governance 
arrangements in large Moroccan cities, to describe the reforms initiated by Moroccan government and 
discuss its main results, and to describe the target governance model of UPT and presents the progress of 
the measures taken to achieve it.

sector. The target value of this indicator is to have a revised MandE system that has been implemented in at least nine 
cities by the end of 2019. Currently, the system is in principle operational and deployed in at least three cities (Nakat 
and Salim, 2018). 
 
At local level, the objective is to strengthened local capacity to plan, implement and monitor urban transport. The first 
Intermediate Results Indicator for this objective is the number of operational inter-municipal cooperation entities 
(ICE). The target value of this indicator is to have three operational inter-municipal cooperation entities by the end of 
2019. Currently, these ICEs have been created in Rabat-Sale-Temara, Nador, Agadir and Casablanca. However, the 
ICEs of Agadir and Casablanca are the most operational ones (Nakat and Salim, 2018). 
 
The second Intermediate Results Indicator for this objective is the number of urban mobility master plans prepared 
using a structured process and a participatory approach. The target value of this indicator is to have six and seven 
prepared master plans by the end of 2018 and 2019 respectively. At present, Masterplans have been finalized and 
approved in El Jadida, Oujda and Agadir cities. Others are being finalized in Fes, Safi and Kenitra cities.  
 
The third Intermediate Results Indicator for this objective is the number of Operational municipally-owned urban 
transport enterprises. The target value of this indicator is to have for Operational municipally-owned urban transport 
enterprises by the end of 2018 and 2019 respectively. Currently, theses enterprises have been created in Marrakech, 
Agadir and Khouribga cities but are not all operational yet. The most operational one is in Marrakech. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Rapid urbanization has imposed considerable pressure on Morocco’s urban transport systems. Public urban transport 
remains inadequate, deficient in quality, and functionally disorganized, particularly in terms of bus-tramway 
integration in Rabat and Casablanca.  Intermodal transport is inefficient, as operators see themselves in competitive 
rather than complementary roles. Traffic accidents and inadequate access to public transport have disproportionately 
affected the poor, women and persons with limited mobility.  
  
The urban public transport issues are partly the results of weaknesses in governance and a significant underinvestment 
in the sector. In this paper, we have highlighted the governance problems faced by the Moroccan urban public transport 
sector in particular the institutional coordination and capacity weaknesses and the lack of a regulatory framework. We 
also discussed the first reforms initiated by the Moroccan state to improve governance as well as the reasons for failure 
to implement certain reform actions. We finally describe the target governance model of UPT and presents the progress 
of the measures taken to achieve it.

Abstract 
In order to cater to the increasing demand of rice, it is necessary to raise the average yield of paddy and 
quality of paddy significantly through best practices in planning, sourcing and delivery stages of the rice 
supply chain activities. The choice of reference processes during the design phase is of utmost importance 
for a paddy supply chains‟ overall performance. Applicability of various supply chain reference models in 
the agriculture domain will be discussed for the purpose of presenting a reference model for the rice sector 
with existing best practice related to the seed, fertilizer, water, labour and technology factors. In this 
research main objective is to identify planning and sourcing best practice of the rice supply chain and create 
best practice reference model as a collaborative tool for the rice sector. The survey was conducted in 
“Pollonnaruwa district” with the participants of farmers and agriculture officers to identify current best 
practices. The result indicate the presence of key success factor of the rice supply chain still in the initial 
stage and needs of the operational strategy for fulfillment of the existing gaps of the rice supply 
chain with best practices.

1. Introduction
Rice is the staple food of Sri Lanka and the most important agriculture sub-sector in the country. It occupies 28% of 
the arable land and provides 25% employment for the total labor force. Rice contributes 17.5% to agriculture gross 
domestic production (GDP). Rice is grown almost all the district in Sri Lanka but five districts contribute more than 
60% of the total rice production. Almost all major rice-production areas are located in the dry zone. Ampara, 
Pollonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Anurahpura and Hambamthota are the main granary area and they are in the dry zone. In 
these areas we can clearly identified effective network with integrated supply chain. For example, rice processing 
villages established in dry zone enhance the supply chain performance. Sri Lanka has just achieved near self-
sufficiency in rice. Thus the rice sector, including both production and consumption, is still plagued with a multitude 
of economic and social problems [Samaratunga, 2011].

5. Conclusions 
 
Supply chains not only benefit the sector directly involved, they also stimulate social, economic and environmental 
sustainable development within a region or country. Supply chain collaboration is of utmost importance for the 
connection with profitable markets and consumer’s demands, the flow of information, goods, technology and 
capital and to limit transaction costs. Despite there were few studies of agricultural supply chain networking and 
collaboration, 
the

is 
still 
not 
in 
focus. 
In this study analysis the current processes of planning and sourcing related to rice supply chain and identify process 
failure modes and their cause of failure related to Sri Lankan context are tested and discussed the solutions for 
preventing those failure as planning and sourcing best practices of the rice supply chain. Even though few previous 
studies are available on this topic this knowledge will be highly useful for farmers, millers, rice consumers, supplier, 
policy makers and planners in making their decisions. 
At present, rice sector in Sri Lanka faces a number of constraints related to production, socio economic and policy, 
technical, institutional and natural resource base. For Sri Lanka to reach, maintain, and even surpass self-sufficiency 
in rice production, a long term vision, careful planning, innovative research, best management practices, and efficient 
extension services will be needed. 
The vertical and horizontal integration and transparency among farmers, millers, researchers, and the government are 
key features of the rice sectors and shortage of these driving forces for the impressive competitiveness in rice sector 
generates negative impact for the counties economy. The well-integrated structure of the supply chain means 
completes and up-to-date information about supply and demand, well-defined rice quality standards, active

participation of supply chain players for their own role and research goal and the collaboration with different supply 
chain players. Innovation is another key area which gives value addition to the rice sector. Private sector, government, 
research institutes and operational level player such as farmers‟ millers align with new product development to outfit 
boosting opportunities. 
Linkage of best practice and strategies for accomplishing goals and objective of the rice sector should integrate with 
agricultural policy development and implementation. The need of strategic national agricultural policy with 
controlling and monitoring mechanisms is key requirement for the future of rice sector development.

Abstract 
To achieve competitive advantage, an organization has to measure and improve the quality of its services 
continuously, leading to customer satisfaction. This also applies to non profit organizations, such as Puskesmas, a 
government owned clinic located in sub-districts. This paper aims to determine the dimensions that can be used to 
assess the quality of puskemas’ services, so that leveraging factors in order to improve the quality of its services can 
be identified. The data are collected through surveys, which were conducted at six puskesmases in Tangerang to 200 
patients. The SERVQUAL instrument with a five factor structure is used to assess the quality of the service. Data 
were analyzed not only by descriptive analysis but also by multivariate regression analysis with Structural Equation 
Modeling (SEM). The results showed that the two dimensions of SERVQUAL had a significant influence on the 
quality of service in puskesmas, namely ‘tangibility’ and ‘assurance’. Although SERVQUAL is able to capture 
important elements in assesing service quality, it has limitations in the validity of inference. However, this study is 
still able to provide input for management of puskesmas.

1. Introduction
Quality management is important for health services. Various studies related to quality management have been 
carried out in the health sector. The implementation of quality management helps hospitals to increase their 
awareness about quality (Miguel, 2006) so that, hospitals will improve the quality of their services (Yang, 2003). 
Multiple health service organizations have implemented quality management to improve their operating processes 
(Lagrosen et al., 2007). Through the implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM), organizations are able to 
meet the real needs and expectations of customers (Lam et al., 2012). When patients get medical services, theywill 
compare their experience with his expectations. Comparisons of the expected and actual service by an outpatient is 
expressed as service satisfaction (Raposo et al., 2009). By increasing service quality, it will increase service 
satisfaction. Service quality can be determined through customer assessment toward the services (Buyukozkan et al., 
2011). Thus, to be competitive, hospitals must evaluate the quality of their services (Chaniotakis and 
Lymperopoulos, 2009). 
In Indonesia, the government is responsible for the availability of all forms of the good quality in health services, 
which are safe, efficient, and affordable to all levels of society (Article 19 of Law No. 36 of 2009). One of the 
efforts made by government to meet its responsibility in providing good quality of health services and affordable to 
all levels of society is the establishment of Puskesmas, a community health center in each sub-district (Bappenas, 
2009). Puskesmas is the technical service implementing unit of county/city government, which is responsible for 
organizing health development in the work area. The quality of service is closely related to the comparison of the 
reality and the expectation of the services to customers, namely appropriate and affordable. Puskesmas as the first-
level agent of the health service efforts is responsible for providing health services to all people who are 
administratively domiciled in their working areas. With the presence of Puskesmas, it is expected that the 
community can obtain proper quality of health services with the easiest access and affordable costs (Bappenas,

Hypothesis testing based on Table 5 shows that 'tangibility' and 'assurance' significantly affect service quality. 
Magnitude of the estimation coefficient for tangibility variable on service quality is 1,333. This indicates that if the 
tangibility variables increase by 1.0 then the service quality will increase by 1.333. Likewise, the magnitude of the 
estimation coefficient for assurance variable on service quality is 1,341. This indicates that if the assurance variables 
increase by the service quality will increase by 1,341. 
While the other three variables, namely 'responsibility', 'responsiveness' and 'empathy' do not significantly affect 
service quality. The coefficient estimate of responsibility variable on service quality is approximately -2.42 (CR 
<1.96, not significant). This research also shows that responsiveness does not affect service quality. The coefficient 
estimate of responsiveness variables on service quality is approximately -.1.35 (CR <1.96, not significant). Likewise 
with empathy, which is not significant effect on service quality, because the coefficient estimate of empathy 
variables on service quality is approximately -.5.44 (CR <1.96, not significant). 
4. Conclusion 
The research findings indicate that two dimensions of SERVQUAL, namely ‘tangibility’ and ‘assurance’, are the 
most important factors in influencing the satisfaction of the patients at puskesmases in Tangerang. This shows that 
the aspects of ‘tangibility’ and ‘assurance’ are leverage factors to improve the quality of services at puskesmases in 
Tangerang. 
The importance of ‘tangibility’ as an important factor influencing the perception of the patients at puskesmas in 
Tangerang is in line with the research on hospital service quality conducted in Turkey (Çeelik and Sehribanoglu, 
2012) and also the research on hospitals conducted in Iran (Zarei et al., 2012). The ‘tangibility’ factor consists of   
physical appearance, cleanliness and comfort and appearance of employees which are important aspects for 
improving the quality of services at puskesmas in Tangerang. 
In addition, the ‘assurance’ is also an important factor that influences the perception of patient at puskesmases in 
Tangerang. Managing human resource skills, is a leverage factor to improve the quality of Tangerang Public Health 
services. This is in line with the research on hospitals in Jordan conducted by Al-Hawary et al (2011). Therefore, a 
puskesmas, as the first level agent for health services for all the people who are administratively domiciled in its 
working area, should continuously improve the quality of its human resources.

Abstract 
 
Due to the importance internationally accorded to the environmental issues, reflected by this treaties and 
agreements, the world renewable energy demand has considerably increased during the last few years. For 
the photovoltaics (PV) generated power, for instance, the market has recorded year growth rates over 30%  
Despite its remarkable demand, the integration of the photovoltaics produced energy has been limited 
because of the production random fluctuations. Thus, the safety, the stability, and the economical 
performance of an electric power system integrating photovoltaics generated power may only be insured 
by robust and reliable power forecasting. 
This present work aims to forecast photovoltaic plant production as well as its maintenance; two critical 
features for the energy management. For the first part, we will explore the correlation between the 
photovoltaic power production and the meteorological data such as temperature, humidity and irradiance. 
This will allow us to develop a machine learning algorithm that forecasts one day ahead PV production 
using the meteorological data as inputs. 
In the second part, we will focus on the maintenance of the PV plant. We will study the reliability of its 
most important components. Then we will explore the influence of the environmental conditions in their 
most critical failures in order to integrate it to their reliability. Finally, we will propose a preventive 
maintenance plan for a finite horizon.

Petroleum is one of the industries that has a massive impact on living conditions of the population. Petroleum 
distribution network plays an increasingly important function in delivering value to the end user. The objective of this 
research is to study the current petroleum distribution network in Sri Lanka, identify the inefficiencies and causing 
critical factors and propose an optimization model to overcome these inefficiencies. A conceptual framework has been 
developed based on the findings observed from critical review of literature and further data was collected from Sri 
Lankan petroleum industry domain experts using in-depth interviews. It has been identified that Sri Lankan petroleum 
distribution network is not taken in to account for the optimization. Hence, it is performed by developing a 
mathematical model in this research. The proposed model is validated with complex and real data extracted from 
research findings. VBA (Visual Basic Application) is used to gain exact mathematical optimization. It is concluded 
from the study that distribution network overall cost can be minimized when causing critical factors are optimized. 
Thus, this study depicts an optimization model, with the purpose of minimizing the cost, based on inefficiencies and 
causing critical factors which are specific for Sri Lankan petroleum industry.  
Key words: Petroleum Distribution Network, Inefficiencies, Cost, Optimization

Abstract 
The current paradigm shift in manufacturing, widely known as Industry 4.0, exists at the nexus of advances 
happening in computer science, sensing technologies, Information and Communication Technology, and big data 
analytics. It brings together Internet of Things, social networking, and advanced analytics to meet the growing need 
of personalized production at lower costs, by integrating human-like social capabilities into the assets of an 
industrial system. In this paper, we propose an innovative Multi-Agent System based distributed operations planning 
approach for scheduling of jobs in a parallel machine shop-floor. The approach harnesses the capabilities of Cyber-
Physical Systems formed by bringing together physical machines, and various functional divisions, with their cyber 
space, or agents. These agents interact with one another to form a network of social machines. Using distributed 
decision-making and communications within the network of social assets, we tackle the complex, NP-hard problem 
of job scheduling, and compare the results with that of conventional centralized operations planning approach. The 
advantages of the proposed approach are clear in terms of reduction in computation time and lateness, and the 
flexibility offered by the distributed approach.

1. Introduction
A supervisory control system is essential for a manufacturing system to fulfill its utility. Dilts et al. (1991) have 
classified the manufacturing control systems into four types viz. centralized, hierarchical, semi-hierarchical and 
heterarchical. This classification is based on the distribution of the decision-making power. Centralized systems are 
characterized by a single node responsible for all the system level decision-making. The hierarchical and semi-
hierarchical systems have several control levels, thereby allowing partial distribution of decision-making power. On 
the other hand, heterarchical systems have no fixed relationships within the constituent decision-makers. 
    Traditionally, the manufacturing control systems have been all centralized or hierarchical. Such systems are 
useful for mass production or for larger batch sizes. However they fail to address the challenges of growing 
consumer demands for high quality customized products with shorter life cycles, and the rising requirements of 
flexibility, expansibility, agility and re-configurability for the manufacturing systems (Leitão, 2009; Hu, 2013). 
Leitão (2009) points out that the distributed and intelligent control systems satisfying these needs are different from 
the ones conventionally used. Characterized by autonomous and local decision-makers, the distributed heterarchical 
systems have strong tolerance to the disturbances and ease of expansion, although at the cost of reduced global-
optimization (Leitão, 2009). Of the distributed systems, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Holonic Manufacturing 
Systems (HMS) have received major interest in academia, and in industry. MAS aim at dividing a system level task 
(or goal) into numerous sub-tasks being allotted to the entities which comprise the system. These entities, which 
interact with one another to achieve their goals, are called agents. HMS are a manufacturing-centric approach

7. Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper proposes an innovative Multi-Agent System based distributed operations planning approach for 
scheduling of jobs in a parallel machine shop-floor. The approach is demonstrated for various cases. Each case is 
solved by the proposed distributed approach and conventional centralized approach to compare the results. Here, 
two different optimization techniques Adaptive Thermo-statistical Simulated Annealing (ATSA) and brute force are 
utilized for optimization. The proposed distributed approach utilizes cyber-physical-systems, parallel computing and 
communication capabilities of various agents (machine and PPC). This is one of the essential requirements of 
decision-making in smart factories under Industry 4.0. For complex problems, distributed approach provides best 
solution in least computation time. Therefore, distributed approach can be one of the alternatives for shop-floor 
operations planning for next generation manufacturing systems. In an event of failure, sudden surge in demand, or 
any other disturbance the system can go for rescheduling of jobs. This is made possible by the highly reduced 
computation time.  
    The future prospects are two-fold. First, to resemble the real-world manufacturing shop-floor more closely, the 
number of components of the machines can be increased and the processing times of the jobs can be different for 
different machines. The Maintenance Department can also know the quality of labor available and evaluate the 
variances in the PM-Jobs description, like the changes in restoration factors when using skilled or semi-skilled 
workforce. Secondly, the benefits of collaborative and distributed decision-making presented in this work can be 
carried forward to represent the entire shop-floor using agents, which collaborate with one another to govern several 
different operations. The agents can be used to represent the raw-materials, the consumers, the AGVs, etc.

1. Introduction
Due to the continuously growing health care demands, health care is becoming increasingly expensive. A key issue 
for successful health care management is staff scheduling. The scheduling problem involves allocating suitably 
qualified staff to meet a time-dependent demand for different services. The problem of physician scheduling is one 
that affects most healthcare systems. So, building good work schedules can greatly influence physicians’ working 
conditions, which is strongly reflected in the healthcare quality.  
Emergency department (ER) is a very critical department in any hospital since it is the first line that faces emergency 
situations. Scheduling of ER stuff to handle patients’ demands is highly required (Yang et al. 2009). ER is one of the 
most stressful place for physicians in hospitals. Thus, the quality as well as the efficiency of scheduling practices that 
at the same time matches economic needs, personnel’s preferences and a higher level of care for the patients have a 
large contribution to the overall hospital performance. Unlike any other physicians, ED physicians do not determine, 
or control, the number of patients who are present for treatment. Preparing a schedule for physicians in the emergency 
department is a complex and time-consuming task, which requires taking into account a large number of rules, usually 
conflicting, respected to various aspects such as maximum number of consecutive shifts, night shifts and weekends 
rules, vacation periods, and physician’s individual preferences. The problem is further complicated by such factors as: 
patient demand’s variation, physician qualification and specialization, severity of patient illnesses, organizational 
characteristics (e.g., minimum required coverage and days off policies) and personal preferences and requests for

6. Conclusion 
In this paper, we have dealt with a real-world physicians scheduling problem from The KKUH Emergency Department in 
KSA. This problem is computationally hard to solve and constitutes a time-consuming task for the scheduler. The Iterated Local 
Search has been proposed to solve it. The results demonstrate that the proposed schedule outperforms the manual one in several 
aspects. Moreover, the results indicate that high-quality schedules can be obtained within a few seconds.

Abstract 
 
When a Manufacturing- or Service-System gets into a deadlocked state none of the activities can proceed 
towards completion.   When the same system is in a livelocked state, some activity of the system enters a 
state of suspended animation and is never completed, while other activities proceed to completion without 
hindrance.  A livelock-free system does not experience deadlocks; but a deadlock-free system can 
experience livelocks.  This tutorial is about the synthesis of livelock avoidance policies for 
Manufacturing- and Service-Systems that are modeled by Petri Nets (PNs).   
 
After characterizing livelock-freedom, we introduce the paradigm of liveness enforcing supervisory 
policies (LESPs).  An LESP is said to be minimally restrictive, if the fact that it prevents the occurrence 
of an event at a given state is reason enough to infer that all livelock-avoidance policies would do the 
same.  If there is an LESP for a system, there is a unique minimally restrictive LESP. We restrict attention 
to LESPs that can be implemented using a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) expression on the state of the 
PN modeling the system. We describe the process of synthesizing the minimally restrictive LESPs using

1. Introduction 
 
The domain of discourse for this paper is the operational level control of a manufacturing system, the 
contention-resolution of shared resources in computer networks, or the operations-management of multi-
component organizations with event driven dynamics like shipyards and airports, etc. These systems are 
representatives of the family of Discrete-Event/Discrete-State (DEDS) systems. They are characterized by 
state variables that have a logical or symbolic interpretation. The dynamics of DEDS systems arise due to 
the occurrence of specific events, and the state-variables of such systems are piecewise constant with 
discontinuities at the occurrence-instants of these events.  At each discrete-state, there are potential 
discrete-events that can occur, the occurrence of any one of them would change the state of the system, 
which then results in a new set of events that could occur, and this process can be repeated as often as 
necessary. Air-traffic control systems; automated manufacturing systems; computer networks; integrated 
command, control, communication and information (C3I) systems; operations-management of multi-
component organizations with event-driven dynamics like shipyards, airports, hospitals, etc. are examples

6. Conclusions 
 
Using an illustrative example we described how the operations in a manufacturing- or service-systems 
could be modeled using Petri nets.  These systems are prone to livelocks, where an activity never 
progresses to completion, while the other activities proceed normally.  We showed how a livelock 
avoidance policy could be synthesized for these systems using a software tool from the literature.

Figure 2 shows the PN model for the task sequence for Robot 2.  As noted above, transitions t1 and t2 
represent the operations of putting the base-coat and the clear-coat in Booth 1 and Booth 2, respectively.  
Transition t4 (resp. t5) represents the operation where Robot 2 is commissioned to the clear-coat (resp. 
base-coat) paint-operation.  The presence of a token in place p4 indicates Robot 2 is ready to be 
commissioned for any of the two paint tasks. The present of a token in place p5 (resp. place p6) indicates 
Robot 2 is ready to apply the clear-coat (resp. the base-coat) in Booth 2 (resp. Booth 1).  The transitions t4 
and t5 are controllable, in that the decisions about how Robot 2 is commissioned is to be made by the 
supervisory policy enunciated in subsequent text.

deadlock where no activity can be completed.  Figure 5 demonstrates the deadlock that arises when Robot

We will now demonstrate the use of the software product described in references (Chandrasekaran,

That is, for any 𝐦𝐦𝟎𝟎∈ Δ(𝑁𝑁) (i.e. any 𝐦𝐦𝟎𝟎∈ ℕ6 that is greater-than-or-equal-to any one of the six minimal 
elements listed above), there is a supervisory policy that can prevent the occurrence of any livelocks (and 
consequently, any deadlocks as well).

𝒎𝒎1 𝑡𝑡4→𝒎𝒎2 (resp. 𝒎𝒎1 𝑡𝑡5→𝒎𝒎2) and 𝒎𝒎𝟐𝟐∉Δ(𝑁𝑁).   This policy is the minimally restrictive LESP for N(m0) for 
any 𝐦𝐦𝟎𝟎∈ Δ(𝑁𝑁), where N is the PN structure shown in figure 3. Alternately, from the results of reference

where N is the PN structure shown in figure 3 will permit the firing of controllable transition t4 only if this

Abstract 
Developing a complex product in a concurrent engineering environment requires managing information flow among 
ten or even hundreds of people of different specialties organized in a large number of cross-function product 
development (PD) teams. This paper proposes an approach based on centrality measures in social networks for 
modeling and analyzing the information flows among PD teams. One advantage of this approach is that it enables PD 
project managers to identity the key PD teams based on a proposed new classification system that classifies PD teams 
under four categories: autonomous, receivers, transmitters, and transceivers.  A demonstrative example adapted from 
the literature is presented.

1. Introduction
To overcome the limitation of a lengthy and traditional serial product development process, many companies opted to 
adopt concurrent engineering—a management and engineering philosophy for product development that emerged in 
the 1980s (Creese and Moore 1990).  In addition to shortening product development time, and thus time to the market, 
the reported benefits of this practice include reduced costs, fewer engineering changes, reduction of defects, rework 
and scrap, higher quality and return on assets (Lawson and Karandikar 1994).  
In concurrent engineering, the product development process can be accelerated through performing overlapped 
activities simultaneously by cross-functional product development (PD) teams. These teams need to continuously 
exchange information on specified tasks to integrate the product’s final structure (Batallas and Yassine 2006). 
Performing overlapped activities simultaneously necessary for accelerating the development process, but, at the same 
time, it increases the complexity of communication and coordination among PD teams (Loch and Terwiesch 1998), 
especially those PD teams involved in the development of complex products—such as automobiles, airplanes, and 
others—which require the involvement of hundreds or even thousands of specialists. For instance, the number of 
people involved in developing an automobile can reach over 1600, whereas the number of those working on the 
development of an airplane can reach over 16,0000 (Smith and Eppinger 1998). Therefore, effective information flow 
is one of the most important success factors in PD (Newman 2001; Yang et al. 2014).  The first step towards this 
achievement is to have a modeling tool for capturing and analyzing information flows among PD teams. A brief review 
of the studies that have addressed this issue is given below.  
2. Literature Review
McCord and Eppinger (1993) provide, perhaps, one of the earliest studies tackling the the issue of how to capture and 
analyze information flows among PD teams.  In that study, Design structure matrix (DSM) was used to capture the 
frequency and direction of information flow among PD teams in an automobile engine development project. Browning 
(1998; 1999) investigated mechanisms among cross-functional PD teams and then applied it to the development of a

which have relatively high out-degree and in-degree centrality. The fourth quadrant contains transmitters (PD teams 10 
and 16): these have relatively high out-degree centrality but low in-degree centrality.  
 
Autonomous PD teams have the least amount of information exchange with other PD teams.  On the other hand, 
transceivers acquire/send information from/to other many PD teams. Therefore, mangers should pay particular 
attention to streamlining information exchange between transceivers and other teams to avoid possible project 
bottlenecks, but they should also keep in mind that these PD teams have opportunities to become potential project 
integrators and innovation diffusers (Kazanjian et al.  2000).

5. Conclusions 
 
Modeling and analyzing information flows among PD teams is a challenging issue for PD projects. Design structure 
matrix and social networks analysis were found to be most commonly used tools in the literature. Taking into account 
some limitations of previous relevant studies, this paper presented an approach for modeling information flows among 
PD teams consisting of three major steps: mapping interdependencies, network visualization and then classifying the 
PD teams according to their in-degree and out-degree centrality values into four categories—autonomous, receivers,

transmitters, and transceivers. The usefulness of the proposed approach was demonstrated through an illustrative 
example adapted from the literature and involving a PD project comprising of 22 PD teams working on developing an 
automobile engine.  
 
Lastly, in addition to the measures used in this study and in previous studies, there are likely other measures that may 
be useful for analyzing information flows and other metrics that may be useful for analyzing interdependences from 
different perspectives. This could be explored in a future study.

Abstract 
Previous studies have identified and modeled various factors affecting project success in the construction industry. 
However, in order to design and implement an effective program for achieving project success, it is necessary to 
integrate all the identified success factors (SFs) and their links to success criteria (SCs) into a single comprehensive 
model. This was accomplished in this study by using social network analysis, in which 19 SFs and 9 SCs were 
represented by a comprehensive graphical model. This model was complemented with a cross-impact matrix 
multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) analysis in order to classify SFs and SCs in terms of their driving 
powers and dependence levels. Accordingly, the key factors for project success have been identified as effective 
project team formation, effective communication, support from top management, clearly defined goals and objectives, 
and the project manager’s competence.

1. Introduction
The intense competition in today’s world market forces organizations in the construction industry to examine how to 
ensure the success of their projects as they seek to enhance their competitiveness. However, project success is one of 
the most widely discussed subjects in the project management literature. Despite this, there appears to be no academic 
consensus on a generally acceptable definition of project success (Hughes et al. 2004, Ozorhon et al.  2007, Ozorhon 
et al. 2010). That said, scholars such as  Ozorhon et al. (2010) and Lei et al. (2017) have construed success from the 
perspective of the “generic” triple constraints of time, cost, and quality. In reality, however, the notion of a triple 
constraint is very restricted and, in fact, represents an unrealistic approach to assessing the success of projects (see 
Atkinson 1999, Barclay and Osei-Bryson 2010, Bourne et al. 2002, Shenhar et al.  2001). However, despite these 
claims, as Barclay and Osei-Bryson (2010) point out, these criteria for project success continue to dominate project 
management practice.  
Recognizing the unrealistic and restricted nature of the triple constraint measures, more recent research has sought to 
expand how project success is measured. Drawing from an acknowledgment that the success of projects is primarily 
multidimensional (Ojiako et al.  2008, Shenhar et al.  2001), more recent project success measures have sought to 
incorporate wider criteria such as stakeholder satisfaction, customer satisfaction, user satisfaction, and productivity 
(Bryde and Robinson 2005, Chua et al. 1999, Collins and Baccarint 2004, Gunathilaka et al. 2013, Griffith et al. 1999,  
Nitithamyong  and Tan 2007,  Shokri-Ghasabeh and  Kavousi-Chabok 2009). The first step towards achieving project 
success is to identify success factors (SFs) and their links to selected project success criteria (SCs). A brief review of 
the literature that has addressed this issue is given below. 
2. Literature Review
SFs can be defined as variables that can be influenced to increase the likelihood of project success (Muller and Turner 
2007), whereas SCs can be defined as measures used to judge the successful outcome of a project. In the literature, 
the reported links between SFs and SCs have been identified either conceptually or empirically. For instance, Pinto

6. Conclusions 
 
Decision makers should be aware of not only the relative importance of the various SFs and their direct impact on 
SCs, but also the relationships among them. Based on the results reported previously in the literature and on expert 
opinions, 19 SFs and their interrelationships with 9 SCs were identified and used to build a comprehensive graphical 
model using social network analysis. As a complement to this model, a MICMAC analysis was performed to classify 
the modeled variables based on their driving powers and dependence levels. Three clusters of SFs and SCs were 
identified: a cluster of autonomous variables, a cluster of dependent variables, and a cluster of independent variables. 
Accordingly, effective project team formation, effective communication, support from top management, clearly 
defined goals and objectives, and the project manager’s competence are the keys to project success. Therefore, project 
managers should pay special attention to these SFs, since otherwise, any efforts towards achieving success would be 
futile. The present study can be extended in several ways. In particular, future research may consider modeling and 
analyzing the interrelationships among SFs and SCs in projects in other industries. Using fuzzy interrelationships 
instead of binary interrelationships may also be considered in future studies.

Abstract 
Several methods and tools have been developed to support managing project portfolios. However, despite the 
increasing attention on project portfolio management (PPM) over the last decade from both academic and 
practitioners, very few methods and tools have been proposed for modeling dependencies among projects within a 
portfolio. For better visualizing interdependencies among projects, this paper proposes to apply interpretive structural 
modeling (ISM) for structuring project interdependencies into a simple graphical hierarchical model. For 
demonstration, this method is applied to a portfolio consisting of 22 interdependent projects.

1. Introduction
The project portfolio management (PPM) field has quickly grown in the research arena during the past decade. Levine 
(2005) defined PPM as “a set of processes, supported by people and tools, to guide the enterprise in selecting the right 
projects and the right number of projects, and maintaining a portfolio of projects that will maximize the enterprise's 
strategic goals, efficient use of resources, stakeholder satisfaction, and the bottom line.” 
Earlier PPM researchers have focused on the following areas: projects prioritization, project selection, risk 
management, and resource management. But, the management of projects interdependency requires additional 
research (Teller et al., 2012), since projects within a portfolio are not separately executed where they interrelate and 
have project interdependencies within the organization portfolio and are required to be studied and evaluated (Al Zaabi 
& Bashir, 2018; Killen & Kjaer, 2012; Rungi & Hilmola, 2011; Engwall & Jerbrant, 2003; Hamidovic & Krajnovic, 
2005). Rungi (2010) conducted an empirical study on PPM practices within organizations and found higher rates of 
project success when organizations consider project interdependencies. However, Rungi and Hilmola (2011) found 
that organizations that have failed to reflect project interdependencies in their practices may cause cannibalization in 
their target market, which may lead to negative effects on the project portfolio’s commercial success. Moreover, 
ignoring projects interdependencies in PPM practice can cause slippage in project schedules (Formentini & Romano, 
2011) and unanticipated risk changes (Sanchez et al., 2009), which may threaten the portfolio balance between the 
following estimated project parameters: project time, risks, and anticipated profits.  
The definition of project interdependencies has been given in the previous literature in different and diverse ways. 
However, it can be classified overall into five categories as follows: resource, market, knowledge, outcome, and 
benefit interdependencies. 
•
Resource interdependencies arise due to resource sharing and allocation demands among different projects,
including technology. Staudenmayer (1997) claimed that resource interdependencies are found in three conditions:
resource demand presence, resource limited availability, and inadequate resources allocation. Blichfeldt and
Eskerod (2008) argued that resource interdependency is the most important interdependency type in PPM and
obtains the highest consideration overall from portfolio managers in comparison to the remaining types of project
interdependencies.

4. Conclusion 
 
Investigating interdependency between projects is a challenging field in PPM practice. Optimization models and visual 
tools are considered methods and tools that utilize interdependencies within a portfolio. Visual PPM tools are believed 
to illustrate a better understanding of the interdependencies between projects. However, the existing PPM visual tools 
have some drawbacks relating to project roadmaps, the dependency matrix, the nested options model, and visual 
project maps. Project roadmapping is a basic model to visualize projects and produce detail overload. While the nested 
options model is valid for small project portfolios, the dependency matrix does not present multilevel or accumulated 
project interdependencies. Moreover, visual project mapping is often very complex, and it is difficult to trace the 
interdependencies among the projects. 
 
To overcome these limitations, the ISM is implemented in this study to convert the complex graph used for visualizing 
project interdependencies into a simpler graphical hierarchical graph. The benefits of using the ISM methodology 
were presented through an illustrative example of a project portfolio consisting of 22 interdependent projects. 
 
The ISM methodology arranged the projects in a hierarchical structure model including five levels that was simpler 
than VPM. The ISM model arranges the bottom level of the hierarchy (projects: M, E, U, X, A, I and O) as the more 
important projects based on their interdependency within the portfolio. The outcome of the ISM model can help 
decision makers to pay attention to bottom level, middle level, and then top level projects. Cancelling, delaying, or 
significantly altering any one of the bottom level projects will have negative effects on many projects in the portfolio. 
Moreover, middle level projects are the most difficult projects to manage, since they depend on many other projects, 
while many other projects depend on them at the same time. Top level projects do not have much interdependency 
within the portfolio. 
 
Finally, in addition to the ISM model used in this study, other methods would likely be useful for understanding the 
interdependencies of a project portfolio. The other methods could be used as complementary tools along with the ISM 
method for analyzing interdependences from different perspectives. This could be explored in a future study.

Abstract 
Service organizations are looking for ways to better deliver services through use of information and communication 
technology and to increase customers’ intention to use that service provider again. Service providers can differentiate 
themselves by making perception of their service delivery process effective and efficient. Past research shows that 
customer’s belief about service delivery process impacts the attitude towards the service provider leads to intension 
to use service providers in future. This study adopts the Belief-Attitude-Intension (B-A-I) model regarding e-service 
delivery process in online retailing context. For belief about e-service delivery from customers’ perspective, five 
constructs are considered i.e. perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived flexibility, perceived control, and 
perceived risk. With data collected from a sample of 442 Indian e-tail customers, this research uses mediated 
regression to examine the influence of customer’s belief about e-service delivery process on consumers’ behavioral 
intentions, and the mediating role attitude towards service provider plays in the relationship. The findings indicate that 
all five belief constructs are associated with behavioral intentions to use service provider again in future and that 
attitude towards service provider partially mediates the relationship for all five belief’s constructs. The implications 
for theory and practice are discussed. This study suggested what customers’ belief are important in a service delivery 
process and contributes managerial implications.

Abstract 
Interest in measuring corporate sustainable development performance has increased considerably in recent years. 
Efforts to define, quantify, and measure progress in sustainable development have contributed to the development of 
a wide variety of indicators, expressed in technical language, and targeting the multi-dimensional aspects of 
sustainable development. Such interest has favored the emergence of various organizations specialized in sustainable 
development performance measurement and the development of an ever-increasing number of international standards 
and indices. Examples of such standards include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Pacific Sustainability Index 
(PSI), the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) supported by the World 
Bank Group, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), ISO 26000, ISO 14001, TOTAL and FORD 
indicators grids, UN Global compact, etc. In addition, over the last decade, an overwhelming number of scientific 
publications have suggested a variety of indicators for corporate sustainability performance assessment in different 
industrial contexts. In the same vein, many governments have also worked hard to identify indicators and set targets 
for measuring progress on sustainable development. 
The objective of this paper is twofold. First, this paper exposes the results of a systematic review covering both 
professional and scientific literature. Second, it draws up an inventory of SD indicators and proposed an indicator grid 
specific to manufacturing companies. These indicators will allow i) to monitor and measure the impacts of the 
manufacturing company's sustainable activities, ii) to facilitate comparisons and rankings between companies, iii) to 
improve communication with stakeholders (Fiorino, 2006; Perrini & Tencati, 2006), iv) to inform decision-making 
processes (Perrini and Tencati, 2006) and v) to offer companies (whether or not engaged in sustainable development 
activities) assist them in selecting relevant and appropriate actions for sustainable development. 
In terms of results, a systematic review of the scientific literature and the professional standards was conducted. On 
one hand, 610 articles were collected for the period 2007-2017 and a detailed analysis was carried out on 141 articles 
dealing with sustainability performance assessment for manufacturing companies. On the other hand, 7 standards and 
their associated indicators were analyzed (GRI, ISO-16000, DJSI / RebecoSam, UQAC grid, United Nations, Ford 
PSI, TOTAL). Results in terms of indicators provided by the scientific literature and the standards were confronted. 
They show that novel sub-dimensions and aspects, not yet included in the existing standards, emerged from the

Abstract 
In this work, finite element simulations based on the analytical model derived with the MATLAB software were used 
to establish the temperature fields within the cutting tool and tool-chip interface. The average tool-chip interface 
temperature model was simulated and the simulation results were compared with experimental results for validation. 
At a maximum cutting speed of 90 m/min, the maximum temperature obtained from the experiment was 410 
oC, at
same rake angle of 0
o. However, the developed model predicted 490 
oC under the same conditions. The higher value
obtained by the model can be attributed to the negligence of heat losses to the surrounding by both convection and 
radiation modes, as an assumption in the formulated model. A similar trend of these results was also recorded for the 
case of rake angle and feed rate of 30
o and 0.0635 mm/rev, respectively. It was observed that the simulation results
and experimental measurements for the average tool-chip interface temperature agreed significantly.

1. Introduction
The process of machining has been a subject of research over the last six decades (Kegg, 1965; Astakhov, 1999;
Altintas, 2000). Friction plays an important role during cutting of materials, as the cutting tool and workpiece
continuously rub or slide on each to transform the material from elastic stage to plastic phase, where permanent shear
or cutting takes place. Therefore, it is imperative to understanding the machining parameters that affect frictional
force. Also, cutting parameters must be optimised to minimise the friction since average of 55% of the energy
consumed during machining process is used to deform materials and causes chip formation. If it is non-optimised
process, greater part of the remaining energy is used for the conversion of the useful energy to the heat energy, from
interface temperature between tool-workpiece and chips (Astakhov, 2006). Consequently, a stable cutting machine,
less time, cutting and energy consumption/power are possible with when a cutting forced is reduced (Astakhov, 2005). 
The importance of the machining parameters cannot be undermined toward determination of the efficiency and
effectiveness of a machining operation.  The process of machining is affected by several parameters. These include,
but are not limited to, depth of cut, tool rake angle, cutting speed, cutting tool edge angle, feed rate and the properties
of the workpiece materials used (Bayoumi et al., 1994).

Abstract 
Achieving a career development as a university faculty member is dependent on having a vibrant thoughtful of 
how to combine the activities of teaching, research and service in a way that makes the best use of the time and 
resources available. Faculty members are expected to make substantive contributions to the learning of their students 
and to their field, as well as to make service contributions to the university and community. Faculty members are more 
likely to make considerable contributions when they have well-defined objectives and a clear plan for reaching those 
aims. This paper focuses on the challenge of managing the three responsibilities of the faculty member of teaching, 
research and service. Understanding this challenge and being prepared for it should help for a smoother transition. 
In addition to these responsibilities, authors suggested that one should not lose sight of the role model that a faculty 
member is and to recognize this from the start. This is the moral dimension of the life of the academic and has a great 
influence on the harmony of the workplace and the ability to tackle the many challenges of teaching, research, and 
services in such a way as to leave a lasting legacy.  
Keywords 
Moral mission, new faculty, research, service, teaching. 
1. Introduction
On their first day of work, new faculty may hear something like, “Welcome to the Department. We’re glad to have
you here. Here are the keys to your office. Your lab is down the hall. Good luck.” Other universities, offer the new 
faculty member. However, at the start of a career there is much to learn. For this reason, this paper has been written 
to provide some friendly advice and suggestions to a doctoral student/ postdoc/ who aims for a tenure track faculty 
position.  
Some universities provide assistance to the new faculty in developing his or her road map in the form of a mentor 
as well as other sources of advice to help build a good foundation for what he/she intends to be a lifelong career. If 
one is in university that has developed such a mentoring program you are off to a good start.  
The availability of mentors in teaching and research support and of other sources of professional advice is well 
established in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science in Memorial University. A number of experienced 
faculty members recognized as outstanding teachers and/or accomplished researchers have been nominated to serve 
as mentors to help guide and to provide support to new faculty members in developing their teaching and research 
activities. In addition, help in developing teaching skills and effectiveness is offered through a partnership between 
the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science and the teaching and learning specialists in the DELTS Office 
(Distance Education, Learning and Teaching Support). DELTS provides seminars as well as a number of advanced 
technology resources for faculty, including Desire2Learn (Memorial’s Learning Management System), online rooms

support, and sacrifice of the teachers often when they were having a difficult time in their lives. These were true 
“servant teachers.” 
 
This award pays tribute to the faculty member as a role model. While there is no numerical scale to evaluate this aspect 
of a future faculty member at the hiring stage or even later, it is recognized and deeply valued by students and by the 
university. It is a vital quality to have in the workplace environment and should be evaluated in reference letters and 
the interview as best as can be achieved at that time. Some candidates may not be suited to the role of a faculty member 
and if hired may create problems both for themselves and the institution. 
 
5. The Virtuous Cycle 
 
Teaching, research and service form a triad of the primary activities of the faculty member. Rather than seeing 
them as independent activities, they can be viewed as forming a “virtuous circle.” Students exposed to high quality 
teaching and learning experiences become appreciative alumni and some develop a passion to pursue graduate 
research. Good research benefits society and evokes positive evaluations of the university which, in turn, helps bring 
funding and draws high quality faculty. Also, excellent students are attracted to a university that is famous for the 
quality of teaching, and research. Service activities, notably those external to the university build bridges and closer 
working relationships with industry personnel and open opportunities for developing joint university-industry 
relationships and useful contacts for employment of students. Fig. 1 illustrates the virtuous cycle and how faculty can 
influence graduate students who will be the future new faculty members.

6. Conclusions 
 
This paper provides some personal reflections on the three roles of the professor in teaching, research, and service 
activities, for those who are planning to go to graduate school and then on to a tenure track position. In addition, the 
author believes that there is a dimension in the role of the faculty member that is primary in achieving true excellence 
as a scholar that might be called the moral dimension or moral mission or leaving a legacy.  
 
On the occasion of the 60th birthday celebration of the famous astronomer, Carl Sagan, the President of Cornell 
University, Frank Rhodes, said, “I want to salute Carl Sagan as the embodiment of everything that is best in academic 
life in scholarship, teaching, and service. Carl is an inspiring example of the engaged, global citizen. He is a master

of synthesis, and he has used that skill to engage us as a society in some of the biggest issues of our time. With the 
conscience of a humanist and the consummate skill of the scientist, he addresses the needs of the society in which we 
live, and we are the richer for it.” (Terzian, 1997). That is a legacy every faculty member should aspire to leave.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents an investigation of engineering failure modes for INCONEL601 tested after exposure to annealed 
heat-treatment (1.5 hour duration) and as received prior to annealing. Microstructural and failure surfaces were tested 
for chemical composition and examined by metallographic techniques and fatigue fractography. Scanning electron 
microscopy and enginery dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) revealed the presence of voids, dimples, and striations 
associated with fatigue crack propagation. The microstructural characterization of annealed INCONEL601 is notable 
for triangular voids that congregate along grain boundaries in contrast to the as received INCONEL601. In addition, 
the tensile and fatigue strengths of as-received samples were greater than annealed heat-treated INCONEL601.

 1. Introduction 
 
Super alloys are widely used in the gas turbine industry where components are subjected to the combined effects of 
mechanical and thermal stresses, high temperatures, and corrosive environments. The output and efficiency of the 
turbine system increases as the hot gas temperature increases at the turbine inlet. As a result, advanced materials have 
been developed to better resist high stresses and corrosion effects at higher temperatures.  
 
INCONEL alloy is one of a series of superalloys that use alloying elements such as aluminum, titanium, chromium, 
and nickel to develop enhanced properties. These alloying elements form passive films that increase resistance to 
corrosion in aggressive environments (Sahn et al. 1974). The combination of high strength and oxidation resistance at 
high temperatures of INCONEL in corrosive environments has led to a variety of applications. The physical and 
mechanical properties of INCONEL alloys, including failure and fracture analysis under static and dynamic loading 
have been extensively researched (Akio et al. 1988), (Gonzalez et al.1998), (Lin et al. 1977), and (Vankanhtesh et 
al.1998). (Norio et al. 1977) reported on microstructural observations that revealed high dislocation density interaction 
within the grain structure that resulted in strain hardening and improved strength as well as influencing fracture surface 
and crack initiation of INCONEL alloys. It was found that cracks were preferably initiated within or adjacent to grain 
boundaries and grew by crossing grains and propagating through the grain structure. In another study, the fatigue 
lifetime, crack initiation and propagation during dynamic loading of INCONEL was found to be primarily controlled 
by the growth of cracks smaller than 1 mm in length (Gary et al. 1977).  
 
Microscopic investigations of INCONEL alloys indicated that the presence of gamma and gamma prime depends is 
product of the addition of INCONEL alloys (Pandy et al. 1996). The presence of gamma and gamma prime varied 
with heat treatment and, in consequence, the alloy properties. A study (Whittenberger et al. 1994) on INCONEL617 
evaluated the mechanical properties under static tensile loading while fracture surface characteristics and crack growth 
of heat treated INCONEL617 were examined in (Shang et al. 1993). In other research, careful observation found that 
during high temperature fatigue, the effects of dynamic recovery tended to become increasingly evident. This was 
considered to be due to high dislocation density and thus high dislocation motion at higher fatigue cycles 
(Swaminathan et al. 1992).

Figure 7. Transition between ductile intergranular fatigue striation and dimples rupture. From upper left to bottom right 
 
Mechanical testing of the alloy is performed in both SSC curves (Fig. 3a) and S-N curves (Fig. 3b). The effects of annealing 
heat treatment have been examined against the characteristics of as received INCONEL601 alloy. Annealed heat treatment 
produced little effect on the tensile strength and fatigue strength relative to as received INCONEL601 alloy. Slight changes 
were found between as received and annealed heat treated INCONEL601 alloy fracture surfaces produced from tensile 
and fatigue testing. However, striation features observed due to cyclic loading (Fig. 6) is the main distinction from tensile 
fracture surfaces (Fig. 5). The fracture appearance is typical of ductile failure with no evidence of cleavage fracture. It was 
therefore concluded that tensile and fatigue strength was higher for as received than for annealed INCONEL601 alloy. 
Moreover, the cracks originating along grain boundaries are the primary cause for increasing rate of cyclic fracture, with 
the existence of dimples on the fracture surfaces indicating the occurrence of fast dimple rupture (Fig. 7). It may be 
observed from the tensile test results that fracture surface of the INCONEL601 alloy sample become ductile for the 
annealed INCONEL601 alloy as shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b, respectively. The ductility may be associated with reduction 
of the effective stress. The tensile fracture surfaces show grain boundary facets and dimples, which are both evidence of 
softening and ductility. Rupture dimples and voids produced while the fatigue fracture occurred as shown in Fig. 7. A 
variety of sizes of dimples was found on the facets and at arrays of regular striations at the transgranular facets. Moreover, 
secondary cracking occurred at the roots of striations. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Tensile and fatigue strength were measured in different heat treatment as received and annealed of INCONEL601 alloy 
result showed a slight reduction in tensile and fatigue strength. Changes in heat treatment altered the alloy microstructure 
especially the grain boundaries morphologies through the development of voids triangular geometry that led to reduced 
strength both tensile and fatigue life. 
Stress-strain curves exhibited an initial regime of linear elastic behavior for both as received and annealed INCONEL601 
alloys with yield strength approximately 370MPa followed by plastic deformation. The plastic region exhibited differences 
in behavior. The as received INCONEL601 alloy revealed higher strength than annealed INCONEL601 alloy with a value 
of 785 and 775MPa respectively. 
S-N curves exhibited fatigue strength behavior of as received greater than annealed INCONEL601 alloy of approximately 
495 and 475MPa, respectively.

Abstract 
In this paper, blood supply chain management has been considered for critical conditions. The supply chain problem 
considered the unique features of blood such as its perishability, availability only from human resources, limited 
supply of blood for transfusion treatments and uncertainty. To solve this problem, a mixed integer programming model 
was developed with the aim of minimizing costs incurred by shortage and wastage. The proposed model was solved 
by the optimization software GAMS and to demonstrate effectiveness of the model, numerical samples were presented 
according to information received from the Tehran Blood Transfusion Center to determine accuracy and efficiency of 
the model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted on key parameters of the model (risk of damage to hospitals, demand 
and capacity) that analyze the factors applied to the model. Given that the optimum value of the model was taken as 
a balance between shortage cost and waste cost (by adding two units to the blood center capacity, results showed that 
supply chain cost was reduced by 45%), taking into account the existing problems in the area, consistent with the real 
world, this model investigated the planning and management of a blood supply chain in critical conditions by 
determining how to meet the hospital’s needs.

Abstract 
This paper deals with the problem of selection and scheduling of interdependent projects in an integrated 
manner. Two types of interdependencies among projects-mutual exclusiveness and complementariness are 
considered which are found to be of great practical importance. The problem seeks to maximize the total 
expected benefit from the selected projects wherein the benefit from a project is considered to be time-
dependent.  A mathematical model for the problem along with an illustrative example is presented. A modified 
genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to solve the real life problems. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a 
set of randomly generated test problems with varying complexity. The performance of the proposed GA is 
compared with TS algorithm. The results show that proposed GA outperforms the TS algorithm in 10 test 
problems out of the total 15 problems generated in this study.

1. Introduction
Project firms pursue multiple projects sharing a pool of resources. The success of these projects largely depends 
on the selection of right mix of the projects hence and project selection is a crucial decision in a firm. Project 
selection problem involves the selection of most profitable projects from a large set of available candidate 
projects to optimize the firm’s stated objective(s) respecting the resource, budget and other technical limitations. 
But models developed for project selection generally exclude project scheduling in the selection process (Coffin 
& Taylor, 1996a; 1996b). Traditionally, projects are selected first and then attempt is made to schedule these 
projects through various procedures in light of the available time and resources. If the selected projects cannot 
be scheduled, some of the projects may be dropped/changed, schedule may be relaxed or resource limit may be 
extended, ultimately resulting in a suboptimal portfolio. Thus project scheduling should be considered as an 
integral part of the project selection problem. This integrated problem of selection and scheduling of projects is 
known as project portfolio selection and scheduling problem (PPSSP). In recent years the PPSSP has gained 
attention of many researchers and has become an active field of research. 
Maximizing the total expected benefit has been the popular objective in project selection problems as well as in 
integrated project selection and scheduling problems (PPSSP). Moreover, the benefit from a project is 
considered to be time-dependent (Chen & Askin, 2009). This is especially true in the case of projects related to 
introducing new products to the market. Early market entry helps the firm to acquire a larger market share than 
the late entrants This time-sensitive aspect of benefit in PPSSP is first considered by Chen & Askin (2009) and 
followed by Ghorbani & Rabbani (2009), Tofighian & Naderi (2015), Ganji et al. (2016), Amirian & Sahraeian 
(2017; 2018) and Kumar et al. (2018; 2019).  
Further, there are inherent relationships between the projects. These interrelationships between the projects are 
known as interdependencies. There are three types of interdependencies defined in the literature namely: 
resource, benefit and technical (Aaker & Tyebjee, 1978; Fox et al., 1984) out of which technical 
interdependencies are most common which can be further divided into two types. One is mutual exclusiveness

5. Conclusion 
This paper considers the integrated problem of selection and scheduling of the interdependent projects. Two 
types of interdependencies among projects-mutual exclusiveness and complementariness are considered. The 
most beneficial projects are selected in the portfolio and are scheduled simultaneously. The total expected 
benefit is considered as the objective function to be optimized. The benefits from the projects are considered to 
be time-dependent. The problem is formulated in the form of a 0-1 integer program. A modified genetic 
algorithm (GA) is developed, and performance is compared with the Tabu Search (TS) algorithm existing in the 
PPSSP literature. Both the algorithms are evaluated on a set of 15 randomly generated test problems with 
varying complexity. The results show that proposed GA outperforms the TS algorithm in 10 test problems out of 
the total 15 problems generated in this study.  
As a major contribution of this work, the developed algorithm promises a potential solution approach to tackle 
the large and real life project selection problems faced by various organizations. For future research, the 
problem can be extended to consider the multiple objective and dynamic selection and scheduling of projects.

Abstract 
Nowadays, small to medium size automobile and electronic parts manufacturing factories intend to improve their 
Logistics Performance in conjunction with improve production process and products development for response 
customer service level and get competition opportunities. For this reason, this research selects one medium size 
automobile and electronic parts manufacturing factory in Thailand to be case study. There are 239 active Stock 
Keeping Units (SKUs) which be sold to customers. The concerned issue was “cannot deliver products to customer on 
the first request date and time” caused from spent long time for picking at finished goods warehouse. After observation 
and analyst data, found that there was mixed SKUs in some locations, some was empty meanwhile there were 18 
pallets on the floor and location utilization was 61.31%.  This research aims to design new storage strategy and develop 
initial program with using Visual Basic Application (VBA) for support all processes.  The results after adjust storage 
strategy from Fixed Location to Random Location under Fixed Zone and develop initial program which can decrease 
picking process time by 3.93 minutes per order and increase location utilization by 23.21% moreover can increase 
space worthiness ratio which compare between warehouse rental cost and actual active locations.

1. Introduction
In the past, the starter businesses of automobile and electronic parts manufacturing factories in Thailand which
focus on quality improvement or production process improvement or new products development from new technology 
which can be said that they generally intend about manufacturing on the other hand quality and new products. In the 
present, Supply Chain and Logistics Management is the one factor which be important for response customer service 
level and get competition opportunities in the present. Therefore, this research focuses on Logistics performance 
improvement in Automobile and Electronic Parts Manufacturing Industry. 
This research selects one of medium size automobile and electronic parts manufacturing factory in Rayong 
Province of Thailand to be the case study which has operated for 10 years. There are 239 active Stock Keeping Units 
(SKUs) of finished goods which be sold to customers. The essential customers are Car Assembly Plants and Electrical 
Appliance Factories. Manufacturing environment in this case study is “Make to Stock (MTS)” that produces based on 
demand forecasts therefore every process must be done on the schedule starts from receive forecasting quantity from 
customer after that do production plan then produces till puts away at specific location in the finished goods warehouse 
for waiting the customers pick up products according to their order on the appointment date and time.   The concerned 
big issue was “cannot deliver products to customer on the first request date and time” caused from spent long time for 
pick products at finished goods warehouse before delivery and there are not track and trace system for support all 
activities in warehouse. After observation, found that there was mixed SKUs in some locations so this was the causes 
that why spent the long time for picking. Moreover, there was some empty locations in spite of there were 18 pallets 
which are mixed SKUs and customer code on the floor therefore location utilization was 61.31%. 
This research aims to design new storage strategy for supports this manufacturing environment and responses to 
customer requirement which change from Fixed Location to Random Location under Fixed Zone and develop initial 
program with using Visual Basic Application (VBA) for support all processes in the finished goods warehouse.  The 
results after adjust storage strategy to be Random Location under Fixed Zone can increase location utilization from

5.3 Output information   
This developed initial program is the small system for the real-time stock movement for monitoring and 
controlling in addition to provide finished goods inventory or stock report.   
 
6. Conclusion  
In the development phase (Phase 2) of this research, there are three main steps thus ABC classification by each 
customer name for determine minimum quantity, maximum quantity and numbers of location by SKUs of each 
customer name after that design new storage strategy as “Random Location under Fixed Zone”  Finally, design and 
develop initial program for support all activities in finished goods warehouse The results after implementation which 
can decrease picking process time by 3.93 minutes per order and increase location utilization by 23.21%.  In addition 
to can increase space worthiness ratio which compare between warehouse rental cost (rental cost per year in Thai 
Baht) and actual active locations by 27.47%.

Abstract 
The occurrence of adverse events (AEs) is one of the most prevailing issues in the healthcare industry. Adverse events 
in hospitals are unintentional errors from clinical procedures or clinical decisions that can lead to serious complications 
or even death of a patient. There are several contributing factors to AEs which may include patient safety culture 
among medical practitioners, work environment, and technology, among others. The study aims to develop a 
framework that evaluates and prioritizes the factors contributing to adverse events in the Philippine hospitals. The 
Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used to establish the contributory factors and sub-factors in the 
occurrence of adverse events. The results show that technology, with a rating of 19.32%, is the main factor that should 
be prioritized by hospitals in the Philippines followed by institutional context and workforce condition with ratings of 
15.95% and 15.11%, respectively. Experts from both private and public hospitals are considered in the study. Findings 
show that there is only minimal differences on the responses from both set of experts. For instance, institutional context 
ranks second on the first set of experts whereas on the second set of experts, it ranks last.

1. Introduction
The severity of adverse events has long been recognized as early as the 1950s and 1960s, but the degree to which they 
are managed and overseen has not been significantly studied not until a number of evidences have surfaced in the mid 
1990’s in which Harvard Medical Practice Study published results regarding the occurrence of these events in 1991 
(World Health Organization, 2002). More researches were done regarding the prevalence of adverse events in the 
healthcare system such as in Northern Ireland, Australia, United Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States of 
America. In these studies, the earliest method used to detect adverse events was medical records review according to 
Thomas, Studdert and Brennan (2002). However, this method was deemed costly and time-consuming because 
physicians and hospital staff are required to constantly update and review records. Specifically, in the year 1999 the 
Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the United States started to give light to the adverse events and published the report 
entitled “To Err is Human - Building a Safer Health Care System”. 
This report first showed the real score of adverse events in the healthcare setting in which it highlighted that deaths 
occurring from such adverse events (98,000) outnumbered the deaths from accidents (43,000), cancer (32,000) and 
AIDS (16,000).  IOM, in their report, referred to two medical records reviews in which they identified adverse events 
and analyze whether these events are preventable. This report then sparked worldwide debates and call for more 
attention in taking a serious look in reducing the occurrence of adverse events in the hospitals worldwide through 
more researches. 
WHO (2002) indicated that adverse events occur in various settings, but most cases happen in hospitals since incidence 
associated with health care are high, procedures for development are better reported, and the significance of patient 
trust is foremost. Identification and reduction of adverse events is a complex and difficult task because it requires 
broad clinical learning, satisfactory documentation, and subjectivity with respect to the researcher (Thomas & 
Peterson, 2003). The impacts of the reduction of adverse events are improved patient safety and quality care (Kohn, 
988",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

The factors and sub-factors contributing the occurrence of adverse events in the Philippine hospitals have shown to 
be a complex field of study. Given this, the researchers have geared towards the development of a framework that 
could further help in the continuous improvement of hospitals in the Philippines, specifically on addressing the issues 
of adverse events. To do this, the researchers used the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) in the prioritization 
of factors and sub-factors contributing to the occurrence of adverse events in Philippine hospitals. In this approach, 
the factors and sub-factors were weighed and ranked which can be used for policy-making in hospitals, project 
assessment as well as in assessing risks. Technology (19.32%) is the main factor that should be prioritized by hospitals 
in the Philippines followed by Institutional Context (15.95%) and Workforce Condition (15.11%) as the second and 
third most influential factor. On the other hand, Working Methods (10.81%) and Patient Characteristics (10.63%) 
were the least contributing factor to the occurrence of adverse events.  
 
Validation of results was also added in the study to make sure that the framework developed can be used by hospitals 
in the Philippines which was done by having another set of experts. The implication of the results validation shows 
that the framework developed in this study is useful for developing policies on how to reduce occurrence of adverse 
events in Philippine hospitals. In addition, there are only minimal differences between the results of the initial and 
final validation answered by two different sets of experts. Technology (31.98%) is still the most contributing factor in 
the occurrence of adverse events in Philippine hospitals. There is a disparity between the second priority of the first 
and second set of experts wherein Institutional Context ranked last in the second set while it ranked second in the first 
set of experts. These differences in rankings can be further studied and analyzed by future researchers. 
 
Through validation and sensitivity analysis, the developed framework in this study showed that it is consistent and 
reliable; however, there are still improvements that can be done in the study. First, future researches can make use of 
larger sample size of experts in order to obtain better results. In addition, researchers could also explore the possibility 
of expanding the use of Fuzzy AHP with the application of other tools like Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation 
Laboratory (DEMATEL) which could further address the issue of dependencies of the factors since the researchers of 
this study only made the best effort in order to avoid dependencies; therefore, the authors have only assumed criteria 
independence. Future researches could also explore the use of other multi-criteria decision methods to tests if the same 
results can be generated.

Abstract 
Today businesses are dealing in a competitive global structure and thus, force them to be more focused on their every 
strategy followed in supply chain management in order to be more competitive and successful. As a consequence, 
reverse logistics has captured the attention of the businesses in order to improve the customer satisfaction and to 
improve the supply chain performance. It’s a proven fact that reengineering business processes of supply chains pave 
the way for improving efficiency and productivity of the supply chains. Accordingly, this scrutiny is to find out the 
effect of business process reengineering on the reverse logistics process of businesses and thereby how it affects for 
the supply chain performance. This study presents the findings of a comprehensive and systematic review of literature 
and subsequently presents a conceptual framework for the methods used in reengineering the reverse logistics and 
how it affects the supply chain performance. The article will provide an insight to current state of knowledge available 
in the respective area and will set up the path for future research.

1. Introduction
Reverse Logistics (RL) has gained increasing attention in recent years as a channel for companies to attain operational 
performance. It involves handling of returned materials or products which holds a major point in sustainable 
development throughout the whole supply chain. For better control and management of these activities new 
approaches and information support systems have to be proposed with a new organizational system. Thus, process re-
engineering may need to be carried out where it requires a careful and detailed strategic planning. (Chan, 2010) 
However, the product returns/RL are heavily driven by the customer returns and vary in volume according to the 
industry. 
The generally accepted definition of Reverse Logistics is “the process of planning, implementation and controlling 
the efficient, cost-effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods and related information from 
the point of consumption to the point of origin for the purpose of recapturing or creating value or proper disposal” 
(Rogers & Tibben-Lembke, 1999).  Reverse Logistics has become one of the most significant trends in supply chain 
management through the recognition of the strategic importance of reverse logistics operations, which can contribute 
for 5-6% of the total logistics costs (Retzlaff-Roberts and Frolick, 1997; Handfield & Nichols, 1999; Daugherty et al. 
2001).  
Reverse logistics operations in general can be quite difficult to manage. There are some specific challenges for better 
supervision of reverse logistics operations for product returns. Not only does a retailer have to effectively manage the

for the seller and the fourth party 
logistics provider.  
  
(Serrato et al. 2007)  
Markov Decision Model  
• To evaluate the decision to 
outsource   
 
A step by step approach was proposed by (Chan, 2010) for reengineering the reverse logistic process. This approach 
consists of six steps as defining the objectives of the reengineering project, identifying the potential improvement 
areas, understanding the whole logistics process and view it from a process point of view, developing manageable 
solutions for the potential improvement, evaluating the alternatives from the whole process point of view and finalize 
the decision, and implementing the new design. At the end of each step, a set of questions will be given. Its idea is to 
help people realize the critical issues in each step and ensure that the requirements are fulfilled before they move on. 
According to  (Chan, 2010)  both suppliers and customers can use this model and can incorporate business process 
reengineering into their reverse logistics process to achieve greater performance and higher customer satisfaction. This 
collaborative approach can be used to implement more effective and sustainable designs and methods. Also, critical 
analysis of the process can lead to find the hidden opportunities for potential cost savings.  
 
(Goldsby and Closs, 2000) proposed a model based on Activity based Costing (ABC).  ABC is a tool used by managers 
to estimate the ``true costs'' of operations more carefully. This approach illustrates an actual application of ABC to 
reverse logistics activities performed across supply chain organizations. Here, the approach is explained using a case 
study of a beverage distributor and retailer that collect empty beverage containers for recycling purposes. The case 
study demonstrates the ABC application in detail and discusses the reengineering of supply chain-wide processes 
resulting from the analysis. (Goldsby & Closs, 2000) 
 
(Mukhopadhyay & Setaputra, 2006) proposed a model for the 4PL as an integrator of reverse logistics. The researchers 
have model the problem as a game and develop closed form solutions for the optimum strategies both for the seller 
and outsourcing the reserve logistics and for the 4PL. The optimum results obtained from the model are stated in the 
paper in terms of the market parameters. This study also derived a number of insights into how a manager can influence 
these parameters using marketing and operational strategy variables to obtain the desired optimum values for the 
decision variables and get the benefit of a ripple effect to increase their profits. 
(Serrato et al. 2007) presents a Markov decision model to explore the hypothesis that outsourcing reverse logistics 
functions is more suitable when returns are more variable. It considered several elements that are critical in defining 
the characteristics of an reverse logistics network, such as the uncertainty in the return volume, the length of the 
product life cycle, the sales behavior, the particular reverse logistics  costs incurred, and the length of time defined for 
the existence of that reverse logistics system. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Recently growing research interest towards the importance of reverse logistics have made an enormous contribution 
on this subject. Based on the review and the analysis of the articles, some broad suggestions for future research can 
be derived.  Despite of the significant development achieved on this research area over the past decade, there remain 
many important issues for future investigation. 
 
Reverse logistics could be a value adding operation if it is properly managed. It has a significant effect on the supply 
chain performance. According to the reviewed studies, reverse logistics operation can be reengineered by outsourcing, 
building collaborative relationships with the supply chain partners and through information technology integration.  
Outsourcing the reverse logistics function to firms those who have the expertise knowledge to handle these operations 
will result a properly managed reverse logistics operation. Effective information sharing and resource sharing plays a 
prominent role in reverse logistics and collaborative relationships and partnerships with the supply chain partners as 
well as the other industry actors will pave the way for a well-organized operation. Information technology enabled 
reverse logistics will be very efficient, easy to manage and will provide real time information to the organizations.  
Highly optimized efficient and effective reverse logistics will improve the supply chain visibility of the firm. At the 
same time, having an organized process to manage the market returns will improve the customer satisfaction and the

loyalty. This will also help for the customer retention. An optimized reverse logistics operation ensures the proper 
disposal of waste matter and this will help the firm to build an image as an environmental friendly sustainable 
organization. This will aid in branding and will help to gain a competitive advantage over other rivalries. Firms can 
also resale and recycle the returned products and can earn a profit through scrap sales. Adding the products with 
damaged packaging and the returned unsold products will reduce the cost of producing new products and this will 
leads to efficient resource handling. Thus, supply chain performance of an organization can be significantly improved 
by optimizing the reverse logistics through reengineering.  
 
The conceptual framework shown in the Figure 2 illustrates the findings of the study. 
 
Figure 2. Conceptual Framework developed based on findings 
 
 
Most of the reviewed studies were concentrated on transportation function. Very few of the researchers have focused 
their attention on other logistics operations like warehousing, in reverse logistics. Only few studies were conducted to 
identify the relationship between business process re-engineering and reverse logistics. Therefore, it is essential to 
conduct more studies on this area due to the fact that the reverse logistic is a key area which can achieve higher supply 
chain performance through re-engineering. Most of the companies are transforming to visionary organizations in order 
to face the high competitiveness in the market and to sustain in the industry, and such organizations which are having 
a clear vision of the future should conjoin optimized reverse logistics operation to their business functions. So, they 
are targeting on innovative ways to reduce cost and improve services through reverse logistics, and hence, it would be 
necessary to conduct research on finding new ways to optimize reverse logistics through re-engineering the existing 
processes. Researchers should focus their attention to identify new trends in the reverse logistics and innovative ways 
to improve the supply chain performance through re-engineering reverse logistics.

Abstract 
In this research, we formulate a mathematical model to obtain elevator operating index, especially average 
waiting time. The users generated on each floor of the building installed elevator will occur with the Poisson 
distribution and the service time by the elevator will be the Exponential distribution. Given these, we create a 
mathematical model that calculates average wait time and elevator operating index based on queue and stochastic 
process. Then, we compare the operation index by computer simulation with the value obtained by the model. It will 
be given these, we create a mathematical model that calculates average wait time and elevator operating index based 
on queue and stochastic process. Then, we compare the operation index by computer simulation with the value 
obtained by the model.

Abstract 
Optimization of personnel scheduling is necessary to acquire labor schedules precisely and efficiently and finally it 
can directly reduce the cost of the project. The purpose of this research is to produce an optimal personnel 
scheduling in verification activities in order to reduce delays in project completion and determination of the optimal 
labor with a case study of verification activities in upstream oil and gas sector. Mathematical model approach is used 
to obtain optimal labor schedule. The result is confimed that mathematical model can be used to perform the 
optimization of personnel scheduling to minimize delay in the completion of work and analyze personnel 
requirements for each period of time either weekly or monthly.

1. Introduction
Manpower Planning is a two-phased process because manpower planning not only analyses the current human 
resources but also makes manpower forecasts and thereby draw employment programmes (Makwana et al. 2012). 
Manpower Planning is advantageous to firm in following manner (Makwana et al. 2012): (1) shortages and 
surpluses can be identified so that quick action can be taken wherever required; (2) all the recruitment and selection 
programmes are based on manpower planning;  (3) it also helps to reduce the labour cost as excess staff can be 
identified and thereby overstaffing can be avoided; (4) it also helps to identify the available talents in a concern and 
accordingly training programmes can be chalked out to develop those talents; (5) it helps in growth and 
diversification of business. Through manpower planning, human resources can be readily available and they can be 
utilized in best manner; (6) it helps the organization to realize the importance of manpower management. 
Based on solution method used, personnel scheduling can be classified into severall types. The Personnel scheduling 
solution methods is classified in two categories (Bergh et al. 2013): (1) linear programming; (2) construction based. 
Gonzalves et al. (2004) made classification from different approach where the solution of personnel scheduling is 
divided into five groups: (a) Demand modeling; (b) Artificial Intelligence Approach (fuzzy set theory, searchand 
expert systems); (c) Constraint programming; (d) Metaheuristics; and (e) mathematical Programming Approach. In 
the last few decades, personnel scheduling problems have been studied widely. The increase in research attention 
could be motivated by economic considerations. For many companies, labor cost is the major direct cost component. 
Cutting this cost by only a few percent by implementing a new personnel schedule could therefore prove very 
beneficial (Bergh et al. 2013). Bergh et al. (2013) conducted a research by reviewing and analyzing ± 300 research 
related to man power. The study is indentified those researches from various perspectives then analyzed them. In his 
research, it also classified those personnel schedulling researches into some categories based on Personnel

Table 2 shows that the minimum optimal number of personnel needed to conduct verification is 8 persons 
(December), while the maximum optimal number of personnel is 20 persons,  meanwhile the largest number of 
optimal personnel is 20 people (October). Based on the data above and it can be concluded that for the verification 
activity period of July to December the minimum number of personnel needed to work on project is 8 persons, while 
the maximum number of personnel needed is 20 persons. This minimum number of personnel can be a reference on 
determining how many personnel needed to conduct local content verification. Based on the data above, the number 
of permanent personnel who can be hired to work on the project is 8 people. While the personnel requirements for 
other months can use contract labor. Another factor to be considered in the recruitment of personnel is educating of 
the personnel because recruited personnel are not always directly ready and able to carry out verification activities 
technically and scientifically. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Personnel scheduling optimization by using approach of mathematical model is capable of providing optimal 
personnel scheduling, reduces the amount of manpower delays and can be used to analyze the needs of labor based 
on the number of existing projects. Analysis of optimal personnel needs is performed by taking into account the 
trend of the number of verification projects and average speed factor of the educating time of each personnel.  
 
Mathematical model resulted can be further developed by considering the cost of contract personnel recruitment and 
penalty cost due to delay in project finishing. The delay in completing the verification work is not only caused by 
the lack of personnel number or poor personnel scheduling but also is influenced by other factors such as late 
submission of documents by the subject of verification. Therefore, these factors should be minimized by creating a 
standard procedure regulating the procedures for verification, and verification stages and implementation time for 
each stage of verification.

Abstract 
Oil and gas are a strategic natural resources, not only as a source of state revenue, supplier of fuel needs 
of domestic and industrial raw materials, but it is also expected to be able to create a chain effect for 
enhancing national capacity. Therefore we need a strategy to exploit the opportunities created by the oil 
and gas industry to support this effort. Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to get the weights of criteria 
and sub-criteria and then rank the performance improvement strategy against Local Content Achievement 
by using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. Structured interviews with 
experts in the field of Local Content in the upstream oil and gas business activities has been conducted. 
The result is twelve criteria relating to the success of the performance improvement of Local Content 
achevement in the upstream oil and gas business activities. There are sixteen strategies that affect and 
after the ranking of the most influential strategy is the role of government in setting the focus of scientific 
fields of applied sciences to the population and to develop human resources in accordance with the 
current needs of the global market in the medium and high skill level.

1. Introduction
As strategic natural resources, Petroleum and Natural Gas (PNG) play important role in national economy, as state 
income, domestic fuel demand, and industrial raw material. Therefore, the strategy is necessary to use the 
opportunity from the PNG Industrythat capable to create chain effect for increasing national capacity and economic 
growth. One of the strategy is the state must enact local content policy, which will stimulate the development of 
manufacture and industry capacity. Local PNG Industry must be able to compete with foreign supplier company, so 
when the natural source is ran out the company still be able to exist. 
Local content policy should capable to contribute maximally for elevating national economic growth. The 
development of local industry requires domestic resource, especially skilled labor. Local content is defined as value 
that acquired from procurement of good and service, including fee, profit, material, equipment, manufacture, sub-
contractor and taxes in national economy (Warner, 2011). The local content has direct impact in creating local jobs 
and indirect impact to the supplier. The result can be seen from the amount of local supplier to meet the demand of 
good and service procurement.

the hierarchy analysis result in assessment criteria and the weighting of each criterion has done an assessment of 
each strategy, become the input data for the calculation method of TOPSIS. The principle of TOPSIS method is to 
select the alternative that has the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and the farthest distance from the 
negative ideal solution. The role of government in determining the focus of scientific fields populated into applied 
science and to develop human resources in accordance with the current needs of the global market in the medium 
level and high skill have relative closeness of the greatest among other things that make it a top rank strategy. The 
overflow of imported labor will dominate the field of medium-skilled and high-skilled in Indonesia, will potentially 
trigger social conflicts with local workers are only used in the low-skilled field. 
 
One of the factors which is driving the growth of the Indonesian industry is the availability of excellent and 
productive human resources. With the availability of qualified labor, will support the development of Indonesia's 
economy and improve the nation's ability to compete in the field of knowledge-based industries. Therefore, the role 
of the government to determine the focus of scientific fields of applied sciences to the population and to develop 
human resources in accordance with the current needs of the global market in the medium and high skill levels are 
considered to represent the best strategy in a Local Content performance improvement in the upstream oil and gas 
activities. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
This study concludes that the most influential alternative strategy in achieving local content in upstream oil and gas 
business activities is the role of the government in setting the focus of the scientific field of its population to applied 
science and building human resources according to the current needs of the global market at medium and high skill 
levels. Further studies should be implemented, especially to the proposals of the current strategy, the main 
constraints and possible changes in setting strategy for improving the performance of Local Content in the upstream 
oil and gas activities in Indonesia.

Abstract 
An effective combination of highly innovative logistics infrastructure plays a vital role in every business activity as a 
strategy of achieving competitive advantage. Currently, warehousing has been identified as one of the foremost value 
adding activities in supply chains. In the warehousing industry, automated intralogistics systems would be an ideal 
solution to eliminate the inefficiencies in conventional practices as well as to overcome the labour shortage issue. 
With the emergent trend of technology adaptation in industries, it is evident that Sri Lanka has the capability to apply 
these technologies up to a certain extent. Therefore, discovering the opportunities of logistics 4.0 implementation in 
Sri Lankan warehousing industry is highly demanding. This scrutiny has been conducted using a comprehensive and 
systematic review of literature published in relation to the areas of smart warehousing, smart logistics, intralogistics 
and Sri Lankan Third Party Logistics (3PL) industry. Through the effective categorization and integrative analysis, 
this paper intends to identify the ways of warehousing process improvements using the logistics 4.0 technologies while 
achieving the operational excellence. Further, it is expected to suggest the critical success factors affecting the logistics 
4.0 implementation from the perspective of Sri Lankan 3PL warehousing Industry. 
Keywords: Logistics 4.0, Smart Logistics, Smart Warehouse, Intralogistics, Third Party Logistics (3PL) 
1. Introduction
Warehousing has been a foremost element of modern supply chains as a competitive strategy to improve 
organizational performance. The role of warehouse has been changing over recent years since the prominence has 
been placed on customer satisfaction and visibility of the supply chain. With the competitive market conditions and 
the dynamic customer demands, it has been difficult to meet the requirements with the traditional warehouse 
management approaches, due to their complexity and low efficiency. As a result of the fourth industrial revolution in 
the context of warehousing, Smart logistics and Smart warehouse concepts have been evolving all over the world in 
order to eliminate the drawbacks of the conventional warehouse systems. Although these concepts have been widely 
spread around the world; in the Sri Lankan business context it is still in its infancy. In Sri Lanka, most of the 
warehousing operations are more labor-intensive, however the labour shortage issue would be a potential challenge in 
the near future. Therefore, the digitization would be an effective strategy to minimize human intervention in 
warehousing operations and to enhance the productivity of the available labour force. Hence, exploring the 
opportunities of logistics 4.0 implementation in Sri Lankan warehousing industry is highly demanding. 
With the emerging trend of outsourcing logistics functions, third-party logistics providers play a vital role in the 
warehousing industry. Most of the Sri Lankan companies also tend to outsource their warehousing functions to third-
party logistics providers with the purpose of enhancing their supply chain performance. According to a survey 
conducted by Hettiarachchi & Ranwala (2015), it has been proved that the warehousing is the most commonly 
outsourced logistics function in Sri Lanka. Therefore, identifying the role of logistics 4.0 applications in improving 
warehouse performance and identifying the critical factors affecting the logistics 4.0 implementation are important in 
the 3PL warehousing industry.

4. Discussion 
 
The reviewed studies on smart logistics & smart warehouse have significantly deliberated the sophisticated logistics 
4.0 technologies with the industrial applications highlighting their influences in process improvements. Most of the 
high end countries have successfully implemented these smart systems and these technology adoptions have 
drastically renovated their industrial environment providing massive benefits to the all stakeholders. According to the 
reviewed studies, most of intralogistics functions in warehousing such as unloading, put away, storing, picking, 
sorting, packing and loading have been automated through the integration of information and material handling 
technologies enabled with logistics 4.0. 
 
In the modern business domain, Outsourcing the selected logistics functions to a third party has become a common 
practice. The major benefit among this strategic decision includes, the ability of a company to focus on its core 
competencies concentrating its resources on them, while expert care is given to the non-core activities. Most of the 
Sri Lankan companies also tend to outsource their warehousing functions to the third party logistics providers with 
the purpose of enhancing their supply chain performance. Therefore, the 3PL providers play a vital role in the current 
context of warehousing industry.  When literature is reviewed, a limited number of studies were found on Sri Lanka’s 
3PL industry. Those studies have mainly discussed on the challenges and drawbacks in the traditional practices and 
stressed the importance of exploring the opportunities of technology adoption. It is stated that the Sri Lankan 3PL 
market is yet to achieve maturity. As a developing country, the major challenge that has been faced in implementing 
the digital technologies is whether the country has enough resources and competencies to adopt them successfully. 
Therefore, these studies have emphasized the importance of future research in this area. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
There is no hesitation that the logistics performance adds value to the entire supply chain in the organization. 
Companies have identified logistics as one of key success factors in obtaining competitive advantage. Outsourcing 
the logistics functions to a third party has become a common practice in the corporate world. Therefore, the 3PL 
service providers perform a vital role in the current context of Sri Lankan Logistics sector and they have become the 
experts in providing a wide range of services such as warehousing services, transportation services, inventory 
management, shipping etc. Hence, the 3PL service providers make a significant contribution to the country’s economy, 
because they allow most of the organizations to achieve their goals through enhancing the performance of their supply 
chains. Nonetheless, these 3PL firms have been encountering some major challenges due to the lack of some 
capabilities. One such critical challenge is the labour shortage.  
 
The digitization will be an effective strategy to overcome above challenge to minimize human intervention and 
enhance the output of the available labour force. In this study, the attention has been mainly focused on the 
intralogistics processes of warehousing. Optimization of the warehousing operations is becoming challenging for the 
3PL firms to cope up with the dynamic customer demand and market features.  The application of logistics 4.0 
concepts in to the intra-logistics processes would be an ideal solution to overcome these issues. It is evident that there 
is a possibility to foster digitization in Sri Lanka by promoting digital infrastructure, investing and stimulating 
professional training and promoting the creation of specific funding lines and etc. “Industry 4.0-related opportunities 
and challenges have a significant influence on its tendency towards implementation” (Müller, Kiel and Voigt 2018). 
Based on the content analysis of the above reviewed studies, technology related opportunities and challenges can be

identified in the context of Sri Lankan 3PL industry. According to analysis, few critical success factors affecting the 
logistics 4.0 implementation have been identified, such as Aligning with competitive strategies, Top Management 
Commitment, Comprehensive Change Management Process, Strategic Workforce Planning, Synchronization and 
Coordination with existing business processes and Effective Financial Investments. 
 
There is a high necessity of conducting research on these areas to explore the opportunities of adopting the evolving 
advanced technologies. As the future work, it is expected to conduct an empirical study on 3PL warehousing for 
assessing Industry 4.0 readiness based on a capability maturity model. The result of this study would provide useful 
information for Sri Lankan 3PL providers to develop their capabilities to cope with the dynamic requirements in the 
feature.

Abstract 
Recent studies of warehouse layout designs show that the travel distance for order-picking operations can be reduced 
by changing the angle of the cross aisles in the traditional warehouse layout. Thus, in this study, a new design idea is 
proposed to search for better layouts for order-picking operations than traditional two-block layouts. For this, two 
angled cross aisles are allowed to intersect in the middle of the storage area. A new constructive aisle model is 
developed so as to evaluate all possible layouts that can be generated in this problem. In order to calculate order 
picking tour length for a given number of visits, one of the best known metaheuristics algorithm called Ant Colony 
Optimization algorithm is used. Next, Differential Evolution algorithm is used to explore the best values of the design 
variables to minimize average order-picking tour length for a given number of orders. Last, it was shown that two-
block layouts are superior to the best-found designs with two angled and intersected cross aisles under the considered 
design assumptions in this study.

1. Introduction
Increasing online sales have been reshaping supply chain network of retail stores and operations in their warehouses. 
Customers may request one pencil or one AC from online stores. Considering the variety of products, their sizes and 
units that are requested by online customers, order-picking operation in warehouses has been increasingly playing an 
important role to provide competitive advantage to companies because customers expect to receive their orders quick 
and accurate. Thus, warehouse managers highlight that order-picking accuracy and order-cycle time are two of the 
important key performance metrics for managing warehouses efficiently (Warehousing Educational and Resource 
Council, 2018). For these metrics, order-picking operation is regarded as the most critical warehouse operation 
because it causes 60% of the total cycle time and 50% of the total operational cost (Frazelle and Frazelle, 2002; De 
Koster, 2007; Bartholdi and Hackman, 2011) when it is compared to other major warehouse operations such as 
receiving, put-away and shipping.  
A typical order-picking operation requires order pickers to visit many locations to pick items in small quantities to 
fulfill customer orders. While managers perform several policies such as batching and product allocation to increase 
the order-picking operation’s efficiency in terms of travel time, its efficiency is also affected by the layout of the 
storage area, which unfortunately has been undervalued for a long time by researchers because it is known that when 
a warehouse is built it is very difficult and expensive to change it. Because of the importance of a warehouse layout, 
this study aims to search for whether a new layout is generated to improve order picking operation’s efficiency in 
warehouses.

Abstract 
 
For MSMEs to manage their growth – a micro enterprise becomes a business small, and from small businesses to 
become medium-sized businesses – they need platform that can trained them developing by themselves their business.  
This study aims at initiating building the platform model. As a start, this initiating model takes only “Pewayangan’ 
traditional Sundanese heritage puppet show as the model case. This case is chosen as a start to further understand the 
complexity of the multi-faceted business model that Jelekong possesses. In this study we define Jelekong business as:  
Social business where it caters for the ability for Jelekong communities to improve Jelekong village performance. 
Jelekong is a community of dancers, painters, puppet performers, and other art performers and creators/artists. Each 
of the endeavors performed by member of Jelekong fit into MSME business classification. The study reveals Business 
Model pattern that is specific to Jelekong: Talents (artists) producers as well as Arts and Performance Service 
Producer. The pattern is shown as a table of interactivity among nine Osterwalder’s static Business Model elements. 
In this study we find that Mobile phone (CR1), website (CR2), and social media (CR3) as well as community (CR4) 
are more attractive as customers’ channels. Web Developer [KP4] become enablers website [CR2] that will be used 
as Dalang communicates with his customers and provides complete information about the next or future performances. 
So far, Pewayangan is recognized only in a more cultural attached segment which invites Dalang to perform for 
specific event. The challenge for Dalang is to adapt himself to millennial generation. That will be a tough challenge.

1. Introduction 
 
Empowering Micro-Small-Medium Enterprise (MSME) is one of the chosen alternative behind the efforts of 
Government of Indonesia (GoI) to reduce unemployment, poverty and income inequality. The MSME business 
growth is facing at least two major obstacles, namely the capital and knowledge in operating the business and 
marketing. 
The capital factor has long been a concern of the GoI with various initiative solutions already in place, one of which 
solution is KUR (people's business loan). KUR that started in August 2015, has been rolling amounting to 4.356 
trillion rupiahs. That was also followed by the increase in absorption of labor in the same year: from 1.1 million 
labors absorbed by the market in 2014 to 1.3 million up to September 2015. (ksp, 2016) 
Behind the factors that play a role in fostering positive number of labors absorption by the growth of the MSME 
business, hidden stats that can describe failure. There has been no analysis that tells about the negative growth of

Abstract  
 
Medical Emergency Service (MES) is an important element in modern healthcare system. MES becomes 
important issue because it plays an important role in saving lives and reducing mortality and mordibility. 
The ability of MES to save lives depends on the time it takes for an ambulance to arrive on the scene after 
an emergency call received. This research will focus on changing the MES system from initially centralized 
to decentralized by considering the determination of the allocation and redeployment of ambulance. We 
propose the Nearest Neighbourhood – Symbiotic Organisms Search algorithm (NN-SOS) to overcome the 
problems. This study is expected to be able to solve the problems in the limitation of the number of 
ambulance required and the minimization of response time. From this study, it can be concluded that a 
decentralized ambulance system is needed. The comparison of the response time generated from the two 
systems is a centralized system with the best time limit having an average response time of 10-13 minutes 
while the decentralized system is better which is 3-6 minutes.

1. Introduction 
 
In medical emergency services, the response time is the interval between the arrival of the emergency call and the 
arrival of the medical team at the location of the call. This is a major concern because this delay may cause a difference 
between the patient's life and death, depending on the seriousness of his medical condition. MES managers must take 
operational and tactical decisions in this system to evaluate trade-offs between providing appropriate patient care 
(service level) and reducing costs associated with medical resources and capacity (ambulances, stations, specialties 
and equipment) (de Souza et al ., 2015). 
 
The performance of pre-hospital medical (MES) emergency services depends on existing transportation infrastructure 
and medical resources (limited and important). The ambulance response time is generally considered an important 
factor for the survival of MES patients. Especially for patients with urgent needs, the response time determines the 
mortality rate (Chen et al., 2016). One key factor in MES performance is the speed at which emergency vehicles can 
respond to incidents (McCormarck & Coates 2015). The main objective of MES is to save the lives of emergency

Based on Table 7, 8, 9 and Table 10, ambulance ordering with a decentralized system is faster than a centralized 
system. If an ambulance at any health facility can be used by a patient who does not distinguish between public or 
private health facility problems, then the patient will have many opportunities to obtain services from an ambulance. 
Table 10. serve the result when the parameter of time limit decrease into international standards of response time. The 
average of response time is decrease but the number of un-covered demands is increase. the lack of fleet for this 
scenario is the same as the 10-minute time limit scenario which is 3 until 10 fleet of ambulances.  
 
Based on parameter demand, ambulance ordering with a 5, 10 and 15 demands the system shows that there some 
demands can not served because the demands in out of covering area. There is a trade-off where if the goal is to meet 
all demands, the 15-minute deadline scenario is the best option in centralized system but with response time 
considerations that still exceed international response time standards. On the contrary if the goal is to meet 
international standards from the response time then the scenario that can be chosen is the 8.8 minute timeout scenario. 
With the consequence the system must add new locations as much as 4 - 7 stations and add 3 - 10 ambulance fleets. 
Thus confirming the statement from Takeda et al. (2007) decentralization will minimize response time but will 
increase investment and operational costs. 
 
From several scenarios have been carried out, a maximum time limit of 15 minutes can overcome almost all 
requests in centralized system. Experiments use parameters of the number of requests 5, 10 and 15 patients and time 
limit 20 minutes, 15 minutes, 10 minutes until 8,8 minutes. Afterwards, the average demand is not within the coverage 
area is only 1 patient. From the perspective of the amount to be allocated, the systems must add 1 fleet to fulfill the 
overall demand. So the average response time is approximately 13 minutes. Otherwise, to minimize response time can 
use the 8,8 minutes maximum covering time scenario and the response time becomes 6 - 8 minutes. The consequence 
is the existing system (centralized) need 11-12 stations and 15 unit ambulances to allocated to cover max 15 demands.  
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
From this study, it can be concluded that a decentralized ambulance system is needed. This is because it facilitates the 
request to get an ambulance. We cannot expect emergency conditions so that at least we can do prevention by using 
such solutions. To choose the best time limit that will be set as the standard of each system judging by how fast the 
response time is generated and how much the system is able to meet the demand. The best time limit for ambulances 
can serve patients on a centralized system, which is 15 minutes with an average speed of 50 minutes assuming nothing 
when heading to the destination, while the best time limit for a decentralized system is 8.8 minutes. The comparison 
of the response time generated from the two systems is a centralized system with the best time limit having an average 
response time of 10-13 minutes while the decentralized system is better which is 3-6 minutes.

Abstract 
Growing population along with technological advancement to pace the production speed like never before has raised 
alarming concerns and attracted attention globally. Circular Economy, a fairly new concept has emerged to address 
such issues by proposing a closed loop system in contrast to a linear system. While the concept of Circular Economy 
presents a great potential, there yet remain a challenge for its adaptation in the existing manufacturing sector, 
especially at SMEs level. Many new techniques, methods and models are being developed, many of which require a 
complete change in the existing system, which not only have capital requirements but also upskilling labour. For 
SMEs, it is challenging to have such transition due to higher capital and skills requirements. This research explores 
the possibility to combine the existing concept of Lean with Circular Economy for speedy and easy adaptation of 
Circular Economy principles within the manufacturing sector, especially at SMEs level. A novel conceptually 
developed framework is proposed to merge the vitality of Lean and Circular Economy.

1. Introduction
The distance between academia and industry is often lengthened due to the lack of comprehensive methodologies (e.g. 
frameworks) to implement the theory/concept (Chay et al., 2015). At the same time, the existing potential of earlier 
developed models is often ignored, and efforts/resources are wasted in re-inventing the wheel. Scholars do 
acknowledge that generally, the concepts do have massive potential to benefit its users, as in the case of Circular 
Economy (CE); but a major factor contributing to failure or ineffectiveness of a concept is the ill-defined 
implementation stage (Chay et al., 2015), despite investment of resources (Garza-Reyes et al., 2015). Thus, there is a 
strong need to have a systematically developed framework for the implementation of holistic sustainability principles 
proposed under the concept of CE, while benefiting from the strengths of the other models/concepts such as Lean. 
The two concepts of Lean and CE, have a greater synergy to benefit the manufacturing sector. Moreover, with their 
common elements to eliminate waste and create value, although with a different focus, complement each other in 
producing effective outcomes, therefore, their combination seems natural. The CE model presents an ideal solution to 
the current global problems of resource scarcity (Nadeem et al., 2017), environmental damages (van Loon et al., 2017) 
and to establish a closed-loop economic system (Webster, 2015). Lean on the other hand has been a proven success 
to eliminate waste and to create value (Mostafa et al., 2013) by achieving efficiency and the economic benefit.  
Yusof and Aspinwall (2000) describe that a model defines ‘what is’ and a framework defines ‘how to’. On a similar 
note, Anand and Kodali (2010) define a framework as the ‘guiding torch’ to manage the implementation of any 
change. Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop and present a comprehensive framework by integrating the 
best practices of the two concepts of Circular Economy (CE) and Lean, to allow the adoption of CE’s principles within 
the operations management of manufacturing sector, especially at SMEs level.  
With the above aim, the objective of this study is to integrate the best practices of both CE and Lean to develop a 
novel conceptual framework, providing a systematic approach with step-by-step guidance to manage and maintain 
CE’s adoption in the manufacturing sector especially at SMEs level; by utilising CE and Lean, tools and methods.  
With this scope, the remaining paper is structured in five sections of framework development methodology (2); 
principles of the framework (3); conceptual framework (4); conclusions, limitations and future research directions (5).

Abstract 
Because the formation or reformation of emergency logistics is a complex undertaking, this study proposes 
a multi-period location-routing model in the immediate aftermath of a flood natural disaster. The model can 
decide the temporary depot locations and make vehicle routing plans in which the amount of each relief 
supplies to be transported can be optimally determined. The temporary depot considered in this problem is 
a facility different from a typical warehouse on the fact that temporary depots are not set up to provide 
storage, but are created instead to facilitate transferring relief supplies from one carrier type to another 
carrier type at the flood boundary. The most common transport means used in the real flood problem, trucks 
and boats, are considered in the model formulation. We begin by explaining the proposed mixed-integer 
programming model which employs a dynamic approach to locate the temporary depots, after which we 
conduct a set of numerical experiments to test the model formulation and analyze the characteristics of the 
optimization problem. The experimental results indicate that, based on flood disaster characteristics, our 
model is capable of showing the optimal locations of temporary depots in the flood response operations.

1. Introduction
According to the International Disasters Database (EM-DAT, 2018), an average of 210 million people were affected 
yearly by weather-related disasters between 2007 and 2016. The frequency of geophysical disasters (earthquakes, 
tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and mass movements) remained broadly constant throughout this period, but a sustained 
rise in climate-related events (mainly floods and storms) pushed total occurrences significantly higher. EM-DAT data 
contained in a 2017 report by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) show that flooding 
caused the majority of disasters between 2007 and 2016, accounting for 41% of all recorded events and affecting 
nearly 85 million people each year. As recent events have proven, floods are the most common and most costly natural 
disasters. While it seems to be impossible to entirely prevent flood situations, steps can be taken to minimize injuries 
and losses and speed the recovery response process.  
The formation or reformation of emergency logistics following large-scale and catastrophic disasters is a complex 
undertaking. In such situations, established and improvised agencies frequently work alongside government 
organization, to instantly deliver relief supplies and services. It is expected more specifically to rescue lives, minimize

5. Conclusions 
The study extended the contribution focusing on the operational level in the immediate aftermath of a flood natural 
disaster. The location-routing model is proposed to the particular temporary depot problem regards to a multi-period 
approach. The model can decide the temporary depot locations and make vehicle routing plans in which the amount 
of each relief supplies to be transported can be optimally determined. The temporary depot considered in this problem 
is a facility different from a typical warehouse on the fact that temporary depots are not set up to provide storage, but 
are created instead to facilitate transferring relief supplies from one carrier type to another carrier type at the flood 
boundary. The most common transport means used in the real flood problem, trucks and boats, are considered in the 
model formulation. 
 
We demonstrate illustrative examples that present how the model formulation can be used to optimize the locations 
of temporary depots by the first three days of emergency response. More number of resources are able to provide 
better response that can complete the satisfaction faster than the small number of available resources. The proposed 
model shows the optimal locations of temporary depots for each time period regarding to demand in floods. The 
approach is referred as a valuable tool for the decision maker that suggest the plan for locating and relocating 
temporary facilities for each time period in order to provide the optimal response delivery. 
 
Though, there are a number of research expansion of this study, future research will seek for more complex and larger 
problems. The application of a heuristic algorithm is prospected to offer opportunities for better improvement when 
sizes and complexity of problem become greater. This can be expected to help finding proper and satisfactory solutions 
to problem processes.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to develop a framework for implementation of World-Class Manufacturing 
(WCM) in process industry which can guide and support for those process industries, aiming to start their 
journey to reach world-class standards in quality. World Class Manufacturing (WCM) includes various 
concepts, principles, policies and techniques for the management and operation of companies engaged in 
production in order to achieve competitive edge over competitors. The case study presented in this paper is 
from one of the India’s largest crop protection chemical company which has set a target of bagging Deming 
Prize in next 5 years through TQM. The organizations applying for Deming Prize should achieve a business 
success through quality improvements. The various tools of TQM such as policy management, daily work 
management, autonomous maintenance, and lean manufacturing are discussed. In order to implement WCM 
in a process industry, this study gives a broader overview of WCM through TQM. With the context of 
WCM implementation in a process industry, the study is considered to be valuable and useful to the 
practitioners.

1. Introduction
The term world-class manufacturing (WCM) captures the breadth and the essence of the fundamental changes taking 
place in industrial enterprises very well. This infers that the companies must critically examine the competitiveness 
of their manufacturing strategies to achieve the status of a world class manufacturer (Haleem et al., 2012). Becoming 
a WCM company is a goal of industries. Hence, many among them are trying to adopt a philosophy of WCM in their 
production processes to be the best in the world within their particular sector of industry. Literature suggests that the 
WCM is the best alternative for implementation and to achieve or maintain competitive advantages (Okhovot et al. 
2012; Fullerton et al., 2003). He further stated that the term WCM is applied for organizations that achieved a global 
competitive advantage through the use of their manufacturing capabilities. Firm should continue to demonstrate their 
excellence in manufacturing through dominance the world markets, to be called a world class manufacturer. 
Companies engaged in WCM implementation focus on improving operations, elimination of waste, managing

3.5. Improvement Management (IM) 
Continuous Improvement includes the application of quality assurance to every company activity and is characterized 
by the application of good practice . . . the attainment of continuously improving customer satisfaction (McAdam et 
al., 2000). There are two different approaches of improvement, kaikaku: revolutionary change and kaizen: 
evolutionary change. Kaizen also called as continuous improvement, which is the ongoing improvement of products, 
services or processes through incremental improvements. QC story has been proved as a powerful improvement 
management tool from the perspective of quality. Seven steps of problem solving type QC story are:  
i. 
Problem 
ii. 
Observation 
iii. 
Analysis 
iv. 
Action 
v. 
Check 
vi. 
Standardization 
vii. 
Conclusion 
 
3.6. Lean Manufacturing (LM) 
The philosophy of manufacturing pioneered by Toyota was termed as lean manufacturing by James Womack and 
Daniel Jones (1991) in the book The machine that changed the world. Lean manufacturing facilitates the production 
of artifacts in medium-to-large volume and a medium-to-large variety and hence enables to meet the requirements of 
a broad customer base. The basic concept of lean is to eliminate waste by addressing the material and information 
flow issues in a production system and makes it more efficient and competitive (Chaple et al. 2018a). Commonly 
referred wastes include overproduction, inventory, waiting, over-processing, transportation, motion and defects. 
Researchers have reported various benefits of lean manufacturing like, reduced waste, rework, space requirement, lot 
size, inventory, overhead cost and improved quality, motivation, process yields, productivity, flexibility and problem-
solving capabilities (Jayaram et al., 2008; Hofer et al., 2012).  
Within the process industry, chemical sector is under continuing pressure on the cost. However, lean has been the 
perfect strategy to apply to reduce cost. ‘Performance improvements across the whole supply chain supporting 
increased business performance’ is obvious offering of what ‘lean’ has to the process industries (Melton, 2005). 
LM is a multi-dimensional approach that encompasses a wide variety of management practices in an integrated system. 
Researchers have discussed a wide variety of lean practices in improving the business performance. Lean practices 
are those actions that focus on the reduction of waste and non-value-added activities (e.g. overproduction, inventory 
or any other factor) that can disrupt the swift-even flow of goods through the supply chain, from a firm’s internal 
manufacturing operations (Chaple et al., 2018b). 
 
3.7. Performance measures (PQCDSM) 
Performance measures are a metric used to quantify the efficiency and/or effectiveness of an action (Neely et al. 1995; 
Chaple et al. 2018a). Performance measures help in monitoring, achieving goals, benchmarking, and deciding 
strategies for corrective actions. It is reported that organizations that fail to measure the most critical areas for its 
success are less likely to achieve their strategic objectives. In measuring the benefits of implementing improvement 
initiatives, researchers have discussed a variety of performance measure, such as, productivity, quality, cost, delivery, 
safety and morale which are adopted to monitor improvements through WCM. 
 
4. Conclusions 
WCM is sustainable business excellence model driven by customer centric goals, people and partners. The case study 
presented in this paper intends to explain the implementation framework of World-Class Manufacturing (WCM) in 
process industry which can guide and support for those process industries, aiming to start their journey to reach world-
class standards in total quality management (TQM). The various tools of TQM were then summarized and explained, 
such as policy management, daily work management, autonomous maintenance, and lean manufacturing. In the 
context of WCM implementation in a process industry, the study is considered to be valuable and useful to the 
practitioners as it first 
a) Brings stability in processes and reduces variations, then 
b) Takes system and processes to next level applying SDCA- PDCA cycle continuously, and overall 
c) Profitable business goal achievement as the effect of robust system and processes.

Abstract 
Natural gas is the most important indigenous source of energy that has been continuously produced and consumed in 
significant quantities since 19470.About 75% of the commercial energy of the country comes from the natural gas. 
So far 27 gas fields have been discovered of which two of the gas fields are located in offshore area. The paper 
shows the dependency of Bangladesh on gas alone and negligence on other resources like coal, solar, wind, biomass 
etc. Though Bangladesh has considerable amount of gas yet it is not enough for 50 more years at current demand 
and extraction rate. The analysis suggests to reduce dependency on natural gas by introducing alternative energy 
sources. Moreover, a comprehensive energy policy should be developed with a proper regulatory body that has 
oversight responsibilities. Efficient gas marketing is the key to derive numerous benefits from the gasreserves of 
Bangladesh. Lastly, Bangladesh government need to explore ocean area that has been acquired from India & 
Myanmar in 2014. 
1. Introduction
Though the serious attempt to find oil and natural gas started in the first decade of previous century, the first gas 
field discovery was made by Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) in 1955 at Haripur. But the rapid expansion and 
integration of petroleum companies started to accelerate in the early 1970s spurred by the rising oil prices. The last 
(26th) discovery was in Roopganj (Narayanganj) in June, 2014.Natural gas is the most important fuel for 
Bangladesh, both in terms of energy and diversity of use. Natural gas burns more cleanly than other fuels, such as oil 
and coal, and produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy released. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning 
natural gas produces about 30% less carbon-dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45% less than burning 
coal.Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Resources Corporation, Petrobangla, is entrusted with the responsibilities of 
the gas and coal sectors of Bangladesh. Subsidiaries under Petrobangla are responsible for exploration, production, 
transmission, distribution and marketing of natural gas to the end users.In 1993, there were 17 gas fields in the 
country with an estimated total initial gas reserve of 12.43 TCF and remaining reserves of 10.55 TCF. In 2003, the 
number of gas fields was 22 and the total initial gas reserve was estimated at 20.51 TCF and a remaining reserve of 
15.4 TCF. In 2014, the number of gas fields grew to 26 with an estimated initial gas reserve of 26.84 TCF and a 
remaining reserve of 16.74 TCF. In 2016, remaining gas reserve is 12.88 TCF [1]. Bangladesh also has good amount 
of coal along with natural gas as its main resources reserved in its territory. But the extensive portion of the demand 
is met by gas alone and it is about 75% of the total consumptions.

negative environmental effect. Stakeholders of coal are tied up with wide-range of controversies since ages from 
extraction to power generation technology. So far Bangladesh has only one state-owned coal power project with 
capacity of 250 MW whereas 40% of global power generation is sourced from coal which accounts for 22% of Co2 
emission [31]. 
 
Bangladesh is importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet extra demand of energy. LNG can be a great source of 
clean energy. However, there are questions about the investment required in the LNG import and distribution 
network, cost of LNG at the consumer levels etc. Impact of cost increase is already being felt by people as 
government recently has increased the price of electricity. The government has indicated that the prices of gas and 
electricity will continue to increase as the cost of LNG will be about 3 times higher than NG. LNG could be a new 
hope to continue to run such investment but definitely there are concerns about the cost and impact of major policy 
shifts that the energy sector has seen in Bangladesh [32]. 
15. Conclusion 
This study examined the current energy mix, present energy crisis and its way to overcome such scenario by 
utilizing alternative energy sources such as LNG, nuclear energy, biogas, solar, wind and small-scale hydropower 
energy in the context of Bangladesh. A contemporary scenario of Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector has been 
presented. The study shows Bangladesh dependency on gas alone and negligence on other resources. The analysis 
suggests reducing the dependency on natural gas by introducing alternative energy resources and exploring new gas 
fields in ocean areas.

Abstract 
With the rapid industrialization that swarmed across the globe in the past few decades, various environmental issues 
have emerged due to negligence of humans. Hence, in the recent history people across the globe have joined 
together in minimizing the environmental impacts from industrial activities. Special concern has been placed on the 
logistics arena of the supply chain leading to a shift in the traditional objectives of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) 
towards the minimization of environmental impacts from distribution. The new branch of VRP that emerged is 
known as Green Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and consists of three predominantly identified categories as 
Green-VRP, Pollution Routing Problem and VRP in Reverse Logistics. In nowadays, a high concern is placed on the 
management of reverse logistic flows in the supply chain for minimizing the adverse environmental impacts and 
thus requires a proper optimization in the distribution channels associated with this process. This literature review 
extensively analyses the available literature in VRP in Reverse Logistics to identify the current trends, limitations in 
the applicability to real world and the available research gaps. Hence it is hoped that the article will provide 
guidance for future researches.

1. Introduction
Over the years, with the industrialization that engulfed the world people drove towards economic success while 
exploiting the environment thus resulting in many environmental catastrophes that will haunt the world for 
generations. In order to minimize the projected environmental catastrophes and to prevent the environmental 
negligence in economic activities many environmental frontiers and governments around the glove has joint hands 
thus forcing the organizations to implement environmentally sustainable processes. This has led to the rise of 
processes like environmental conscious manufacturing, waste reduction, product recovery and green logistics.  
Green logistics is concerned with the product distribution strategies through which minimum costs are attained while 
ensuring the high quality and minimum negative environmental impacts. Currently the existing distribution schemes 
are defined to be unsustainable in the long term and hence it is required to deduce new strategies to ensure 
environmental sustainability while coping with high customer demands and other external business environmental 
constraints. Also, with the increased pressure placed upon organizations for recycling the remnants of the products, 
supply chains are designed as Closed-Loop in order to ensure that waste materials do not flow out of the 
organizational system.  
Logistic process accounts for a larger portion of the supply chain cost and hence organizations are continuously in 
search of strategies to minimize costs associated in the process. Vehicle routing optimization is one such strategy 
that has been incorporated by organizations to optimize their distribution networks to achieve minimum costs while 
achieving higher customer satisfaction thus ensuring the sustainability in the customer partnership. With time 
optimization of the distribution network has been tied with multiple objectives to suit the complex nature of the real 
world businesses. Within the past few decades with the increased concern in the environmental sustainability new 
branch of vehicle routing optimization emerged namely Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP). Lin et al. (2014) 
in their survey on Green Vehicle Routing Problem has classified GVRPs into three major categories as Green-VRP, 
Pollution Routing Problem (PRP) and VRP in Reverse Logistics (VRPRL).

been carried out in this study area, it still shows a redundancy in the studies that considers the real world practical 
constraints like time windows, periodic delivery, heterogeneous vehicle fleets and catering to stochastic demand 
requirements of customers.  
In nowadays consumers are more driven towards e-businesses instead of brick-and-motor businesses in order to 
satisfy their products requirements and these businesses deal with a large amount of returned goods with zero quality 
defects in daily basis and hence the reverse flow optimization is crucial to these businesses to achieve cost benefits 
and to ensure the availability of products for customer requirements. To the best of the authors’ knowledge reverse 
flow optimizations carried out related to this business area is very limited and hence needs future emphasis placed 
on this area.  
Vehicle routing optimization can be linked with cutting edge technologies and strategies like GPS, Internet of 
Things (IOT) in order to get real-time location details, replenishment levels etc. thus allowing the modeling of 
distribution networks to be more optimized in means of both minimized costs and in eco-concerns. Another trend 
predicted in this study arena is the applicability of vehicle routing optimization in multi-echelon distribution 
systems. Up to now only few researches have been conducted to devise models for achieving the optimality in this 
field and with the significant role played by multi-echelon distribution networks in reverse logistic flows it can be 
predicted that the applicability of vehicle routing optimization to this field will result in increased environmental 
sustainability. 
Over the years researchers around the globe have contributed to the VRPRL literature with models devised to suit 
complex constraints and to achieve multiple objectives of minimized costs and highlighted eco-concerns. However, 
research topic still consists of areas that require the bridging between academic models and real world 
complications. Hence, it is hoped that this review of literature will help in the identification of existing gaps in the 
study area for shaping the future researches.

Abstract 
Pakistan has a wide network of gas pipelines supplying natural gas to domestic, commercial, industrial and power 
production sectors. Due to its capital-intensive nature, many newly developed urban areas, most of suburban localities, 
hilly areas in the north and rural areas across Pakistan are not connected to the gas network. Households and 
commercial activities requiring gas in areas disconnected from natural gas supply, therefore, depend mainly on Liquid 
Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders for different purposes. Of the total requirement in Pakistan, about 40 to 45 percent is 
imported and the remaining requirement is fulfilled through domestic production. About 150 oil and marketing 
companies have the license to import and sell LPG to all sectors across Pakistan. Large consumers of LPG are catered 
directly or through outsourced distributors by these oil marketing companies. Households and commercial users, 
constituting mainly smaller consumers but significantly large in numbers, are served through mostly illegal decanters 
who get their supplies through distributors. Apart from legal issues, this network poses serious problems vis-à-vis 
standard safety procedures in testing, decanting and supply of LPG cylinders. Moreover, there is a host of issues that 
the domestic and small scale commercial users of LPG cylinders face. First, for the lack of reliable LPG volume 
detection in cylinders, sometimes users run out of gas while the cylinder is in use, and the consumers may have to face 
problems in case ‘safety stock’ is not available. Second, special arrangements e.g., of carriage and transport, which 
may not always be convenient, have to be made for bringing cylinders to decanter. Moreover, gas cylinder decanting 
is usually only possible during specific hours and if cylinder decanting is required at some odd time of the day, the 
consumers may have to face availability issues too. This article presents an ingenious solution to the highlighted 
problems, which are essentially related to supply chain integration issues of optimal stock level, demand forecasting, 
order penetration point, and logistics. During an undergraduate capstone project, a smart scale equipped with a 
microcontroller, a load sensor and a GSM module was developed. The device was programmed to send periodic 
messages about LPG level based on weight on load sensor, allowing to estimate LPG level and hence detection of 
demand even before the need arises. Order penetration point was thus shifted upstream for the supplier enabling a 
timely and efficient delivery to all such consumers within a certain geographic zone. If conceived properly, through 
introduction of distributor directly from legal oil and gas marketing companies to the end consumer, the device may 
allow elimination of a complete tier of illegal decanters along with their profit margins, increase the profits of main 
suppliers, possibly reduced cost to consumers, and also help in near accurate demand forecasting.

Abstract 
Uncertainties in the systems are increasing at an unprecedented rate, with the advent of fast paced changes in 
technology. A report which mentions the proliferation of IoT and industrial internet projects estimates that almost 
50% of the manufacturing organizations will adopt Industry 4.0 standards in the upcoming years. Encapsulating the 
uncertain aspects of IoT and cybersecurity has become the prime focus of organizations working with digital networks. 
Organizations transmit sensitive information across networks and cyber security is dedicated to protecting the 
information systems. Dynamic modus operandi of the attackers pose a great challenge in detecting the anomalies. 
There are several layers of security having different levels of vulnerability and independent attributes.  
In this paper, we have modeled the layers of the system as states of a Markov model. We have attempted to predict 
the mean time spent in the transient states. Each state of the model corresponds to vulnerable layers on the network 
which possess individual factors of vulnerability. The model also incorporates the effect of interactions among various 
layers of security. The dependency of layers is modeled as a Markov Graph. The transition probabilities of security 
layers are obtained using Bayesian techniques which provides computational tractability and flexibility for prior 
elicitation. This work will help organizations to design preventive strategies based on the attributes of the attack.

Abstract 
Recent technological advancements have resulted a paradigm shift in the transition from physical world to a virtual 
world in many industrial scenarios. Thus, the development of the concept of industry 4.0 revolutionize the way of 
conducting businesses. The applications of industry 4.0 are rapidly growing in the financial sector as well. As 
modern customer expectations have risen with the technology improvements, they value relationship centric 
experience that hinges on trust and personalization while receiving unlimited accessibility, convenience and speed of 
service. This will challenge banks to deliver their services strategy by enabling advanced technologies. Accordingly, 
there is an essential need to define, formulate a set of guidelines or a basis for evaluating the progress of the current 
state of the operational processes of banking sector in the journey of adapting industry 4.0. This study proposes a 
Maturity Model to assess level of readiness in adapting to industry 4.0 of the banking sector. The proposed maturity 
model consists of five maturity levels namely: Initial, Managed, Defined, Established and Digital Oriented. The 
maturity of the bank was assessed based on seven dimensions and its explanatory factors. This scrutiny will provide 
a comprehensive review of literature in the fields of industry 4.0, its applications in the banking sector and its 
maturity models.

1. Introduction
For the last few decades, the emergence of technology plays a major role in increasing the efficiency of an 
organisation. Since the beginning of the industrialisation, technological dives have created massive changes in the 
way of performing the businesses, hence in retrospect, these deviations can be defined as industrial revolutions. 
Thus they evolve from first industrial revolution (industry 1.0) as steam power, water power and mechanization to 
mass production, assembly line and electricity. Then it evolves as third industrial revolution (industry 3.0), the 
introduction of computerization and automation and the fourth is the move towards digitization (Deloitte, 2015). 
Industry 4.0 is the concept of automation and data exchange in the manufacturing technologies, which enable the use 
of Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), big data analytics, cloud computing and cognitive 
computing in order to move towards a smart world (Hercko and Hnat, 2015). 
The phenomena industry 4.0 was first introduced in 2011 in Germany as a manufacturing perspective to develop the 
country’s economy (Lu, 2017). Thus, it creates a paradigm shift in the global manufacturing sector by revamping 
manufacturing operations and processes in order to capture benefits and create values. The dispersion of the concept 
of industry 4.0 to the service sector was begun recently thus it is being evolved in the financial sector as well. As 
modern customer expectations have risen with the technology improvements, they value relationship centric 
experience that hinges on trust and personalization while receiving unlimited accessibility, convenience and speed of 
service. This will challenge banks to deliver their services strategy in order to survive in the competition. Therefore, 
banking sector has been integrated the concepts of industry 4.0 into their processes to offer better customer 
satisfaction. 
The development of maturity assessment tools is significant to understand the level of potential of the cyber physical 
age, regarding any business who applied industry 4.0 concepts/technologies. Accordingly, it is important to assess 
maturity levels of the banking sector in transition to industry 4.0 concepts / technologies which are essential for 
continuous improvement. Maturity models provide a comprehensive guidance to define, assess and evaluate the

guaranteed. Data security is a major concern. Automated, user friendly, customised 
processes.  
The maturity dimensions are assessed using explanatory factors described in Table 2. Each dimension is assessed 
based on given explanatory factors using a weighted average method with the assumption of each criteria is equally 
important. Considering the first dimension Products and services, is assessed based on: 
C1 :Customised products  
C2 :Digitalised products 
C3 :Data-driven services 
C4 :Digital marketing approaches 
C5 :Service-oriented Architecture 
Evaluation of maturity through the explanatory criteria is performed by using a standardized questionnaire consisted 
of closed-ended questions. Semi-structured interviews are conducted to gather data from senior managers of each 
bank. Every answer is evaluated using a Likert-scale reaching from 1- “not distinct” to 5- “very distinct”. Based on 
the reached value, the maturity dimension is evaluated using a weighted average method. The final maturity level of 
seven dimensions is presented using a radar chart. Example is given in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1: Maturity Level Assessment 
The overall maturity level of the organisation is measured using weighted average of the seven maturity dimensions.  
5. Conclusion and Future Work 
The purpose of this study is to develop and assess a maturity model to understand industry 4.0 maturity level of the 
banking sector. Thus it acts as a guidance tool over the journey of industry 4.0 adaptation. Assessment of the 
maturity of industry 4.0 is important for the banking sector in order to identify current capacity as well as 
opportunities for potential continuous improvements. Thus it is significant to develop a maturity model for the best 
fit. Even though there are several models proposed to measure maturity levels of industry 4.0, their applications to 
the service sector is very limited.  
According to the literature different authors focussed on measuring the industry 4.0 maturity of an organisation 
based on different dimensions. The proposed models are consisted of several maturity levels but most of them are 
not focussing on the characteristics addressed at each level where the organisation needed to follow with the purpose 
of continuous improvement. Hence it is important to consider how an organisation performs under each dimension 
of the maturity assessment model to understand the maturity level of industry 4.0, in order to improve the 
performance to the next maturity level.

Even though organisations who compromise advance technologies to revamp their operations with the purpose of 
benchmarking with world class performance, it is important to be sustainable. Since Industry 4.0 is still at the early 
stages of its development, it is essential to clearly define the structure and methodology of implementation 
guidelines. Therefore, there is a fundamental need to assist organizations which are transforming to the smarter 
operations in order to guide them for improving their capabilities. 
The proposed model of this study is based on the assumption of that all seven maturity dimensions are equally 
important to measure the maturity of industry 4.0 in the banking sector. Hence the relative importance of each 
maturity dimension can be further studied in future, based on the applied industry.

Abstract  
Maintenance management is an important aspect for any organisation. Maintenance management may be 
described as the function of providing policy guidance for maintenance activities, in addition to 
exercising technical and management control of maintenance programs. There are maintenance guidelines 
provided by the manufacturers of different equipment’s. However, for a specific industry with a specific 
location, modifications are required to get the overall comprehensive maintenance framework. In 
Bangladesh, Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinder manufacturing industry has started its journey lately. 
Therefore a case study on maintenance framework considering technological, economic and 
environmental circumstances would be helpful for the industry.

Abstract 
The multi-objective assignment problem is basically the N men –N tasks problem, where a single task has to be 
assigned to an individual with a view of optimizing the outcomes. A common challenge is to address the conflicting 
objectives which produce Pareto–optimal solutions. The main feature of the work is- normalizing all the criteria into 
a single scale regardless of their measurement units and their demand of minimum or maximum, which reliefs us from 
careful attention in quantifying the quality criteria. The methodology also included the decision maker’s preferences 
regarding the objectives. While solving the problem through a genetic algorithm, a new encoding scheme is used 
together with a partially matched crossover (PMX). The working principle of the proposed algorithm is illustrated 
with a numerical example and its effectiveness has been compared with some well-established methodologies. It is 
found that the proposed algorithm provides a better solution with minimal computational effort.

1. Introduction
The assignment problem (AP) is one of the fundamental topics in combinatorial optimization in the branch of operation 
research. It has significant use in production planning, transportation, telecommunication, VLSI design, economics 
etc. (Pramanik and Biswas 2012). It deals with the allocation of the various resources to the various activities so that 
an optimal assignment can be made in the best possible way.  
The linear assignment problem manifests the scenario where assignees are being assigned to perform tasks in one to 
one basis (Sahu and Thapadar 2017). It addresses the question of how to set assignee to tasks in an injective way so 
that the assignment cost (or profit) is minimized (or maximized). In this perspective, an assignment problem is viewed 
as a balanced transportation problem in which all supplies and demands equal ‘1’ for identical numbers of rows and 
columns. Transportation simplex is not applied here because of a high degree of degeneracy (Lin 2009). 
Kuhn (1995) proposed an algorithm for the linear assignment problem known as the Hungarian method. It was 
primarily designed for hand computation (Taha 2006). It has third order run time requirement that is very tedious with 
a large number of the task (Bertsekas 1981). Solving multiple objectives optimization problem is not suitable with 
such an approach. 
In the real arena, management has many objectives for tasks allocation to workers. We often come in close contact 
with an assignment problem, where, cost and time are jointly co-related (Pramanik and Biswas 2012). Multi-objective

Figure 2. Results in different methodologies 
 
The proposed methodology results in 42 units operation cost, 41 units operation time and 14 units quality. Which 
imply the amount of 18% improvement in time and 13% improvement in quality with an expense of 17% cost 
deterioration. Consequently, the result of the proposed methodology is better since the priorities of all the criteria is 
the same. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Improvement by proposed methodology relative to Bao et al. and Tsai et al.   
 
The approach of Bao et al. cannot normalize quality criterion in an interval of [0,1]  when there is no assignment 
having the quality weight of ‘1’. In this case, the reciprocal of quality distributes as normalized quality in an interval 
[0,1) while the other normalized criteria are distributed in an interval of [0,1]. However, all the criteria are distributed 
into a normalized value in an interval of [0,1] in the present work. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In the present paper, a methodology to solve the multi-objective assignment problem has been proposed and solved 
by a genetic algorithm. It is found that the algorithm is very effective to find the global optimal solution quickly. A 
great feature of this work is its simple calculation procedure compared to the other methods. As a whole, the proposed 
methodology doesn’t require careful attention to the determinations of the weight among the resources. Moreover, it 
incorporates the priority of the resources in the decision making process.

Abstract 
The Emergency Medical Services Systems (EMS) plays an important role in healthcare management.  The alarming 
number of emergency cases resulting from natural and man-made disasters is experienced by any country.  In the 
Philippines, some organizations practice the EMS System, however, their average response time of 15 to 30 minutes 
falls below the international standard of 8 minutes.  This paper assesses the current performance of emergency 
ambulance service (EAS) providers in Quezon City.  Significant factors affecting their performance were identified 
using statistical tools. Moreover, proposed alternative solutions were evaluated in order for EAS providers attain the 
international standard of response time using the ArcGIS (Geographic Information System) software.  The results 
showed that the current performance of the public and private EAS providers exceeded their standard response and 
service times and they cannot reach 100% demand coverage using the 8-minute international standard of response. To 
address these inefficiencies, an optimal routing system was proposed by adding new stations so that performance 
measures are achieved. Moreover, policies and procedures were developed to attain a standardized communication 
system, work schedule, and dispatch method for emergency response action. The proposed solutions improved the 
current performance of both public and private EAS providers in Quezon City.

Introduction
Emergencies are considered as time-sensitive cases because they need immediate attention since lives are at stake. 
With reference to a study by Chan in 2015, the AERO (Ambulance Emergency Response Optimization) project in 
Dhaka, it was stated therein that “time-sensitive medical emergencies are a major health concern, comprising over a 
third of all deaths in low- and middle-income.” Some cases considered as time-sensitive medical emergencies include 
1) cardiac arrest, 2) motor countries vehicle accidents, and 3) child and maternal health issues. The immediate response
to emergencies is to bring the victims to the nearest medical facility or hospital, to administer treatment to a patient
on the scene of an emergency, or simultaneous treatment and transport of patient to a medical facility. There are
various vehicles which are exclusively used to immediately respond to on-call emergencies such as ambulances and
other vehicles like fire trucks, police patrol cars, and rescue units, being categorized as Emergency Response Vehicles
(ERV). Nowadays, ambulances have been developed with the capacity to administer immediate treatment right on
site. This is what people call as the EMS (also known as Emergency Medical Services). An emergency medical service, 
as defined by the Department of Health, is a service that provides out-of-hospital acute care and transport to definitive
care, to patients with illnesses and injuries which the patient believes constitute a medical emergency. EMS
ambulances or Emergency Ambulance Service Providers, and other emergency response vehicles are thus very
essential to effectively administer immediate responses (Gaston, C., 2007).  Emergency Ambulance Service Providers
are vital during emergencies: a) from receipt of emergency calls to arrival at the emergency scene (response time),
and b) treatment and transport of patients to hospitals or other medical health facilities (service time) if needed. As
reference to the study entitled, “Response Time Effectiveness: Comparison of Response Time and Survival in an
Urban Emergency Medical Services System”, response time is the interval between the call receipt and arrival on
scene. (Blackwell and Kaufman, 2002). Using this concept, a process flowchart, as shown in Figure 1, is presented
containing the EMS operations.

From the two alternatives presented in the results and the evaluation using the force field analysis, the researchers 
chose the second alternative. It would be costly but the additional stations that would be closer to demand locations 
are ideal for effective response of EAS Providers in Quezon City. All of the significant factors were also considered 
in proposing locations for additional ambulance stations. Table 6 shows the number of stations to be added in Quezon 
City. The ambulance stations would be situated near the hospital indicated in the table. This is because most of the 
patients responded by the EAS Providers were brought to hospitals, therefore with stations being near hospitals mean 
faster emergency response for patients. Every district in Quezon City has its own at least one ambulance station. The 
area of the location is also considered if it is free from any calamities. As much as possible, the flood prone areas were 
only minimized since these are uncontrollable. Table 7 shows the proposed routes for the improvement of the service 
time of the EAS Providers. It begins from the incident location to the nearest hospital from the area. Drive time (min) 
are also indicated. For example, Agham road is 4 minutes away from Philippine Children’s Medical center, and so on. 
The proposed solutions for other factors such as the communication system, dispatching method, and working 
schedules, the researchers generated respective policies and procedures for each. 
 
Figure 4 shows the station coverage map of the selected stations within Quezon City. The colors of the circles on the 
map indicate different kilometer radii. Dark green is for 2-km radius, yellow green is for 3-km radius, yellow is for 4-
km radius, and red is 5-km radius. It can be seen that the 3-km radius, 4-km radius cover the whole part of Quezon 
City.

4   Conclusion 
 
In this study, the current performance of the Public and Private Emergency Ambulance Services (EAS) Providers in 
Quezon City were assessed. By using statistical analysis, factors for response time such as Distance of Location, 
Traffic Condition, Time of Day, Ambulance Speed, Dispatch Time, Day of Week, Equipment Readiness and Weather 
Condition, and factors for service time such as Ambulance Speed, Distance of Location, Traffic Condition, and Time 
of day were found to be significant factors. Using these factors as bases, the researchers proposed two alternatives to 
improve the current performance of the EAS providers. Alternative 1 aims to increase ambulance speed to at least 40 
kph. In this way, the actual 35% demand coverage within an 8-minute response criterion will increase to 66% (or 
higher) demand coverage. A routing analysis was used to help improve the ambulance speed to at least 40 kph. While 
Alternative 2 was proposed to fully cover all the demand areas in Quezon City. In Alternative 2, a minimum of 6 
additional ambulance stations is needed to achieve 100% demand coverage. However, some of the stations are placed 
in the flooded areas, this lead to an optimal solution which is an additional 8 ambulance stations. Also, a routing 
analysis was used to locate the nearest hospitals in a certain demand areas and proposed ambulance station. Also, the

researchers proposed a Standard Policies and Procedures to gain an organized dispatch process, communication 
system, and work schedule. Comparing the two alternatives, Alternative 1 was cost-effective compared to Alternative 
2. Although, Alternative 2 has a higher chance of reaching 100% demand coverage in Quezon City with an 8-minute 
response criterion. Alternative 2 will greatly improve the performance of EAS providers

Abstract 
In the evolving competitive environment, characterized by competition, rapid market change, and globalization, 
companies have to enhance their competitive advantage to survive. In such a context, they have to continuously 
monitor and process information on their competitive environment in order to have an informational advantage over 
their competitors (their capabilities, vulnerabilities, intentions and potential moves). Getting better informational and 
intelligence support is critical and vital. Competitive Intelligence (CI) appears then as a vital component of strategic 
planning and management process. Developing a CI process within a company leads to several benefits such as 
anticipating moves of the other competitors by shedding light on competitor strategies, discovering new competitors 
or potential customers, identifying and analyzing situations, from competitors, customers, suppliers and others factors 
that influence the success or the failure of the company. 
The competitive intelligence concept has attracted growing attention in the last two decades. Existing literature shows 
that CI is a multi-disciplinary concept studied by researchers with different fields of expertise and from different points 
of view either as a concept, a product, a process, a practice/discipline, a method, or a system. Despite this great 
diversity in the body of knowledge related to the CI, CI solutions proposed to the decision-maker are limited. The 
objective of this paper is to propose a practical CI solution for the anticipation of competitor’s decisions in order to 
support the decision-making of a company. Since anticipation evolves under uncertainty, our proposed solution adapts 
the rough set theory, which has the ability to deal with vagueness, uncertainty, and inconsistencies. A modified rough 
set and LEM2 algorithms were used to generate rules that help the decision maker anticipating competitor actions. 
The proposed solution goes further with the aggregation of the generated decision rules using a new proposed 
algorithm that will contribute to enhancing manager’s decision-making process. To motivate the research, the whole 
proposed approach is illustrated considering a case study in the field of telecommunications.

Abstract 
 
The introduction of Industry 4.0 is currently mainly taking place in large companies. In order to introduce the concepts 
and technologies of Industry 4.0 into small and medium-sized enterprises as well, however, there is a need for 
organizational tools, which show which Industry 4.0 concepts are best suited to the respective size of enterprise. At 
present, there is no scientifically founded knowledge on this subject. Therefore, based on a company survey and an 
expert survey, this paper examines and discusses the suitability of industry 4.0 concepts in different company sizes. 
The aim is to find out which Industry 4.0 concepts are considered promising by users (enterprises) and experts. On 
this basis, a final list of suitable Industry 4.0 concepts per company size will be provided.

1. Introduction  
 
The vision of Industry 4.0 pictures a radical transformation of the manufacturing industry, fundamentally characterized 
by new forms of organization enabled by the latest developments in technology. Industry 4.0 embodies the evolution 
of the three former industrial revolutions, whereas this approach is grounded on technological approaches of the smart 
factory, and computer-integrated production. The concept aims at highly flexible, autonomous networking of 
production and components of various kinds through software and data networks. Furthermore, data accrued are 
specifically recorded and evaluated (Hompel et al., 2016). This opens up new potential for autonomous control and 
organization of sustainable production processes or even entire value chains (Dallasega et al., 2015). In addition, this 
creates highly promising opportunities for novel products (Rauch et al., 2015; Rauch et al., 2016a) as well as cloud 
based and disruptive business models (Rauch et al., 2016b).  
As good and promising as this may sound, the whole digital transformation process is not as straightforward and 
represents considerable challenges for companies and especially for small and medium sized enterprises (SME). 
Companies are seeking to exploit the potential of Industry 4.0 in order to make their production more effective and 
efficient and to be more competitive in the global environment (Merz, 2016). In most cases, however, the digital 
revolution causes them considerable problems and challenges and therefore cannot be realized simply as theoretically 
specified in literature. In practice, this shift not only requires large financial resources, which is a major challenge for 
SME in particular, but companies also encounter difficulties from a strategic perspective. As the term Industry 4.0 is 
debated almost everywhere, there is a lot of confusion pervading and consequently companies are struggling to filter 
out ways to benefit from this novel approach. Additionally, many find it challenging to derive strategic fields of action 
for their specific enterprise (Schumacher et al., 2016). As a result, digital change is slowing dramatically (IBM, 2105). 
In response to these problems, some ideas have emerged to propose approaches that support enterprises in overcoming 
the uncertainty surrounding Industry 4.0. So-called Industry 4.0 roadmaps are intended to provide guidance in the 
planning and implementation of modern digital organization models (Ghobakhloo, 2018). According to these, a 
strategic approach should be pursued in order to establish Industry 4.0 successfully in enterprises, bringing together

For small enterprises, experts and companies have similar meanings and propose concepts for preparing the 
organization as well as people for Industry 4.0. In addition, concepts for agile manufacturing and collaboration are 
needed. For medium sized enterprises concepts for realizing a continuous material flow as well as ERP/MES systems 
play an important role. For large enterprises real-time monitoring seems to be a highly requested concept. In all three 
companies sizes the topic cyber security is high ranked and therefore of general interest. 
Both tables give an important statement for practitioners who are currently working on the introduction of Industry 
4.0. On the one hand, Table 4 shows which methods, according to companies, offer the most practical benefits and 
whose feasibility is also perceived as realistic. On the other hand, Table 5 summarizes the opinions of experts and 
scientists, which also include concepts whose importance the companies are not yet aware of or which they simply do 
not (sufficiently) know, since they, for example, will only be transferred from research to industry in the near future. 
Therefore, practitioners should consider both tables for the definition of initiatives and the selection of Industry 4.0 
concepts to be introduced in the company. 
 
6. Conclusion and outlook 
 
The introduction of Industry 4.0 in industrial companies poses a particular challenge for small and medium-sized 
enterprises. While large enterprises can afford their own personnel resources for the introduction and research of 
Industry 4.0 topics, this is usually not the case with SMEs. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify the most 
promising Industry 4.0 concepts for different sizes of enterprises (small, medium, large) on the basis of an existing 
Industry 4.0 self-assessment tool as well as a survey conducted among enterprises and experts. The study showed that 
the potential of Industry 4.0 concepts is assumed to be much higher by medium-sized and large enterprises than by 
small enterprises. Experts in particular see a great opportunity in the introduction and transfer of Industry 4.0 in 
medium-sized enterprises. While large enterprises show a uniform and homogeneous picture of meanings between 
enterprises and experts, this is not the case for small and medium-sized enterprises. This shows that there are still 
major discrepancies between research and industrial practice and that there is therefore a need for further research and 
knowledge transfer to bring Industry 4.0 into this kind of companies.  
Further research is therefore needed for the future to investigate why Industry 4.0 concepts have not yet been adopted 
in some cases. Especially for small enterprises a more detailed investigation should be carried out in the future to 
understand why Industry 4.0 is considered to have a lower potential.

ABSTRACT 
The purpose of this paper is to attempt to provide an overview of the exceedingly differentiated, itemized and multi-
disciplinary research in the field of Intelligent Transportations Systems and more specifically the «Advanced Public 
Transportation Systems APTS». 
Towards this purpose, we present the progress and results of a systematic literature review on the topic of APTS. The review 
is positioned in, and utilizes the literature of, the field of Intelligent Transportations Systems. In the review, we study the 
following research question: What researches and solutions have been developed so far in the field of Advanced Public 
Transportation Systems? 
 
The main result of this study is that, we established history time sheet with a global perspective of APTS represented by 
five main phases, then classified the research and solutions by activity and usage type (Paratransit or Mass transit), followed 
by a review of current APTS characteristics based on the Right of Way (ROW) and by service type.

Literature Review (SLR); Right of Way (ROW). 
1. Introduction
Currently cities are considered as the engine of the worldwide economy and to date they are home to more than half of 
Earth’s Population (According to the United Nations). Thusly, urban transport is a key factor in the economic, social and 
urban development of the city. It is one of the important variables on which all urban planning is based in order to ensure 
availability, safety, Comfortability and affordability. 
In recent decades, the need of mobility within urban area has grown rapidly, leading to a multitude of problems, including 
severe traffic jams and pollution. This need is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the future, which will further 
complicate the situation. The traditional approach to face the issues is to extend the infrastructure. However, researchers as 
well as professionals are interested more on ITS as a solution to face the current and future issues. Since that, their shown 
and potential benefits have made them more attractive.

5. Discussion 
In this section, we first discuss our general observations by a discussion regarding our research question. Then, we present 
a research agenda for future works. 
 
5.1. General observations 
 
The primary studies identified were almost exclusively research documents. Therefore, we extracted information on the 
APTS evolution, classification and characteristics. Researchers' bias may have influenced the choice of primary studies and 
data extraction. The selection of primary studies may have been distorted by misinterpretation of the inclusion criteria. This 
risk was mitigated by the coordination of the two researchers in designing the inclusion criteria.  When inclusion criteria 
were used later, abstract filtering was done by both researchers independently, and confusing cases were resolved through 
case-by-case discussions. In the full text filtering stage, the first researcher performed the initial screening by making the 
decision regarding unambiguous cases. For the less clear cases both researchers read the paper and made independent 
proposals for inclusion or exclusion decisions. In cases where they agreed, the paper was included or excluded on the basis 
of their joint agreement. Articles that were not yet clear were discussed and resolved by the two researchers together. 
 
5.2. Future research agenda 
 
In this paper we had a worldwide thought about the recent advances in the field of Advanced Public Transportation 
Systems. We have observed that there is a massive increase of the number of researches in this subject considering that that 
it interests each citizen and organizations to search for good feasible solution for transportation in urban area, and thus for 
both, developed and growing countries; Based on that, we will continue our SLR through opting for an empirical study 
regarding the relevant challenges and success factors that face APTS implementation in cities. We think it requires significant 
further study and can be considered as essential and important point to this research. 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
In this paper and through a systematic literature review we analyzed papers describing and presenting qualitative findings 
of APTS research advances. By extracting and classifying public transport research and solutions developed so far in different 
countries.   
The main conclusion of this study is that, we established history time sheet with a global perspective of APTS represented 
by five main phases, then classified the research and solutions by activity and usage type (Paratransit or Mass transit), followed 
by a review of current APTS characteristics based on the Right of Way (ROW) and by service type. 
As future research topics, we are working on case studies and surveys on APTS applications challenges, studies on APTS 
deployment practices & success factors in developing countries.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this paper is to identify the health system stakeholders in Morocco. The methodology is based on 
two steps. First, a literature review was performed to establish a preliminary list of the main categories of health 
systems stakeholders. Second, the said list was projected onto the Moroccan context, seeking correspondence between 
each category of stakeholders and their Moroccan counterparts. Then we proceeded to detail each category by listing 
the actors it includes through the analysis of national reports by the ministry of health and others. Results allow 
visualizing a wide range of actors with different roles and objectives. 
 
Key words 
Stakeholders, health system, mapping, Morocco.  
 
1. Introduction  
 
Health facilities are required, nowadays more than before, to improve their services’ quality (Frichi, Jawab, et 
Boutahari 2018b). In this context, the concept of Total Quality Management is adopted as quality improvement 
approach with a client-supplier orientation (Mendes et Dias 2018), which places the satisfaction of internal and 
external actors as an objective to be measured and constantly improved (Frichi, Jawab, et Boutahari 2018a). However, 
health systems are characterized by the multiplicity and diversity of stakeholders (or actors) at different levels. 
Achieving the satisfaction of all these stakeholders is a quiet difficult task (Ezzerouali 2008). Thus, it is necessary to 
rank stakeholders in order to prioritize those who are the most concerned by quality improvement issues. However, 
before ranking them a question of great practical relevance arises: Who are the stakeholders in the health system?  
 
The ambition of this paper is to contribute to providing answers to this question by limiting the paper’s scope on 
the case of the Moroccan health system. The theoretical framework adopted is the stakeholder theory, which is the 
basis of the strategic management of organizations. The paper is organized in three parts. In the first one, we briefly 
review the foundations and objectives of the stakeholder theory. In the second part, we establish a preliminary list of 
the main categories of health systems stakeholders based on international researches. The third part is devoted to 
identifying heath system stakeholders in Morocco. 
  
2. Stakeholder theory 
  
2.1. Definition  
 
Stakeholder theory provides an analysis of the company's relationships with its environment (Gond et Mercier 
2004). It is an attempt to redesign the firm's theory, to further integrate the actors of its environment and to abolish the 
shareholder vision of profit maximization (Mullenbach-Servayre 2007). This theory, although already introduced in 
the 1960s,  it has been significantly developed starting 1984, following Freeman's publication of the book, Strategic 
Management : A Stakeholder Approach (Mullenbach-Servayre 2007).  
 
Stakeholder theory is based on the concept of stakeholder; its definition doesn’t make any unanimity. In fact, there 
is no consensus among authors on a single, accepted and recognized definition (Gond et Mercier 2004). In this paper, 
we cite the most commonly used and widespread stakeholder’s definition: any group or individual who can affect or 
is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives (Freeman 1984). Stakeholders are therefore individuals,

Abstract 
In today’s competitive environment Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are facing many challenges and growing 
pressure from various stakeholders. To cope with this pressure, HEIs require a supportive managerial approach 
that fosters the understanding of stakeholders’ needs and expectations.   
Total Quality Management (TQM) is considered as one of the most comprehensive approaches to enhance 
performance and to meet customer needs.  While this approach is being successfully adopted in the manufacturing 
sector, the same cannot be achieved in many service organisations. HEIs operate in a unique environment with 
multiple stakeholders and subjective nature of managing TQM compared with the manufacturing industry and 
encounter more challenges due to their unique nature. Most of the existing studies focus on students and give less 
attention to staff. There is lack of research that that focus on staff views, thus more attention should be given to 
them due to their vital role as a mediator between the policymakers and students as well as their closeness to the 
encountered problems. Some of these problems might result from the nature of HEIs environment, and some 
might originate from existing perceptions regarding TQM applicability in HEIs.   
This research aims to contribute toward the identification of TQM challenges in HEIs from the staff perspective 
in order to gain a better understanding of TQM challenges. The study designed to collect qualitative data by 
conducting semi-structured interviews with staff from HEIs. The findings are expected to be an important step 
towards the identification of major TQM challenges in HEIs and to create better awareness regarding the potential 
obstacles as well as to call future research to move towards the second step of seeking and proposing a TQM-
framework that facilitate successful TQM implementation.

Abstract 
Instruction in higher education institutions continues to proceed along the traditional path. Exposure to real-life 
experiences relevant to the discipline of study could greatly enhance students’ understanding of how their study 
relates to the real world. This is particularly important for engineering students where the focus is on finding 
practical solutions to real-life problems. Offering such experiences, however, is restricted by many limiting 
factors. Recent technological advancements in the fields of simulation and virtual/augmented reality present a 
viable solution to offer semi-real experiences that avoid many of the limiting factors. An important 
consideration for this approach is that students won’t have to physically leave campus to gain the intended 
experience.   
In this presentation, authors present the applications of the virtual reality as a teaching medium for providing 
students with realistic experiences in relation to manufacturing processes. This presentation is also intended to 
demonstrate how: 
•
Complex systems utilizing simulation tools that support virtual reality and allow the students to walk
through and interact with the virtual surroundings could be developed.
•
Students could utilize the virtual environment to further improve real systems.
•
Students could create and experiment with their own models and to optimize their proposed systems
output by 3D virtual systems.

Abstract 
Centrifugal slurry pumps are used in many applications such as in the mining, chemical and in the industrial plants. 
Ergo City Deep Plant uses centrifugal slurry pumps to pump slurry from its pumping station to Elsburg pumping 
station over a distance of about 50 km. Due to unplanned breakdowns, the pumps are not operating at peak efficiency 
point, and as a result the plant does not meet its monthly production target. Ergo City Deep Plant used reactive 
(breakdown) maintenance, which had escalated the maintenance operating costs year on year. In this study, predictive 
maintenance through condition monitoring techniques was used to improve the availability of centrifugal slurry pump. 
This research proved that predictive maintenance is a better maintenance method for centrifugal slurry pumps than 
reactive maintenance, because the pumps availability increased by 49 %, the downtime and maintenance costs have 
also been reduced simultaneously by 58%. Furthermore, also production losses have been reduced, and therefore 
boosted the profit margin of the organization.

1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been an increasing concentration in maintenance within the business sector. This is a result 
of escalating pressure upon mining operations to meet customer and corporate demands, as well as improving 
equipment availability and performance (Baglee and Knowles 2010). Therefore, maintenance with its various 
activities, resources, measurement and management, has become critical to mining operations (Simoes et. al 2011). In 
this respect, maintenance have to play an important role in helping organizations to reach their goals of productivity, 
profitability and competiveness and making sure that their equipment operates effectively and efficiently (Baglee and 
Knowles 2010). 
Maintenance, as describe by (Gustavsson et al. 2014), is the function of retaining an item or, restoring it to its original 
state or, acceptable standard for use ‘or to meet its functional standard’. Maintenance is generally accepted as a time 
consuming and costly activity that may render equipment unavailable if not effectively practiced (Narayan 2012).  (de- 
Smidt-Destombes et al. 2004) stated that, proper plant maintenance could significantly reduce overall operating costs, 
and boost plant productivity and organization’s profit.  
Maintenance strategy is a long- term plan, covering all aspects of maintenance management, which sets the direction 
for maintenance management, and contains firm action plans for achieving a desired future state for the maintenance 
function (Dunn 2009). It is therefore, important for an organization to adopt to the ‘correct’ maintenance strategy to

Abstract 
Plastic packaging material plays a vital role in people’s daily lives, and it is a fact that most of which are petroleum-
based like the one being used in the Philippines. This type of plastic is very strong, less brittle, but non-biodegradable 
that would take hundreds of years before it decays, which in turn decreases the available capacity of sanitary landfills. 
If this scenario continued, many of the sanitary landfills in the Philippines will be forced to close as what the others 
have already been into. Due to this concern, this research would introduce the use of a sustainable biodegradable 
packaging material which can be a substitute to the petroleum-based plastics. This research will identify various 
alternatives and choose among these alternatives through the application of multi-criteria decision making with 
consideration of valuable criteria in selecting a packaging material. The chosen alternative will then be subjected for 
demand and supply analysis to check the readiness of the Philippines for the use of the chosen sustainable 
biodegradable packaging material, and check its eventual impact to the capacity of sanitary landfills.

Abstract 
In the design of complex systems, the accurate measure and prediction of human operator workload can be critical.  
If a genuine human-system interface is what is desired, the system components must have the capability to “detect” 
system state and adapt accordingly.  EEG is perhaps the most accurate means available to directly measure changes 
in neural activity. Until now, use of EEG has required carefully controlled conditions, extensive set-up time and in-
depth knowledge for operation and interpretation. New non-conductive-gel electrodes have been created by several 
groups. These systems are “pull-on”, like a bathing cap. Recording systems and analytic techniques have also 
become more advanced.  Further, human eye tracking technology has experienced significant improvement in recent 
years in such critical areas as sampling.  To date, many eye activity behaviors are correlated with visual and 
cognitive demands of various tasks.  What is lacking in the current body of literature are real time models of human 
operator state that can be integrated into the system functioning.  With input concerning operator state available to 
an adaptive system, the task itself could be modified to account for operator fatigue, attentional state, and other 
performance characteristics of interest.

Abstract 
Entrepreneurs in developing countries encounter several problems that might undermine their ability to become 
effective entrepreneurs and contribute to the national economy. These problems could exacerbate in micro-businesses 
and more specifically in women entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, women entrepreneurship is one of many sectors which 
potentially boost nation’s income of the country. However, there is a paucity of studies about women entrepreneurship 
in general and Indonesia, a developing country, in particular. Therefore, barriers analysis is needed to examine the 
problem so that it can be used as a reference in creating an enabling environment. This paper examines barriers which 
faced by Indonesian women entrepreneur especially for Greater Jakarta area and having Micro and Small business 
scale using four indicators: individual-familial, socio-cultural, economic-financial-commercial and structural that we 
adopted from Niazkar & Arab-Moghaddam (2011) framework. An online questionnaire was spread out and data 
collected from 50 women entrepreneur respondents. Based on the survey, there were distinctive barriers among women 
entrepreneur in Indonesia. Orderly from the most important barriers as follows: economic-financial-commercial, 
structural, socio-cultural, and personal-familial.

1. Introduction
Barriers in term of economic, sociocultural, physical or emotional commonly faced by entrepreneurs especially in 
developing countries. These barriers might slow them down and undermine their ability to be a better entrepreneur 
and minimize their contribution to the national economy (Miller & Le Breton-Miller, 2017, Al-Awlaqi et al., 2018). 
Moreover, these barriers could exacerbate in micro-businesses, and more specifically in women entrepreneurship for 
some reasons such as undeveloped capabilities in business areas, underdeveloped owner-manager capabilities, and the

5. Conclusion 
 
In this study we examined the barriers of women entrepreneurship in Indonesia in Greater Jakarta. Based on the result, 
the first variable about individual-familial has one question about various obligation in life (job-family) was not valid. 
It might have been because 74% respondents were single and 46% of the respondents did not have the number of a 
dependents. The rest of the variables are valid and reliable. From the results, it can be concluded that the most 
significant barriers to women entrepreneurship are in the following order: economic-financial-commercial, structural, 
socio-cultural, and individual-familial. Individual-familial had the highest percentage barrier which came from lack 
of information about supportive resources. Socio-cultural was the biggest barrier in responsibility and sensitivity 
necessary to entrepreneurship. In addition, economic-financial-commercial had the higesht percentage barrier in 
cooperation in allocating expenses, and the last variable of structural had the most barrier in identification of new 
markets. We hope that this research could benefit stakeholders as a reference for the enacting policies and regulations 
to encourage women entrepreneurship in Indonesia. Moreover, further research is expected to be conducted to examine 
the relationship between variables, and expand the sampling into other regions throughout Indonesia.

Abstract 
Indonesia Telecommunication market is the early stage of digital era. Digital transformation is required by incumbent 
firms through developing dynamic capability that focus on Customer value and Operation model. Customer value 
reflects to market orientation, while operation model is related to the capabilities of firms in formulating innovation. 
In disruptive era, the development of dynamic capabilities is driven by digital leadership. The study on the role of 
digital leadership in relation between dynamic capability and digital leadership, market orientation and innovation 
capabilities has not been explored, hence this study has aims to assess the effective path in developing dynamic 
capability, whether it will be direct or indirect through market orientation or innovation capability driven by digital 
leadership. The study was conducted with questionnaire survey of 88 senior leader respondents, with statistical data 
analysis used Smart-PLS application. The result explained that digital leadership has influence significant impacts 
both  directly and indirectly through market orientation on  developing dynamic capability.  While the mediating role 
of innovation capability has not shown significant on relationship between dynamic capability and digital leadership.  
Keywords 
Digital leadership, market orientation, innovation capability, dynamic capability 
1. Introduction
Indonesia in the early stage of digital Era (Das, Gryseels, Sudhir, & Tan, 2016). The competition is very tight
in additional with these, global players, such as Google, Apple, What’s Up, and other Over The top (OTT) players 
provides substitution product and services that threat existing incumbent product and services. Thus, it will impact to 
incumbent firms to sustain the existing business that rely on legacy business which is voice and SMS. Legacy business 
has disrupted by OTT players through attractive business model that simple and cheaper.  In other hand, Indonesia 
has phenomenal growth in innovation, but it has lack in digital infrastructure development (IMD, 2017). Indonesia 
requires significant amount of digital infrastructure investment developed by existing incumbent firms, while the 
return become a question mark due to competition and digital disruption from emerging entries.  The phenomenon of 
digital disruptive has been studied in Harvard business, the incumbent fail to maintain the sustainable business due to 
the agility to adapt the change (Christensen, 1997). In Digital era, The transformation is required to make over existing 
capabilities to enhance it become dynamic capabilities by renewing business model innovation (Chesbrough, 2010; 
Teece, 2017; Zott & Amit, 2017). Dynamic capability is defined as a holistic approach of the firm ability to integrate, 
build and reconfigure their resources and competence to address the changing of market environments (Teece, Pisano, 
1218","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

1.524 and p-value = 0.1289>0.05. This means that H0 is accepted while H2 is rejected. There is also no significant 
impact of innovation capability in mediating role on relationship between dynamic capability and digital leadership. 
 
4. Discussion  
The results are aligned with the study on disruption technology and innovation conducted by previous study  
(Christensen, 1997; Lopez-Cabrales et al., 2017; Markides, 2006)(1997), where the incumbent firm should adapt the changing 
of customer and market to sustain and driving digital transformation.  digital leadership has a direct and indirect to dynamic 
capability mediated by market orientation.  Global vision and collaboration bring significant value to digital leadership followed 
by inquisitive, deep knowledge and thinker. This finding supports Rudito (2017) and Wasono and Furinto (2018), who found 
that digital leadership supporting innovation capability in disruptive era. This finding brings the implication for incumbent firms 
to use digital leadership to establish dynamic capability through direct and indirect mediated by market orientation. While, the 
mediating role of innovation capability is not impact on relationship between dynamic capability and digital leadership. 
Market orientation is formulated by dominant responsiveness followed by intelligent generation and intelligent 
dissemination capability. These findings indicate that in term of market orientation, the culture and behavior of the management 
and firms that adaptive to the change and responsive to the market create the value to customer and firms themselves. This 
finding aligns with the study before done by, Protcko and Utz Dornberger (2014) and Narver and Slater (1990).  
The dynamic capability is dominant influenced by strategic capability, followed by management capability, adaptive 
capability and innovation capability. It means that the long-term view of management and firm in anticipating the market 
dynamic is important for incumbent firms. This is indicating that the long-term view through transformation is taken priority 
for incumbent firm in facing disruptive era.  
The Innovation capability as mediating role was not supporting in relationship of dynamic capability and digital 
leadership. This finding shown the important in development of internal capability, it will optimal by integrating and focus on 
market and customer. Based on resources-based view that provide the distinctive organization capability is important through 
providing internal resources that valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and on-substitutable capabilities (Barney, 1991). 
Incumbent firms are required to develop the core competence to compete with new entrance in disruptive era. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of hypotheses testing, it can be concluded that digital leadership has direct and indirect impact 
to dynamic capability, where the market orientation has a mediating role, while, the innovation capability was not a 
mediating role in the relationship of dynamic capability and digital leadership.  
Further study can be explored using a more extended sampling, industry and with consideration of markets outside of 
Indonesia. A longitudinal research design should also be done to assess direct and indirect impact of digital leadership 
into dynamic capability to provide value to the firms.

Abstract 
Vehicle-Fleet´s Managers require to identify relevant aggregate metrics to monitor the performance of their 
vehicles and drivers. The chosen metric should help in the decision making process of programs relative to 
the vehicle maintenance, drivers awarding, vehicle routing, fleet renovation, among others. It is well known 
that fuel consumption is around half of the operative cost of vehicular fleets. However, fuel consumption 
depends of several factors, such as, vehicle weight, load, route, vehicle technology, road conditions, driving 
patterns, traffic, among others. Therefore fuel consumption by itself is not an appropriate metric for these 
purposes. The situation worsen for the case of freight transportation where companies usually have a large 
diversity of vehicles capacities and technologies and cover many different routes.   
We hypothesized that fuel consumption, measured as l/km-gross ton, is the metric to follow. To test this 
hypothesis, a monitoring campaign was developed on a non-homogenous fleet of 50 heavy-duty freight 
vehicles, with nationwide operation, in a country with large variations in altitude (0-3500 masl), during two 
months of normal operation.  Fuel consumption behavior was analyzed with several options of performance 
metrics. Results indicated that for cases when vehicles are almost always fully loaded, specific consumption 
measured in [l/km – curb ton] also works for these purposes.

Table 4 shows the determination coefficient  𝑅𝑅2 of simple regression models for the four metrics with each variable. 
 𝑅𝑅2 indicates the proportion of the variation of the metric that is explained by the variable. Again, FE4 is not explained 
by any of the variables. Table 4 also shows the p_values of the Anderson-Darling normality tests. Low values for p 
means that the residuals are not normally distributed and therefore, the regression models for the three first metrics 
are not adequate to explain the metrics.

Conclusions 
Unlike the original hypothesis, that FE3 would be the most independent metric to be followed, results showed that no 
significant differences were observed between FE2 and FE3. More importantly, results showed that FE4 is the metric 
that though not identically, is the most similarly normally distributed. In addition, the fact that the 𝑅𝑅𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
2
 of FE4 of the 
ANOVA for all the logistics variables studied are so low (below 10%) can be interpreted as this metric is the most 
""dimensionless"" or more ""independent"" of the operational factors that are controllable at a logistic planning level. This 
suggests that it is a good option to take it as an input parameter in logistic models such as vehicle routing, resource 
allocation, among others. For the studied case, the fuel consumption parameter is 4.07 l/100km-et with a standard 
deviation of 0.65. This value should be multiplied by the curb weight of the selected vehicle and the distance to be 
assigned to travel in a given route to estimate fuel consumption and then its cost. 
The most dimensionless fuel consumption metric that is distributed normally and that applies to the entire data set is 
FE4 (l /100km-empty vehicle weight (tons)).

It worth highlight that a single variable help to explain 85% of FE1 variation, which is the empty weight of the vehicle. 
With very close 𝑅𝑅𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
2
 the total weight also explains FE1. This similarity is consistent with the high correlation between 
both variables and probably because practically all recorded trips carried a load close to their capacity. However, if 
the load were more variable, the total weight would be expected to better explain the FE1. This claim could not be 
validated with the available data.

Abstract 
Disability has always been a problem in developing countries like the Philippines. It is even aggravated by the 
environment and the lack of tools or equipment that can assist the handicapped people. Although there are equipment 
or assistive tools that designed specifically for use by these individuals, they contribute only a very small percentage 
of the total number of products that the handicapped people need. Survey was conducted to explore the current issues 
facing wheelchair users and to address the problems they experience in wheelchair usage. Results showed that users 
experience difficulty in propelling, steering, and transferring to and from the wheelchairs that result to discomfort and 
musculoskeletal disorders of the users. Thus, this research paper is focused on developing an ergonomic design of 
hand-cycle attachment that assists heavy-loaded wheelchair users especially when wheeling through long distances, 
challenging terrains and slopes. Features of the proposed design consist of synchronous propulsion system, foldability, 
mobility, adjustability, easy installation and stability by adding a stand that would keep the hand-cycle attachment in 
its upright position even when it is not in use. Clamping system and lever are also added to apply tensile and 
compressive forces to the wheelchair and can be rotated to maintain an ideal seat inclination of users in using 
wheelchairs. In addition to these, the design also includes a free-wheeling mechanism so the users will not have to 
apply force to the pedals all the time to keep the device running. The usability and effectiveness of the proposed hand-
cycle attachment device was tested and validated using Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) tool. It was found 
that the use of the proposed device significantly decreased the risk of users for musculoskeletal disorders and provide 
ease and comfort for users compared to wheelchair use alone. Through the application of the principle of mechanics, 
propulsive force with the attachment device was computed to be significantly lower than the current tangential force 
applied by wheelchair users on the hand rims during propulsion. Respondents who tested the prototype also reported 
significantly lower propulsion difficulty scores.

1. Introduction
Disability has always been a problem in developing countries like the Philippines. The United Nations Development 
Program estimates that 80 percent of persons with disabilities live in developing countries. The Philippine Statistics 
Authority revealed that of the 92.1 million household population in the country, 1,443,000 persons or 1.57 percent 
have disabilities, with the second most prevalent of these mobility impairment (PSA, 2010). Not only is a great 
percentage (50%) of disabled people economically-challenged as shown by a survey conducted by the Philippine 
Institute for Development Studies (PIDS), but they are also deprived of doing many things that normal people enjoy. 
Disability, apart from being defined by a missing limb or an impairment of any of the five senses, is even aggravated 
by the environment and the lack of tools or equipment that can assist these handicapped people. 
Although there are special products or assistive technologies that are designed specifically for use by these individuals, 
they constitute only a very small percentage of the total number of products that the physically challenged need to be 
able to use. Moreover, everyone, including the mobility impaired, need to be able to have access to a wide range of 
opportunities found outside, in the real world (AIES, 1994). On account of these facts, this study is geared towards 
the empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), particularly the mobility impaired, in such a way that the 
solutions presented in this study will pave the way for PWDs to take control of their own mobility and live their lives

(1996) concerning push rim forces and joint kinetics during wheelchair propulsion. Not only is this force easier to 
exert, but it also enables travelling longer distances for only a shorter period of time compared to a wheelchair’s usual 
speed. 
 
Compared with the previous wheelchair propulsion posture, the new posture eliminated the raising of the shoulders 
and the abduction of the upper arms. The lower arm is now situated at a lower angle in reference to the upper arm, 
and there is no need to move it out to the side of the body. Additionally, the wrist is also not bent from the midline. 
From a previous score of 6, the new RULA score of 3 now indicates a lower MSD risk level. This shows that the 
product indeed provides a more comfortable means of transportation for wheelchair users.  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
A vast majority of wheelchair users are faced daily with many struggles, attributable mostly to inaccessibility and the 
lack of the mobility required to participate fully in a normal Filipino life. Postures taken on by wheelchair users during 
propulsion pose a risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders as revealed by RULA. Additionally, wheelchair users 
perceive propulsion to be very difficult, resulting to pains in the back, arms, and hands. In response to these problems, 
this study revolved around creating a design of an ergonomic, detachable, foldable, and cost-effective hand-cycle 
attachment. 
 
 
The prototype key specifications include a folded dimension of 2.17 x 1.17 x 3.67 cubic feet, a 15-second installation 
time, a gain ratio between the wheel and the hand cranks of about 3.48, a weight of 17.6 pounds, an adjustable hand-
crank height and distance, and a material cost of PhP 4,527.44. Features differentiating the proposed design in this 
study from the existing mobility aids are the synchronous propulsion system, foldability, capability of being stowed 
inside vehicles, adjustability, easy installation, and stability by adding a stand that would keep the hand-cycle 
attachment in its upright position. A clamping system and a lever apply both tensile and compressive forces to the 
wheelchair, rotating it slightly by 10°, which was known to be the ideal seat inclination. These two product 
characteristics also facilitate the lifting of the caster wheels and the stand off the ground to prevent these from hitting 
slight bumps in the road during travel. Aside from these, the prototype also features a free-wheeling mechanism, so 
the user will not have to apply force to the pedals all of the time to keep the device running. 
 
Quality Function Deployment gave way to the formulation of the initial design specifications that were given priority 
in the design. This tool also enabled the translation of the wheelchair users’ needs and requirements into their technical 
equivalents. Through Value Engineering, it was decided upon which among the alternatives should be adopted for the 
propulsion system, folding system, attachment method, and the type of material that would yield the highest values as 
perceived by the customers. Working in conjunction with Anthropometric Analysis, the Theory of Inventive Problem 
Solving was used to address trade-offs identified in the roof of the House of Quality, thus resulting to the formulation 
of the design’s adjustment mechanism. Design Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (DFMEA) was carried out to pro-
actively prevent or mitigate the risks involved with the use of the product through some design modifications, 
maintenance procedures, and safety measures. The outcome was a working prototype that integrates all the technical 
requirements. 
 
Issues experienced during the course of the prototype fabrication were the wheel diameter, corrosion rate of the 
material, and the hand crank distance range. The latter two, however, were resolved by coating the metal frame with 
paint and by placing a cushion at the backrest to retain the leaning position of the user during propulsion, respectively. 
The wheel diameter, although exceeding the specification, did not cause the weight of the entire attachment to go 
beyond the upper limit and in fact, also improved the mechanical advantage of the hand-cycle by increasing the 
distance travelled for every rotation of the hand crank. Still, most of the initial design specifications were adequately 
met. 
 
Apart from the biomechanical analysis of the hand-cycle which showed that the required propulsive force indeed 
decreased, the prototype testing further built up on this finding by showing that users now perceive propulsion as an 
easy activity, compared to how they previously rated wheelchair propulsion as very difficult. The hand-cycle 
attachment was deployable in less than a minute, and users found it easy to install the device without needing assistance 
from other people. However, they experienced slight difficulties in steering the hand-cycle due to the weight being 
supported by the hand-cycle, and they also find it hard to squeeze the hand brake. RULA score decreased from 6 to 3,

indicating that the risk of musculoskeletal disorders is much lower with the use of the hand-cycle attachment than the 
wheelchair alone.  
 
Overall, responses from the wheelchair users who were the subjects of the study evidenced that the designed 
attachment device is an excellent solution to mobility problems of handicapped persons in the Philippines. Despite 
this, the design can still be subjected to more improvements and future work will enable this device to better address 
the needs of the PWDs.

Abstract 
A well-managed warehouse system with effective facility layout design is the key concept of modern supply chain 
system and has an important role in the success of a company (Baker and Canessa, 2009). According to Glock & 
Grosse (2012) several components must be considered when developing an efficient warehouse facility layout and 
design, one of which is the material placement and location, and one of the critical activities in material placement is 
order picking. Picking process have become an important part of the supply chain process and is seen as the most 
labor-intensive and costly activity for almost every warehouse, where the cost is estimated to be 55% of the total 
warehouse operating expense. That is why, the researchers aim to design facility layout focusing on material placement 
and location for warehouse system. The study covers two largest sugar milling warehouses in the Philippines that 
experience delay in material placement due to slow response time and long cycle time in its picking process. 
Techniques such as time study, ABC inventory analysis, quality function deployment (QFD) tool, systematic layout 
planning (SLP) and systems simulation were used in order to design and improve the current material placement layout 
of the companies. It is concluded that using ABC inventory analysis based on the order picking frequency of materials 
and implementation of “U” flow material warehouse layout design significantly reduces time and distance spent in 
searching and picking activities and improves the overall warehouse operation of the companies.

1. Introduction
Warehouse layout directly affects the day-to-day efficiency of any business operation, from manufacturing and 
assembly to order fulfillment and more. It is important that a warehouse has enough space to operate efficiently. 
However, it may be even more important that the space is laid out in a way that optimizes the warehouse’s abilities.  
A well-managed warehouse system with effective facility layout design is the key concept of modern supply chain 
system and has an important role in the success of a company (Baker and Canessa, 2009). As levels of supply chain 
integration have increased and inventory levels have been reduced, reliable, on-time deliveries have become 
increasingly critical for success of the company.  
According to Glock & Grosse (2012) several components must be considered in developing a warehouse facility 
layout design, and one of which is material placement and location. And one the most critical activities in material 
placement and location is order picking activity. Order picking can be defined as the activity by which a small number 
of goods are extracted from a warehousing system, to satisfy a number of independent customer orders. Order picking 
processes have become an important part of the supply chain process. It is seen as the most labor-intensive and costly 
activity for almost every warehouse, where the cost of order picking is estimated to be as much as 55% of the total 
warehouse operating expense. As the order picking process involves significant cost and can affect customer 
satisfaction levels, there have been increasing numbers of process improvements proposed to help companies with 
this supply chain issue (Murray, 2018).

Similarly, the result of the order picking cycle time and average distance travel for both design alternatives for CAPDI 
is presented in the tables below. Based on simulation, the “U” flow material warehouse design significantly reduces 
the cycle time of order picking by 36% as oppose to “Through” flow material warehouse design. In terms of distance 
travelled, the “U” flow design also resulted in shorter distance by 7% compared to “Through” flow design. Therefore, 
it is proposed for BSCI to use the “U” flow layout design for material placement and location. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Material placement and warehouse facility layout design is the main core of this research study. The material 
warehouses of Batangas Sugar Central Incorporated (BSCI) and Central Azucarera de Don Pedro Incorporated 
(CADPI) have been considered in this research since the two largest sugar milling companies in the country experience 
delay due to slow response time and long cycle time in order picking activity. Techniques such as motion and time 
study, ABC inventory analysis, quality function deployment (QFD), systematic layout planning and system simulation 
were developed and used to design and improve the facility layout for material placement and location.  
 
The researchers applied the ABC classification based on the picking frequency of the materials in the warehouse. 
Class A materials that have the highest picking frequency are therefore located in areas with the easiest, best access, 
and are stored closest to the input and output doors of the proposed layout. Class B materials that have a medium 
picking frequency are located in areas less desirable compared to class A material. And for class C materials that have 
the lowest picking frequency are located in the least desirable location in the material warehouse. The researchers 
concluded that using ABC inventory analysis significantly reduced the cycle time and distance travelled in searching 
and picking activities. 
 
Using the quality function deployment, systematic layout planning and systems simulation showed that “U” flow 
material layout design is the best layout design alternative. The results showed that material warehouse performance 
based on minimized total travel distance and time can be improved for class A, B, C, AB, AC, BC and ABC materials 
using the “U” flow material layout design. Simulation results indicated that the combined techniques offer significant 
improvement to the existing layout design. The average reduction in cycle time for both companies resulted in 40.8% 
decrease and resulted in 5.5% decrease in average travel distance.  
 
Finally, using Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) showed a significant 
improvement in the facility design by applying the “U” flow material layout. The estimated benefit for the proposed 
“U” flow based on cost benefit analysis amounts to PhP 622,711,852.10. The estimated benefits are greater than the 
estimated cost thus the proposed action is potentially advisable and should be further evaluated as a realistic 
opportunity. For FMEA, “U” flow material warehouse layout design shows that only congestion is the possible risk 
that may be encountered if the layout design is implemented while potential risks for “Through” flow material 
warehouse layout design are congestion, longer travel distance and security risk.  
 
Therefore, the researchers recommend the “U” flow material warehouse layout design for BSCI and CAPDI 
companies. The layout design has two separate doors for incoming and outgoing materials, one designated receiving 
area, one designated shipping area, one designated receiving staging area, one designated shipping staging area, 
storage area, equipment area and office. Materials flow in at receiving area, move in to the storage area and then to 
the shipping area in a “U” line flow. The proposed layout design significantly reduced the cycle time and travel 
distance for order picking activity.

Abstract 
This article presents an overview on the awareness of healthcare practitioners have on medical waste 
produced in the health environment in the South African Republic. An analysis of the literature was 
conducted to identify a gap within published articles between the years 2013 to 2018 that are relevant to 
health care waste practices covered by various researchers in the health sector. Many authors emphasize on 
the importance of following proper procedures when it comes to handling health care waste and also 
highlight continuous training programs of health care practitioners on waste management. It is 
recommended that the South African Department of Health should play an active role in ensuring that the 
health care practitioners follow the standard waste management procedures in place. 
Keywords: health care waste, health care practitioners, hazardous waste 
1. Introduction
1.1 Background of the Study 
In an effort to save people’s lives, the health care sector produce various hazardous materials to the environment which 
in turn harmful to the people whom it care for. It has been indicated that unmanaged waste management in the health 
care can be harmful to the surrounding and can be very gravely to the community (Sanjeev et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2014; 
Ghasemi and Yusuff, 2015). Inadequate management of health care waste is mainly caused by lack of finances, shortage 
of human resources and most importantly improper management of waste in the health care sector, which has been a 
big consent to hospitals and communities as a whole (Bhardwa and Joshi 2016; Sharma et al. 2013). 
The dental sector within the health care can have damaging effects, such as used disposable items, chemical waste, and 
infectious wastes just to mention a few (Sanjeev et al., 2014).  The sector produces a variety of materials that have 
contaminated fluids (Sharma et al., 2013). In as much as recent amendments have been made in the waste management 
programs to administer waste management in health care (Sanjeev et al., 2014; Thakur and Ramesh, 2016) and global 
awareness programs have been raised, as indicated by Sharma et al. (2013), unfortunately the global wastage in the 
health care has not seen a decrease. However, South African government has recognized the gravely threat of improper 
handling of the health waste and set regulations to regulate the problem (Ghasemi and Yusuff, 2015). Nevertheless, 
research shows that the management of waste in the health care has been quite a challenging task (Nemathaga et al. 
2008; Hangulu and Akintola, 2017). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the knowledge 
of health care practitioners with regards to healthcare waste handling in South Africa. 
1.2 Rationale and Scope of the Study 
The South African Department of Health and the South African National Standards (SANS) have determined that 
improvement in the primary health care along with how waste is handled in the sector through re-engineering the 
processes (Hangulu and Akintola, 2017). Above 90% of South African waste produced in health care are burnt, 
whereas wastes that are considered as non-toxic are openly dump in open spaces (Nemathaga, et al., 2008). The 
knowledge of health practitioners with regards to how medical waste can be best handled can go a long way in reducing 
the risks this practice produces (Elnour et al., 2015).

Abstract 
With the increasing pressure and competition from global forces on trade industries, supply chains, 
transportation and shipment, many countries have adopted the use of Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory systems. 
Over the years, many organizations have tried to use JIT to manage their inventory management systems 
and reduce costs related to inventory. This makes the technique the mostly tried system in inventory 
management. This research paper is based on assessing organizations within South Africa and the 
application of Just in Time Technique as a tool to manage inventory. By using this tool, cost can be reduced, 
and this is one of the advantages of using JIT. JIT is a Japanese philosophy, so it was established and 
developed in Japanese culture. Organizations that are not Japanese are therefore inclined to modify certain 
aspects of JIT to fully and seamlessly integrate it into their manufacturing process. This study will assess 
how South Africa have adopted the Philosophy and modified it to fit in cultures in both manufacturing and 
service industries. The research design that will be used is explanatory research. A correlational study will 
be done. The setting in which this study will be done is the normal setting of production, using analysis 
tools the impact of JIT will be assesses based on results and make recommendations.

1. Introduction
In the nick of time (JIT) is an assembling reasoning that was produced by the Japanese. It is centered around 
streamlining generation effectiveness by finding the harmony among quality and amount to portray a stylish perfect 
(Wyk and Naidoo, 2016). This logic was first connected in the 1970's. Taiichi Ohno first created it at Toyota. Initially 
JIT was actualized essentially to guarantee the conveyance of merchandise to clients precisely, with respect to request 
time, item quality and amount. In any case, this comprehension and utilization of JIT has turned out to be increasingly 
mind boggling in the ongoing years. JIT is currently a key player in guaranteeing that generation of products happens 
with least waste. Toyota being one of the main cars makes, following quite a while of consistent enhancement, went 
to an acknowledgment that there are seven kinds of waste constantly present in assembling. These squanders result 
from: overproduction, misuse of holding up time, transportation squander, process squander, stock waste, misuse of 
movement and waste from item deserts (Suzaki, 1989).  
JIT contains eight (8) components which incorporate consistent enhancement, disposing of waste, great housekeeping, 
setup time decrease, leveled/blended generation, Kanban, Jidoka and Andon. Japan is known for its real fares of cars, 
buyer gadgets and PCs, therefore it ought not to come as an unexpected that it was the Japanese that created and 
reasoning that would reform the manner in which the world does assembling and handle stock. The world has been 
watching, taking in and actualizing different methods of insight from the Japanese with regards to assembling and JIT 
is one of those rationalities.

Company X comprises of two distinct production plants whereby the one plant implements JIT, whereas the other 
plant does not. The collection of primary data, for the purpose of this study, was done through structured questionnaires 
which were chosen and administered to the various technical staff as well as senior staff located at each plant. The 
questionnaires targeted a total of 120 employees and were distributed to 60 employees from both plants, with a total 
response rate of 30%. Primary data was utilized to contrast the profit generated from a production line that implements 
JIT as opposed to a production line that does not operates using JIT technique.  
Equally considered is the secondary data obtained from the financial records from Company X’s production plants. 
This was performed in order to ascertain the rate of returns from sales, rework, as well as profit from the different 
lines of production (Wyk & Naidoo, 2016).  
When it came to inventory saving at Company X, it was noted that Company X need to secure supplies of goods in 
small lot sizes contrary to their normal large lot production sizes. Small sizes production was enabled by reducing set 
up time. It has been found that the result of smaller batch sizes in JIT production leads to quality being improved, 
inventory being reduced, costs associated with manufacturing considerably dropping, a market that responds better, 
and lastly service that becomes faster in terms of the delivery of products. 
What happened at Company X was that with the assignment of little groups of data, employees at the lowest level 
could start taking a shot at various periods of the plan while the last structure was being created. Steady downward 
delegation of guidelines at Company X diminished vulnerability among workers and expanded the rate of issue 
identification. With respect to benefit examination between the JIT and non-JIT plants, the JIT fabricating plant 
demonstrated an expansion in benefit. The majority of the waste variables added to the expansion net benefit on 
account of Company X. The execution of JIT likewise expanded the accessibility of employments at the organization. 
The likelihood of occupation dissemination in JIT manufacturing made chances to enhance work improvement 
experienced by representatives and open doors for employment expansion.

Given the major improvements at Company X and Hewlett-Packard, it is clear to see that JIT manufacturing is 
beneficial and can work across cultural spheres. It is recommended that South African SME’s look into implementing 
JIT as it will be advantageous to the firms. Based on the results obtained the analysis of the case study on Company 
X, it has been demonstrated that JIT manufacturing application has a relationship that is proportional in a direct fashion 
to the firm’s productivity and eventually the country’s productivity. Mention can be made of JIT system elements 
inter relationship that is vital for a successful implementation of JIT system as depicted in Figure 2. 
 
The objectives of this research paper were to (1) Identify the impact that JIT has had on South African SME’s (positive 
or negative) and (2) Investigate if JIT is an applicable philosophy for South African SME’s. After all the research has 
been conducted, it has been reached that companies in the Republic of South Africa are testing the application of Just-
In-Time production and are eventually displaying enormous improvements, both in monetary terms and in the loyalty 
displayed by their customers including the morale of their workforce.  JIT production has provided an influence that 
is positive on small businesses productivity in South Africa. It is a simple and applicable philosophy to follow, with 
many benefits to reap. 
 
Further research should be conducted within the South African SME’s sector comprising of manufacturing companies 
by including larger samples in various locations to investigate the impact JIT manufacturing has on the company’s 
cultures as well as on productivity in relation to the country’s economy.

Lately, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is considered a commitment and responsibility of a 
company to reduce the harmful effects from their manufacturing process and giving a good impact for society and 
environment. Some brands have really good CSR values and transparency and some don’t. This research is a good 
way to investigate whether consumer purchasing behaviour is influenced by particular brands’ ethical and social 
responsibility or not. Qualitative methods was used for this study, and for the data collection, semi-structured 
interviews were used.  The consumers were informed about each of companies’ CSR activities in the middle of 
answering the questions in questionnaires and interviews. The objectives of this research are to investigate the 
influence CSR actions of certain fashion brands on their reputation (from consumers’ point of view), and also to 
determine the impact of their reputation on customer buying/purchasing behaviour. The findings of this study was 
intended to investigate whether CSR influenced the consumer's purchasing behaviour.

1.Introduction
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the fashion industry has been very popular lately in the past10 
years. The businesses role is no longer focused on gaining profit only, but also focused on being actively responsible 
towards the society (Harrison and Freeman, 1999).  It has gained much attention and publicity from media all across 
the world. Mohr et al (2001) believed that CSR is a commitment and responsibility of a company to reduce the 
harmful effects from their manufacturing process and giving a good impact for society and environment. CSR can 
involve range of actions like building good relationship with local communities, investing in schools/ community 
activities, ensuring their employees’ welfare like giving them health insurances for them and their family, also 
taking part in protecting the environment. Nowadays, companies seem to compete each other in showing their 
concern for environmental and social ethical issues like global warming, factory waste, inadequate working 
condition, child labor, etc. transparently. Brands like Marks & Spencer, New Look, and H&M, even have specific 
website for their contributions in sustainability and social responsibilities. These companies are trying to show their 
transparency in ethical issues to their customers by kindly and transparently showing the customers about their 
recycling activities (UNIQLO “Fleece Recycling Program”), sustainability plans (M&S “Plan A”), workers welfare 
(New Look “Modern Slavery Statement)”, their supply chain, their stores and factories location, etc. This might 
happen because according to Folkes and Kamins (1999), unethical behavior of companies had bad impact on 
costumer attitudes, even though the brands / the products were good. No companies want to be boycotted because of 
‘bad reputation’, but unfortunately not all companies are willing to participate in social environment and being 
socially responsible. However, companies with great ethical behaviour which provides transparency and do CSR 
activities not always being rewarded.  
It has been confirmed that consumers do appreciate products with good ethical value. Over the last decade, 
ethical consumerism has become trend and widened to mainstream society (Shaw et al,2006). Nevertheless, many 
consumers remain buying products from companies they choose without thinking about companies’ ethical value 
and social responsibility.  This might happened because lack of knowledge the consumers have about the companies 
they buy the products from. Another research also indicated that not all of consumers are willing to pay more for 
product just because it has a good ethical value. For example, McDonalds’ attempt to use only free-cage eggs for

Figure 2 shows the consumer buying process in the context of CSR. This diagram is modified by the researcher, but 
the original is based on Armstrong and Kotler’s diagram (2013) for the theory of consumer’s buying process in 
general.   
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, this research shows that the CSR does influence consumer’s purchase behaviour, even though it 
doesn’t influence all people. According to these participants, there are many things to be considered other than CSR. 
Purchasing products from company with good CSR also make the consumers feel relieved and satisfied. This feeling 
also makes these consumers want to repurchase the brand. Although there is only 1 person’s buying behaviour that 
is directly influenced by CSR, but all of the participants agreed that buying from company that has good CSR make 
them feel relieved and safe. In other words, CSR can build brand trust, indirectly. A brand should think about their 
CSR activities, as well as the quality and design. When all of the factors are fulfilled, the brand will be successful 
and will be able to influence the customer to be more aware ethically. 
 
7. Recommendation 
 
This research was done by interviewing the general customers without asking about their age, occupations, status. 
For a deeper research, further research can be done to analyze deeper about the demographics factor that influence 
CSR Awareness (such as age, gender, jobs, ethnicity etc.) Maturity level in every age is different and CSR 
awareness in people from developing and developed country also different.

Abstract 
Current practices utilize chokes in the wellhead to induce a pressure drop in high production gas wells to produce at 
a constant rate. Consequently, in this setup, the potential for this pressure to be made useful is lost. In contrast, the use 
of a turbo-expander could induce this same necessary pressure drop while simultaneously utilizing it to generate 
energy. To estimate the potential benefits of this modified system, some assessments were made. 
All tests conducted in this investigation utilized the thermodynamic property tables of pure methane to model the 
performance of produced reservoir gases. The first test conducted attempted to model the amount of mechanical energy 
lost across a typical choke at varying pressure ratios and flow rates. The second test modelled the theoretical energy 
that could be harvested across a turbo-expander. Using the relationships deduced between pressure ratio and power 
generated across a turbo-expander an equation relating the two parameters was derived. This equation was then applied 
to a case study representing a high producing gas well in the Middle East region to appraise the effectiveness of turbo-
expander use on wells of this caliber. Reservoir parameters were estimated based upon parameters typically found in 
the region and were then used to create a production forecast for one well. The results of this case study indicate that 
expansion use in gas wells with production rates of roughly 100 MMSCFD/well show an average power generation 
of 2.2 MW/D/well in a five-year span towards the middle of the plateau production region. Over an entire production 
plateau and at some different wells, the power generation benefits of turbo-expander use could greatly improve the 
energy efficiency of gas production wells.

Introduction 
Energy demands worldwide continue to grow at a staggering rate. In fact, in the past three decades, global energy use 
has doubled (Chauvin, 2008). The oil and gas industry has a major role to play in response to this growing need. 
Therefore, it is imperative that the industry achieves this in the most energy-efficient manner possible. It is often 
overlooked that the oil and gas industry itself is a major consumer of energy. Large amounts of energy are spent in 
the exploration, extraction, refining, and delivery of oil and gas (Chauvin, 2008). This process, in its current state, is 
certainly economical with roughly “10 percent of gross oil and gas production” consumed by the industry. However, 
with the poor current market price of oil, at the moment, any efficiency improvement, at any scale of operations, would 
be of great value to the industry. Also, the relatively negative stigma surrounding oil and gas operations sparked by a 
growing climate change concern incentivize the need to become more energy efficient.

Conclusion 
Based on the models tested, the mechanical energy lost across a choke is less than the energy that can be harvested in 
a turbo-expander. This is a result of the fact that the choke model only accounts for the transport energy lost and does 
not quantify the energy that is transformed into internal energy. An increase in pressure ratio and flow rate will increase 
energy loss and consequently the amount of energy that can be harvested through expansion. 
 
Turbo-expander outlets are subject to an increased temperature drop than usual due to the enhance Joule Thompson 
effect. In the industry this can lead to complications such as hydrate formation and condensate drop out. In order to 
avoid this the fluid needs to be pre or post heated. In high producing gas wells such as those in the Middle East, in a 
five year span at a constant plateau rate of roughly 100 MMSCF/D/well the average power generated is 2.19 
MW/D/well.

Abstract: 
This research aims to determine community participation in financing education in Gorontalo Province by using a 
mixing approach  method combining quantitative and qualitative methods known as combination research called 
concurrent embedded. 
The results of this research about the dynamics of community participation in financing education compared to 
public participation has been experiencing declining. The decline occurs in Gorontalo, in line with the incessant 
campaign against extortion and free education programs in various local governments. 
Society and parents view that financing has been fulfilled through the State budget (APBN) budget, namely in the 
form of school operational assistance (BOS), with education policies for the people (PRODIRA) carried out by the 
Gorontalo provincial government, as well as the regency and city governments of Gorontalo Province . 
Currently education funding from the BOS budget, and PRODIRA has been fulfilling the policy of education equity, 
but not being able to improve the quality of education as the expectations of education stakeholders. For that reason, 
a good solution for improving the quality of education, the support and participation of the community and parents 
of students in financing education is still needed, especially from the upper middle class who has higher income.

If we pay attention to schools that are funded by the community with adequate tariffs, it is even more developed and 
advanced and has high competitiveness of graduates. Another way to increase the participation of the community 
and parents of students, according to Supoyo (2015: 7-9) exemplifies SD Ta’mirul Islam Surakarta where the 
participation of parents and surrounding communities is very high due to the accountability of school financial 
management. School accountability through transparency can encourage parents' participation in education funding. 
The values of openness in financial management are also in line with Radu's view (2011) cited from his research 
entitled ""Parental involvement in schools: A study of resources, mobilization, and inherent inequality"" concluded: 1) 
there are two factors that clearly influence participation and involvement of the community and parents of students 
in school education. These factors are the feeling of being able to be from the community and parents of students 
and the efforts to raise the funds made by the school; 2) Mobilization carried out by the school can increase the 
involvement of the community and parents of students in financing education education which has an impact on 
increasing equity and the quality of education in higher education. 
4. CONCLUSION 
The amount of education costs provided by the central government through the School Operational Assistance 
(BOS) and the Gorontalo Provincial Government through the People's Education Program (PRODIRA) provides 
benefits to education equity to the levels of high school, vocational and MA education to remote areas, but on the 
other hand creates a new phenomenon in the form of a decrease in the participation of the community and parents of 
students in financing education. Ideally education is the responsibility of the government, the community and 
parents of students. To boost the participation of the community and parents of the students, the Gorontalo local 
culture approach, namely huyula culture, mutual assistance, mutual assistance and transparency in financial 
management. The support of education costs from the community and parents will accelerate the superior vision and 
program of the Gorontalo provincial government, namely quality education will be more quickly realized.

Abstract 
This study is about a multi item inventory control model which is developed to optimize the total inventory cost and 
inventory layout management. Prioritizing environmental pollution as an integral part of inventory management, 
equivalent carbon emission cost is also considered in the proposed inventory control model. Assuming limited number 
of orders where no shortage is allowed, the raw material inventory control model is designed. The objective of this 
study is to minimize the inventory cost by determining economic order quantity (EOQ) and to minimize the use of 
storage space for the inventory. In order to solve the nonlinear programming model, a metaheuristic algorithm named 
multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm is proposed.

1. Introduction
Effectiveness of inventory management is generally measured under the basis of responsiveness and cost. Both of 
these key concepts have different meanings in different stages of operation in an organization. In broader sense, 
inventory means finished goods or goods kept in different stages of production until goods are sold or converted into 
finished products. It can be located inside the organization’s premise or at a different place supervised by a third party. 
According to Stevenson (2014) inventory can be classified into raw material, work in process and finished goods 
inventory. In this paper an inventory control model for raw material inventory is proposed. Most of the classical 
inventory control models are developed assuming that a single buyer purchase or store a single item. But nowadays 
this assumption does not hold as most of the companies are interested in purchasing multiple item at a time and 
attracting a wide range of customers. According to Lenard and Roy (1995) a multi-item model is often necessary, 
especially when the number of items is very large. This work showed that a large gap exists between theory and 
practice in inventory control and to solve this a multi-criteria approach was needed.   
In day-to-day business operation selecting an economic order quantity (EOQ) and minimizing total space requirement 
is not easy. EOQ comes with many strategic decisions to be made in every phase of supply chain network like 
determination of ordering items and order quantities. Again, with the increasing awareness about environmental 
pollution, more rules and regulation are imposed on business organizations. Green purchasing and suppliers’ 
environmental performance have become important issues to improve environmental sustainability.  So, at present a 
multi-objective inventory optimization can make a significant contribution to an organization’s profit as well as 
increase its return on total assets. 
2. Literature Review
A substantial amount of work has already been done on multi-item inventory control model in different researches. A 
dynamic single stage multi-item inventory control model was proposed by Ould-Louly and Dolgui (2001) where the 
aim was to determine the average holding cost and stockout probabilities for the components considering a given

The results obtained with the optimal level of parameters and the one with Pareto front of MATLAB formulation show 
no difference. It means that MOPSO is capable of finding best result for the proposed inventory control model. 
7. Conclusion and recommendation for future work 
In this paper a multi-item inventory control problem with limited budget was investigated with the goals of minimizing 
both the total inventory cost and total required storage space. Independent demand rates of items with shortage 
considering no volume discount. The aim was to determine optimal order quantity such that objective function is 
minimized and constraints hold. The developed nonlinear programming model was solved by Pareto based multi-
objective particle swarm optimization algorithm. Taguchi L9 design was applied to calibrate the parameters of the 
algorithm and the combination that best suited to the objective was chosen.  
Some recommendations for future work are to develop a probabilistic model using fuzzy and stochastic demand, to 
consider volume discount, lead time uncertainty, defective items, inflation and time value of money and other 
performance metrics and to apply recently developed meta-heuristic nature inspired algorithms to solve the problem.

Abstract 
Failure Detection and diagnosis is critical for maintaining the health of a system. Therefore, most of the 
production industries today try to follow Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) which works on the strategy 
that monitors the actual condition of the asset to decide what maintenance needs to be done. CBM monitors 
the health of the mechanical components through measurements of different kinds of sensor data such as 
vibration, temperature and pressure, etc. By using this status data, it can be determined whether maintenance 
is required or not indicated by decreasing performance or upcoming failure. Compared with preventive 
maintenance, this increases the time between maintenance repairs, because maintenance is done on an as-
needed basis. In this research, we employ Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to recognize the different health 
states of a mechanical component. The transition between states is probabilistic in HMM which helps in 
estimating the future state of the component. The proposed health state estimation method has been 
validated on a time-series sensor signal of compressors.

Abstract 
Abstract- This study aims to development of educational process capability maturity model, which can be applied 
in the higher education sector for quality and process improvement in educational services. A new model is 
established by adopting a philosophy and concepts of the Quality Management Maturity Model for Crosby and 
Maturity Model CMM-based Software, as well as, using the critical successful factors in higher education.  
     Currently, a majority of higher educational organizations need to develop an approach or model for measuring 
their educational process capability maturity due to the global challenges that affected this sector.  In addition to the 
strong competitive environment that required to keep going with this continues improvement and achieve a higher 
level of performance. Such as these challenges have been imposed on the higher education organizations to evaluate 
their performance and level of the quality service in order to obtain a high maturity level. Previous studies indicated 
there is a lack of maturity model in the education sector because most of currently maturity models have designed 
for industrial sector or electronic learning processes.  For this reason, this study has suggested developing a maturity 
model which can be exact in the higher education sector and improve their quality process. This study will discuss 
implementation of the maturity model in the higher education organizations.

1. Introduction
Higher education organizations are considered to be a complex community because of the c characteristics of
their service. Although the majority of industrial and services organizations are suffering from similar global 
challenges. A higher educational score still has special characteristics which are completely different compared with 
the rest of the production and service sectors. Where, it includes processes, areas and private practices which are 
applied only in the higher education sectors. For this reason, it's required a continuous improvement in order to 
provide an educational service that will satisfy all beneficiaries. There are various methods to improve educational 
processes such as maturity model based software process development (Capacity Maturity Model and Integrated 
Maturity Model). Hence, several models have been formulated from these modes and used to measure 
organizational capacity, which it has been applied in various and different areas such as; Total quality management, 
relationship with suppliers, research and development, product reliability, knowledge management and governance

7. Conclusion 
     In this study, the model presented and developed for the Maturity of the Capability of the educational process can 
be tested in the higher education organizations as a self-assessment tool to identify the areas of strength and 
weakness in its operations, which were distributed on five levels including critical success factors in higher 
education to determine the actual location of the educational organization within. The five maturities levels and 
begin to prioritize improvement to move to a level of maturity above the current level. The educational organization 
whose level of maturity is in the second level will improve to move to the third level of maturity, which falls within 
the third level, will want to move and improve to a higher level, the fourth. If it is in the fourth level, you want to 
move to the highest level of maturity, which is the fifth. As the educational organization decides to make 
improvements, the results of applying the model will serve as the cornerstone for improving the performance of its 
operations as follows: 
 
-Preparation for the evaluation process: requires the organization to understand the mechanism of application of 
the model and levels, as well as the focus areas for each of the five levels. 
-Selection and formation of a resident team supported by senior management, training them to understand the 
model levels, and on how to use the model as an assessment tool. 
-Prepare the necessary inputs for evaluation and determine the time period for completion of the evaluation 
process. 
- Implementation of the evaluation process by the Maturity Model of the educational process. 
-Analyze the results of the evaluation by the resident team and prepare a list of results. 
- The evaluation team shall prepare a report showing the organization's current location within (the five maturity 
levels) and the main areas at each level that it has not met, with a diagnosis of strengths and weaknesses. 
-Develop an improvement plan, to improve the current level and move to a later maturity level.

Abstract  
Special Education (SPED) was established to meet the needs of children with different types of disabilities and other 
special needs, and designed to adhere to necessities which mass education was incapable to support. In the Philippines, 
there are 648 public SPED centers nationwide (DepEd, 2017) and each center has the authority to determine which 
activities to implement and how much budget should be allocated for each activity. Department of Education (DepEd) 
obliged each SPED center to utilize the apportioned percentage of the great subsidy for student development activities 
to ensure that the needs of the children will be provided. Therefore, accurate decision making in prioritizing student 
development activities for SPED is necessary to ensure that the allocation of funds in each center is geared towards 
the goals and objectives of the central SPED unit. However, based on data, selection of activities and allocation of 
budget per activity varies among centers since the current system of each center regarding prioritization of activities 
and allocation of budget was not clearly defined because no certain basis has been established. Therefore, prioritization 
of activities and allocation of resources must be developed. Given this condition, the researchers aim to formulate a 
priority-based financial allocation model for student development activities in SPED centers. Using statistical analysis, 
the researchers were able to identify significant factors that must be considered in formulation of model such as (a) 
number of students served (b) number of activities implemented (c) types of disabilities catered and (4) amount of 
funds received.

1. Introduction
Special Education (SPED) started in the Philippines in 1907. It was established to meet the needs of children with 
different types of disabilities and other special needs, and designed to adhere to necessities which mass education was 
incapable to support. Many children with disabilities are unwilling to participate in activities that would benefit them 
because they are insecure, embarrassed, or lack confidence in their skills, perceived or real (Desotelle, 2008). They 
tend to withdraw from society, therefore development of their physical and motor skills, social skills and intellectual 
skills rely mainly on the programs and services of SPED centers. Thus, the Department of Education obliged each 
SPED center to utilize the apportioned percentage of the grant subsidy for student development activities as to ensure 
that these children will be exposed to educational visits, camp activities, sports activities, students training and other 
SPED related activities. However, although financial subsidy is provided, public financing of education is almost 
always inadequate and rarely able to cover all necessary expenses (Behrman, Deolalikar & Soon, 2001).   
Issues on financing education most likely to occur as educational agencies increased their programmatic commitments 
to special education whereas these commitments have resulted to a need of large sums of money (Favel, 1988). 
Meanwhile, in the master thesis that covers selected special schools in Metro Manila, it was stated that financial costing 
should not be an issue. Instead, administrators should carefully plan for cost effectiveness schemes of their school, 
which should be the aim of all forms of education (Lin, 2003). Planning for cost effectiveness within a school brought 
a need to optimally relate financial resources to desired outcomes. The question of how best to achieve goals through 
effective resource allocation became even more critical (Pan, Rudo, Schneider & Hansen, 2003). A management that

4. Conclusion  
  
The main purpose of this paper was to formulate a financial allocation model for student development activities in 
SPED centers. Different approaches using Industrial Engineering tools have been used for this the study. By 
conducting surveys, initial interviews, and acquisitions of historical data for the seven SPED centers under study, the 
researcher has been able to gather enough as a solid reference in creating the corresponding program.  
  
This study began by determining the weight contribution of each student development program in achieving the 
organizational goal. From the result of AHP with the aid of Expert Choice software, it can be inferred that the School 
Retention and Promotion Program has a weight contribution of 13.7%, the Basic Program contributes 26.0%, the 
Individual Program contributes with 25.7%, the Local Culture, Arts, Music and Media puts in 15.0% and the Health 
and Physical Development Program puts in 19.6%.  
  
Moreover, this proposed distribution served as a target ratio in computing for the percentage goal achievement. The 
computed percentage goal achievements of the seven SPED centers were as follows: J. Rizal achieved 76.74%, A. 
Albert achieved 72.43%, M. Hizon achieved 51.57%, P. Burgos achieved 66.57%, J. Lukban achieved 63.59%, Fugoso 
achieved 69.92%, and P. Gomez achieved 80.24%. Determination of the current status of SPED centers will be of 
assistance in identifying opportunities for improvement that will be used in the model.   
  
However, prior to the formulation of allocation model, this paper sought to answer whether there are significant 
differences between the percentage goal achievements among centers. With the use of ANOVA, it has been 
statistically proven that there are significant differences. Nonetheless, Tukey’s HSD Test was used to determine 
whether the data is different from all other data or at least one data is different from another. As a result, Albert and 
Lukban, Albert and Hizon, Albert and Burgos, Fugoso and Lukban, Fugoso and Rizal, Fugoso and Hizon, Fugoso and 
Gomez, Lukban and Rizal, Lukban and Hizon, Lukban and Gomez, Rizal and Hizon, Rizal and Burgos, Hizon and 
Burgos, Hizon and Gomez, Burgos and Gomez are all significantly different. To know what causes the differences 
among centers, regression analysis was used wherein the independent variables are the (1) number of students served, 
(2) number of activities implemented, (3) number of types of disabilities catered and (4) the amount of sponsorship 
fund received; the dependent variable is the percentage goal achievement. As a result, it has been proven that the 
above-mentioned independent variables are insignificant predictors of the dependent variable. Thus, it can be deduced 
that significant differences exist due to variations in the prioritization and fund management.  
  
Subsequent to the comparative analysis, a goal programming model was formulated given the following constraints: 
Budget Constraint, Student Development Program Weight Contribution Constraint, Percentage Goal Achievement 
Constraint, Expense Constraint, Activity Priority Constraint and Population Priority Constraint. With the aid of Lingo 
13.0 software, the following results were generated: A. Albert can be optimized by 8.07%, Fugoso can be optimized 
by 30.078%, J. Lukban can be optimized by 30.08%, J. Rizal can be optimized by 22.36%, M. Hizon can be optimized 
by 28.93%, P. Burgos can be optimized by 33.42% and P. Gomez can be optimized by 19.75%. This would mean that 
the current allocations for the aforementioned SPED centers were not optimally aligned with the organizational goal 
and objectives of the central SPED unit as opportunities for improvement were generated.  
  
From the formulated model, a post optimal analysis was conducted wherein the researcher identified the critical 
variables that would result to a significant penalty in the objective function once it was introduced again. It is evident 
that all of the critical variables are part of the Student Development Program Weight Contribution Constraint. It can 
be inferred that the aforementioned constraint takes control of the model in view of the fact that this constraint limits 
the other goal constraints that are subsequent to it from being satisfied as seen during the model validation. Also, any 
changes to the variables affiliated to the abovementioned constraint will result to a significant increase in the objective 
function.   
  
Moreover, a Lingo code was created and directly linked to MS Access to allow intended users to run the model and 
generate results of their own. This allows ease of use and serves as a tool to make every financial decision simple, 
straight-forward and trouble-free, yet ensuring that each decision is aligned with the organizational goal and objectives 
of the central SPED unit.

Abstract 
From research findings, it was found that knowledge level had a relationship with knowledge 
management in rice planting of farmers, but age, educational level, paddy farm size, farm income from rice, rice 
planting experiences, training experience and extension contact had no relationship with knowledge management 
on rice planting at all. From a comparative study, it was found that there was no difference in farmers’ knowledge 
in each Sub-district. Nakornchum Sub-district had total average knowledge score higher than that in  Baankaeng 
Sub-district and Mae Koa Tom Sub-district. From the comparison of farmers’ knowledge management between 
each Sub-district, it was found that there was no difference at all. 
Problems and obstacles of farmers were the high cost of production leading to the loss of profit, therefore 
the farmers were in need of training on using fertilizers, “Good Agricultural Practice” (GAP) in planting organic 
rice, plant protection to increase yield per rai and the use of bio-extract products in the paddy fields in order to 
reduce production costs. Also, to increase good quality products which will have higher income than present.

1. Introduction
With reference to the cerebration of 81 years old of King Bhumipoladulayadej in 2008 in order to pay 
respect and loyalty to His Majesty and to develop Land Reform Area in the aspects of “Land Reform”, “Farmer 
Reform” and “Management Reform” more concretely by allowing the community to participate in solving their 
problems through people participation process by performing community development activities so as to help 
solving community’s problems in the form of land, farmers and management. The Land Reform Office, Kasetsart 
University and other universities and Local Administration Organizations had also cooperate in this project in 
terms of budget, human resources, body of knowledge by linking body of knowledge of the university to create 
development innovations. Land Reform Office had supported budget, personnel, area-based information and 
mapping as well as various activities involved. Local Administration Organization also supported budget, 
personnel and other local organizations. Operational driver approach by using mechanism called “Five mechanism 
network” which consisting of government sector, educational institutes, private sector, local organizations and 
farmers by utilizing the power of farmers to think and build up the community together so as to set up “Sub-
district Model of Development” in each Sub-district in the Land Reform area by following “The Philosophy of 
Sufficiency Economy” to be the development approach under the fifth of “The WIN-Win Relationship Project” 
in the land Reform areas. 
This plan was to develop individual Sub-district in 65 provinces. There were 81 Sub-districts all together 
to set up the model and to change community development into 3 dimensions, namely, “Knowledge”, “Attitude” 
and “Understanding”. Knowledge was evaluated by attitudinal change in occupations and way of life. As far 
understanding, it was assessed by structural adjustment of land use in each plot. Concerning skill, it was evaluated 
by the increase of individual income in order to set up networking system into 5 linkages between government

5.Income from rice growing had no relationship with farmers’ knowledge management in rice planting. 
That is, run through farmers earned high- or low-income farm rice, they would have no difference in knowledge 
management. This may be because farmers never thought that good have problems in planting rice. In fact, farmers 
do need assistance from extension workers, but they did not have willingness to receive advice on GAP from the 
extension workers from the beginning. This is the reason why extension contact did not have any effect to farmers’ 
knowledge management. 
5. Conclusion 
This research enables to show basic data, knowledge management in planting rice as well as to know the 
problems and obstacles of farmers concerning Win-Win Relationship Project in the Land Reform zone in Northern 
Thailand. All of these data and information can be used for planning the project in the aspect of “Farm Reform”, 
giving knowledge concerning planting rice to farmers in the area where the farmers did not practice it properly. 
Besides, this research will enable the farmers to understand “knowledge management” than before.

Abstract  
The Philippines is the world leading exporter when it comes to Coconut Sugar. The export market for this product 
currently on its high. This study aimed to determine the long-term demand for Coco Sugar, establish factors that affect 
the supply chain of Coco Sugar and recommend a supply chain management model for Coco Sugar in the Philippines 
that would accommodate all the current and potential demand of this product. The Camarines Sur is the highest coconut 
sugar producing province in Luzon that is why this province became the research locale of this study. To achieve all 
the objectives, survey and interview were conducted among the key players of the supply chain. Related literatures 
were reviewed to establish basis for the demand modelling and its projection. Forecasting methods were also used to 
project the long-term demand of the product. The analysis on the statistical tools resulted to the significant factors that 
affect the supply chain of coconut sugar. These factors were prioritized in the establishment of supply chain 
management plan. Also, root cause analysis was done to furthermore dig into the problems in the supply chain. Each 
stages of the supply chain come up with resolutions corresponding to each complications of the key players. Solutions 
to these problems were established, thus, generating a better value chain map of Coconut Sugar. An elimination of 
one chain player, the consolidator was one of the changes made in the Value Chain Map. The eliminated consolidators 
were converted into processors. This better version of value chain map offers cheaper price of Coconut Sugar at a 
larger range of market which not only caters local demand, but also the international ones.

1. Introduction
The Philippines remains as the world’s leading supplier of traditional coconut products. The coconut industry is a 
dominant sector of the Philippine agriculture. Over a quarter of the farmland in the Philippines is devoted to coconut 
planting and 68 out of 79 provinces are coconut areas. The industry is finding more products from the “tree of life” 
and one of these is the coconut sugar. The coconut sugar is a natural sugar that came from the coconut sap and is made 
from pure sweet watery sap that drips from cut flower buds of organically grown, fresh coconut tree. Sugar from sugar 
cane is the most popular and commercially produced and distributed sugar in the Philippines. An emerging, but yet 
relatively unknown sugar now in the market is one from coconut, known as coco sugar. It is derived from coco sap 
which is also the main source of traditional products such as tuba (coconut toddy), lambanog (liquor distilled from 
toddy) and vinegar (Ledesma et al, 1993).  The product map of sap is shown in figure 1 below.

farmers willing to engage in coco sugar 
production  
  
In eliminating the consolidators, financial support must be needed by the new and current processors and the 
organizations listed in the table above are capable of providing financial assistance to the consolidators that will be 
converted to processors. Also, the Coconut Republic will lead in the assistance needed by the processors on the 
production process. Warehouses of consolidators will be converted to production facility.  
 
  
Figure 8. Recommended Value Chain Map of Coco Sugar  
  
The new value chain map provided a more competitive price of coconut sugar which at the same time, gave a large 
profit contribution to all the key players. The consolidators are now converted to processors making the price of 
Coconut Sugar lower. From a retail price of Php330.00, the new retail price is Php220.00. The new pricing was 
achieved by lowering the profit share of each player. This leads to a 33.33% decrease in the selling price of the Coconut 
Sugar making the product more attractive. In eliminating the consolidator, the cost of Php9.00 per kilogram was 
reduced. This is 4.09% less of the selling price. The additional cooperative in the sap collection and processors were 
the former consolidators and the potential coco sap suppliers and processors. In eliminating the consolidators, financial 
support must be needed by the new and current processors and the organizations listed in the table above are capable 
of providing financial assistance to the consolidators that will be converted to processors. Also, the Coconut Republic 
will lead in the assistance needed by the processors on the production process. Warehouses of consolidators will be 
converted to production facility.  
  
4. Conclusion  
After thorough and intensive analysis, the researchers were able to conclude that the coconut sugar is a sustainable 
product for it has a high market potential and market growth. Due to promising market on diabetic prevalence, it is 
seen that coconut sugar will be a great substitute for the regular refined sugar and/or the muscovado sugar because of 
the health benefits it provides. Additionally, coconut sugar has already established its market internationally. The 
1358","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Bangkok, 
Thailand, March 5-7, 2019

growing export market will become an advantage to our country. On the other hand, statistical tools and analysis in 
the research study provided the significant factors that affect the price and productivity of coconut sugar. These are 
mainly the number of collections per day during sap collection, coconut sap supply for the processors and for the 
consolidators, the supply of coconut sugar has the greatest impact on the productivity. Planting more dwarf type of 
tree in the area of Bicol and other areas near Manila will help increase the supply of coconut sugar in Metro Manila. 
Proper knowledge in the coconut processing in order to utilize the materials effectively must be disseminated among 
the processors. These are the main focus of the supply chain and have to be developed in order to successfully introduce 
the coconut sugar industry to the market. The supply chain management plan aims to deliver coconut sugar to 
consumers wherever and whenever they want and need it. Increase in the number of consolidators is suggested and 
investors for this industry must be persuaded to fund the financial needs to be able to reach the primary market which 
is the Metro Manila. Also, there is a lack of endorsements and advertisement for the product that is why only few 
consumers are patronizing it right now. The retailers and processors must come up to marketing plan that will introduce 
coconut sugar to the market. Surely, the market growth of the product will be achieved once the supply chain plan for 
this industry is taken care of appropriately.

Abstract  
Textile industry plays important role in our country's economy. Handloom weaving sector is one of the most 
important sectors, have the potential to produce employment. However, this sector is ignored in terms of 
development. Due to lack of development in this field, the workers were forced to use traditional methods and 
equipment for their task, which was time consuming and hard work. Workers suffered a lot of health problems due 
to the practice of traditional techniques of weaving. This leads to loss of interest by workers in this field and their 
migration to other areas of work. It also seriously affects the socio-economic conditions of rural people. Besides, 
directly or indirectly it does affect the economy. It is also very time-consuming task. So, an ergonomic and technical 
improvement was important for upgrading traditional weaving. This work identified the issues with traditional 
weaving process of  Maheshwar handloom sector and propose solution provide a better working condition to the 
workers involved in the Maheshwar handloom weaving sector. Further, the work also focuses to provide a viable 
and feasible solution to reduce ergonomic risk factors and satisfy workers of Maheshwar handloom weaving sector 
by earn profit and also increase productivity and provide efficient work.

 1. Introduction 
Musculoskeletal problems are often related to the handloom weaving process. Design deficiencies often led to many 
problems to the workers and can be seen in the form of bodily pains, Absenteeism, bodily discomfort and job 
turnover. Bodily pains and discomfort tends to be Aggravated by the tasks performed in poor design workstation. 
(Eklund, J. A., 1995). In India excess of 38 million people were utilized in the Handloom weaving area. All through 
the nation and 15,000 local Handloom weaving businesses had been set up in a condition of north and southern parts 
of India. The greater parts of them had a place with low strata of society and were very poor, working in little 
families. Over 40% of weavers were women (Narzary, J., 2013). When modern machines for weaving captured the 
market, handloom market greatly affected and it disturb the Handloom weaver’s life. Due to poor workstation 
design, constrain posture, high muscle exertion and repetitive nature of the weaving task handloom weavers of 
Ahemdabad reported body pains (Nag, A., Vyas, H., & Nag, P. K., 2010). One other study reported that handloom 
weaving process involve repetitive task which was causing pain in the upper limbs among the male handloom 
weavers of West Bengal, India (Banerjee P. & Gangopadhyay S., 2003). 
Maheshwar Handloom owe their name to Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar, the leader of the territory of Indore in the late 
eighteenth century. Maheshwar is a small town in khargone locals of MP State in India where whole study of 
Handloom was done. The weaving business of Maheshwar gave work to around 5000 individuals. Maheshwar 
Handloom Weaver got paid 800-1500 INR to work done by them weekly (Ansari T. M, 2016). It was observed that 
Maheshwar Handloom has same conditions as most parts of the country, their many areas needs to improve and 
update. Most weavers are facing many problems like health, safety, bad environment, and low wages issue.  
A SWOT analysis of Maheshwar Handloom shown in below.

5. Discussion 
Each weaver who was working on the loom complaining about the legs pains and issues related to other body parts. 
Weaver normally worked for 6-7 hours if they work at factory site or workstations. From Direct observation touch 
point led design direction to distribute this work to both feet to make it more comfortable and easy to operate by 
both feet. If it was possible to reduce the standard time so more productivity could be achieved. Also if travelled 
distance of legs decreased than it was more comfortable for weaver. 
6. Conceptualization 
It was found that during shedding step repetitive motion on paddle cause leg muscle pain due to continuous strain 
and load on foot as weaver need to put same energy to continue the process. To solve this complex problem found 
during our study and also from the design direction gathered through the other similar previous study done on the 
handloom suggested design attachment of additional part (Hani U., Das A., 2017) Flywheel was selected to 
overcome this problem where it was connected with the help of push rod which decrease the amount of energy 
applied. Other identified problem was the application of force done by only one foot during the shedding step. Here, 
we applied distribution of load using treadle mechanism. Final concept was prepared after analysing both the 
concepts and integrated them for better performance. 
7. Conclusion 
This study showed that Maheshwar Handcraft sector needed lots of ergonomics intervention. Many people were still 
working in bad condition which caused them health, safety, and financial issues. Initial testing was qualitative, 
importantly the proposed working solution was able to satisfy simulate subject’s more than previous working 
process in discomfort and pain response categories. It could be used in actual working conditions. Design solution 
was portable, low cost and even easy to build with locally available materials, those factors made them more 
acceptable by the Maheshwar weavers. More work can be done in this direction for the device as it cause less 
trouble during the whole process. Still modifications were required.

Abstract 
Equipment failure is a typical problem, and it is difficult to detect it in the current technology-based industry. There 
are many different approaches to diagnostic reasoning such as Rule-based reasoning, model-based reasoning, and 
qualitative model-based reasoning in preventive maintenance. In this paper, we developed a model-based approach 
namely one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect the faults in the oil industry. Real data like pressure and 
temperature readings were collected from sensors which are placed at different parts of machines at each minute.  
Also, failure occurrence of each machine is recorded. Before applying the model, as an initial step, the data (‘n’ 
hours just before the occurrence of a failure) is fine-tuned using Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) 
method to remove the external noise factors which occurred while taking the readings. After fine-tuning the data, 
features like mean, median and peak values were extracted at the time interval of fifteen minutes. These features 
were also extracted using the correlation between sensor values and the information from the people who have 
domain knowledge on these machines. After this, we developed one-class SVM model on the data. We also built 
multiple one-class SVM models by ‘k’ fold cross validation which reduces overfitting. During this process, if the 
model indicates an outlier, it indicates that there is a chance of failure occurrence.

Abstract 
Control rooms are involved with human-computer, human-human and human-machine interactions which are often 
more complex and considered more sociotechnical systems. In SLDC, State Load & despatch Centre, control rooms 
are meant for handling crucial information regarding transmission, generation, distribution of power flow, major to 
remote substations across the state and connected to the central Power Grid system of the country. They handle 
activities ranging from day to day normal transmissions, general operations and distributions, synchronization and 
optimisation of the system, play significant role in balancing frequency and also handle disastrous situations. They 
also predict and plan distribution a year before based on the previous year demand and supply graphs. It includes 
long shift hours, stressful tasks and efficient decision making process for the safe operational flow. An “operator-
first” approach towards the designing of interfaces used in control rooms has been adopted by HFEL (human factors 
and ergonomics literature) and by many other industrial standards (ISO 11064, EEMUA 201, etc.), where the 
designing of interfaces, displays and control room design considered from users perspective, with the operator/user 
being the starting point. Similarly in SLDC, information gathered through implemented SCADA system, provides 
System Overview for easy operation and control through Barco Display Screen.

1. Introduction
Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on the interfaces between computers and users. Mostly HCI 
researchers observe the how human interact with the computers or machines (Juhannsen). Many organizations now a 
days preferring Visual Display Terminals (VDT) screens to either showcase their findings/products or for 
monitoring/investigation purposes. VDT often includes LCD/LED terminals available in flat and curved shape. 
Ergonomics involved in VDT varied from the type of control rooms used in different offices (Bevan, 2001). 
SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system are used by industrial organizations and 
companies in the public and private sectors to control and maintain efficiency, distribute data for smarter decisions, 
and communicate system issues to help mitigate downtime (What is the SCADA system, 2018). Madhya Pradesh 
Power Transmission Company Limited (MPPTCL) is the governing body in state which controls, distribute, 
supervise and channels power across the MP state. It is responsible for governing electricity power generation, 
distribution, testing and setting up of the distribution channels across Madhya Pradesh and other related regions (MP 
Power Transmission Compay ). The central part of operation in State Load & Dispatch Center (SLDC) is Control 
rooms which governs all the operations and production units across other dispatch centers. Thus control rooms play 
significant role in company’s profit or loss conditions. Tasks like early prediction of catastrophic incidents, their 
mitigation opportunities are also handled through the control room display screens which dedicatedly operate 24x7. 
Here the role of Operators comes into the picture who handles these screens, monitor their data values and works 
continuously in long hours in front of computer screen ensuring safety and balance system frequency. Human are 
not very good at monitoring operations and it has also observed that the operators suffered with eye strain, stress, 
repetitive motion impairment and slow response time during abnormal condition events. Barco visual display

Overview screen for gathering exchange related real time data. Banking of surplus amount of energy generation was 
also decided after looking over the System Overview window. Prediction for the next two blocks ,balanced schedule 
cycle running in real time for the demand and generation values were certain factors which were taken into 
consideration during decision making for banking of power to other state or needy organization as well as banking 
for themselves if they were in need of energy from other state /organization. Also found that MP state can generate 
more energy than the state’s scheduled power distribution and hence they were having enough power to sell it. In 
such situations, organization decided to get intimation by SLDCs in advance to manage all distribution and maintain 
the supply. Now it was very clear that how important was to use appropriate grouping of data to make better 
understanding by the user. 
6. Conceptualization 
It was found that data arranged randomly on the screen and not specific colour coding pattern for representation of 
various sections was followed. Results from methodologies have been considered for grouping, data positioning and 
data correlation used during decision making process. Keeping process sequence, frequency of use of data and 
positioning with respect to the data connectivity in mind final concepts were generated both in graphical 
representation as well as only data representation for highly prioritised data.   
7. Conclusion 
Above project work showed the issues related with the information system overview of Barco display screen used at 
SLDC. In this project our main focus was on system overview screen information layout presentation redesign and 
testing of the same. After the final proposed system layout design user ranking test & Likert scale (Rajabi-
Vardanjani, 2014)were performed for a set of 25 working employees of the company and results clearly showed 
need of improvement in the existing design. This study can be used as a reference in future for control room display 
task analysis and layouts designing.

Abstract 
The environmental consequences and depleting trends of fossil fuel reserves has made an earnest requirement of 
wider dissemination of renewable energy resources for power generation. Energy costs from renewables are 
generally higher due to their high initial capital investments. Wind and solar are the two major renewable energy 
resources accounted for 65% of the global total electricity generated from renewables (excluding hydro). Despite 
these two renewable energy resources are relatively evenly distributed over the world and have capabilities to 
counteract environmental challenges, their commercial deployment is limited due to the lack of inclusion of their 
indirect benefits.  This study examines three major indirect benefits from the solar and wind based electricity, i.e. 
emissions, water saving and job creation benefits and figures out how these benefits offset their higher cost per unit 
of electricity. We have found that solar and wind electricity create these benefits in the range of 930–950 
gCO2e/kWh, 0.80–3.12 L/kWh, and 0.10–1.21 person-years/GWh in compare to most common fossil fuel (coal). 
While valuing these benefits, an emission saving of 925 gCO2e/kWh, for example, could offset 2.6 US¢/kWh of 
electricity price for an emission pricing of 40 US$/tonne.  Water and job creation benefits also offset further costs.

1. Introduction
Major fossil fuel resources such as coal, oil and natural gas account for about  85% of the global total primary 
energy supply (Shafiee and Topal 2009). In the current consumption trends, major fossil fuel reserves will be 
diminished within this twenty-first century (Table 1) (Balat and Balat 2009; Shafiee and Topal 2009; WEC 2013). 
The burning of fossil fuels for energy generation also releases GHG (greenhouse gases) emissions and enhances 
climate change. Electricity generation from fossil fuels alone accounted for 50 % of the energy related CO2 
emissions (Bravi et al. 2007).  The depleting trends and release of emissions from fossil fuels are pressing for 
alternative sources for electricity generation. In this context, renewable resources appear as potential alternative to 
counteract the above challenges (Table 2). Wind, photovoltaic, and biomass are the three predominant renewable 
energy resources in the world accounted for 95% of the renewable based electricity (excluding hydro) (REN21 
2015). Among these three major sources, interests in wind and solar are particularly high owing to their  availability 
and environmental cleanliness nature (Dolan and Heath 2012). Although solar and wind resources are relatively 
evenly distributed all over the world and have capabilities to counteract environmental and fossil fuel depletion 
challenges, their dissemination is still limited due to lack of inclusion of their indirect benefits. Emission, water 
saving, and job creation are the three major indirect benefits for renewable-based electricity that are often ignored 
while comparing with fossil-based energy. Assessing and inclusion of these benefits are essential while we make a 
comparison for economic competitiveness of different fossil and renewable sources.

Abstract 
The system studied consists of two parallel factories subject to production rate-dependent failure rates. 
The factories are subject to random non-operational periods considered herein as governed by a 
failure/repair process, and respond to a single product type demand. The main objective here is to propose 
production policies that will minimize the total cost (inventory and backlog costs), over an infinite 
planning horizon. The failure rate of the first factory depends on its production rate, while that of the 
second factory is constant. The proposed model is based on a non-homogeneous Markov decision 
process, and the stochastic dynamic programming approach is used to obtain optimality conditions.

1. Introduction
      Due to the constant search for increased productivity and a better service to clients, the number of scientific 
publications in the field of deteriorating manufacturing systems has been growing steadily. For example, Hu and 
Xiang (1995); Dehayem et al. (2011) and Kazaz and Sloan (2013) studied semi-Markov processes, where the 
assumption is that the system deteriorates with age or number of failures. While this is a reasonable assumption, 
which in some cases provides simple and appealing mathematical solutions, the authors did not address the question 
of what happens if the machine is used to its maximum production capacity for a long period. The problem becomes 
more realistic if the failure rate depends on the production rate. The most important accomplishments of the research 
of Hu et al. (1994) was the investigation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the hedging 
point policy for a single machine, single part-type problem, when the failure rate of the machine is a function of the 
production rate. They showed that hedging point policies are only optimal under linear failure rate functions. Based 
on their discussion, numerical results in the general case suggest that as the inventory approaches a hedging level, it 
may be beneficial to decrease productivity in order to realize gains in system reliability. This conjecture was 
confirmed by the numerical results reported in Martinelli (2007; 2010), and Nourelfath and Yalaoui (2012). 
Kouedeu et al. (2014) extended these preceding works to manufacturing systems consisting of two machines subject 
to a non-homogeneous Markov failure/repair process with production rate-dependent failure rates. The authors 
showed that the hedging point policies are optimal within a four-threshold feedback policy, and that the reliability of 
the machines is also enhanced. They also studied the case of manufacturing systems involving multiple failure rates. 
However, their results were limited to manufacturing systems with a constant demand rate and exponential failures 
and repair time distributions. From a practical point of view, random demand and a non-Markovian process are more 
suited to model manufacturing systems. In this case, the analytical models combined with simulation can be used to 
determine the effects of the factors considered on the incurred cost and to obtain a near-optimal control policy. For 
the application of such a method to a homogeneous non-Markovian process, we refer our readers to Dhouib et al. 
(2010), Gharbi et al. (2011), Rivera-Gomez et al. (2013), and Bouslah et al. (2014).

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we showed that the hedging point policies of a non-homogeneous Markov failure/repair 
manufacturing/remanufacturing system (in which the failure rate of the factory depends on its production rate) are 
optimal among feedback policies, and that the reliability of the factories is enhanced. Applying stochastic optimal 
control theory, we have developed the optimality conditions described by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) 
equations; that we solved numerically with Kushner's approach. The results showed that optimal policies depend on 
system degradation in a closed loop supply chain context. The model presented in this paper could be extended to 
the case of more complex systems (subject to random perturbations described by general distributions) using 
simulation and experimental design.

Abstract (12 font) 
This study aims to explore the innovation process of music composing. The qualitative data built from the 
conservatory of music, this study revealed that the musician that had relatively stable capacity in all four 
areas (generating, communicating, comparing, and interpreting) seem to produce and compose the music 
that combines their existing capabilities on experience and learning from literature and observation. The 
musicians write the music considering the artistic process in generating an idea then comparing with the 
previous compositions. In communicating means, the musicians conduct the brainstorming with peers and 
interpret the form through their self-concept and references. Therefore, the study provides an empirical 
contribution to the emerging work on dynamic capabilities through its in-depth investigation of the skills 
of the seven musicians and by mapping the process of music composing.

Abstract 
This article investigates the influence of lean technique in a manufacturing organization, by analyzing the 
current flow process, identify problem areas implement 5S as one of the lean techniques, and propose a 
more efficient process flow. The methodology that was followed to gather data of was observation and 
interview. It was found that the current flowing process of the replacement department was not well 
structured and consistent with many unnecessary activities. A more efficient and effective flow process was 
proposed through the implementation of lean techniques which led eradicating unnecessary activities in the 
process and re-engineering of the process. Furthermore, it was proposed that future research should be 
based on continues improvement through that application of lean principals.  
Keywords: Lean, competitive advantage, manufacturing organization 
1. Introduction
Lean manufacturing or lean production is a systematic method for waste reduction within manufacturing production 
without losing productivity. Thurston and Ulmer (2016) indicates that many authors considered it as a waste reduction 
technique while maximizing the product value. Lean was originally developed by Toyota with the aim of not only 
reducing waste by also in improving efficiency in their manufacturing processes, however its principles should be the 
engraved in all thriving organizations (Sundar, et al., 2014; Soliman, 2017; Thurston and Ulmer, 2016). Lean 
manufacturing it is a wide-range set of techniques to reduce and eliminate seven wastes, namely: (1) Transport, (2) 
inventory, (3) motion (4) waiting, (5) over-processing, (6) over-production and (7) defects (Kolberg, et al., 2017). 
Furthermore, it provides enormous amount of benefits such as improvements in efficiency, cycle time, productivity, 
material costs, and scrap, all of which leads to lower costs and a better competitive position (Soliman, 2017). It is 
important to indicate that the achievement of acquiring these advantages is in successful implementation of Lean 
principles (Sundara, et al 2014) 
Lean affords elasticity that permits an easy flow of products through reengineering of operations to reduction of lead 
time (Chowdary and George, 2011). Today many organizations have tailored lean for fit their organizational needs by 
integrating and expanding with concepts such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Just-In-Time (JIT), Six Sigma, 
Total Production Maintenance (TPM) and other practices that aim to enhance the organizational ability to perform 
(Netland, 2015).  
It is imperative to indicate that to be able to survive and meet the challenges in a competitive environment, adopting 
lean techniques has turn out to be a necessity to improve flexibility and efficiency of the organization, according to 
Metternich et al. (2013), also to reduce or eliminate waste in their processes (Chowdary and George, 2011; 
Seifermann, et al., 2014). However, Netland (2015) argues that many organizations still fail in the attempt to 
implement lean programs.

Lean tools are an effective way to improve processes with more measurable results (Chiarini, 2014). It is apparent that 
lean provide flexibly that enable manufacturing organizations to re-engineer their processes to improve efficiency 
(Koukoulaki, 2013).   
 
Therefore, it is recommended that Brandable company should train their employees to implementing lean techniques 
in all processes of the organization, this will allow the organization to improve the quality of their processes, eliminate 
wasteful activities and enhance their customer retention. Lastly future research can be focused on continues 
improvements through implementing lean techniques in the manufacturing industries.

Abstract 
E-commerce not only deals online selling and buying but also plays a vital role on supply chain 
management. Apparel manufacturing organizations are suffering gigantic issues regarding receiving 
materials in a timely manner. Consequently, owners have to pay more on airing goods due to poor supply 
chain. The SCM is the spine of E-commerce, a very critical component of E-commerce. Supply chain 
efficiency means having the right product at the right place at the right time, can save money or reduce 
costs, and can enhance cash utilization. E-commerce plays a vital role on inventory management to keep 
the record electronically to avoid any information breach. In this paper, we have developed a database 
management system which would be centrally visualized by the partners of the apparel supply chain. Buyer 
can be able to place orders through this developed database system electronically which might save at least 
ordering cost.

1. Introduction
E-commerce does not just mean trading and shopping on the Internet. It has more important
meaning i.e business efficiency at all operation levels.  The apparel manufacturing organizations
are struggling to survive in the competitive market since labor cost is increasing day by day.
Bangladesh government has been imposed a rule over the entire garments manufacturing industry
that wages must be increase every five years of recess. Government has been declared to increase
51 % wages of the garments workers whereas the cost of manufacturing increasing due to such
kind of incremental matter. Government does not provide any special facility to the industrialist to
cut their overhead cost through there are some of options to be considered in the power supply.
Apart from that movement can be decreased the taxes which incurred on the investor. In addition,
manufacturer not only getting such cost decreasing facilities from the government but also not
enjoying the proper supply of electricity and gas supply from national grid. That is why, owners
have to invest more on alternative power supply which is highly costly. As a result, garments
manufacturing industry is the question of surviving. In this situation, they are focusing on
reduction of cost in different from of view. Improving and making smooth supply chain is one of
that vast area. Manufacturers have to pay more cost for airing shipment due to poor supply chain
management. The reason behind that is the lack of proper information visibility. In order to make
the visible of the information evolving e-commerce into supply chain is the important matter.

8. Conclusions and re-commendations  
It has been shown from figure 2 that apparel chain member will be placing their orders through this central 
database system which would be developed through WordPress database software. Figure 3 depicted that 
when buyer or customer place an order to the manufacturer, usually places it through email confirmation. 
However, in this proposed system orders will be placed in online through using this model and details 
regarding all of the orders will be stored in the CDS database. All of the chain members will be accessible 
to this CDS database system. It will be linked with the developed database systems. Similarly, manufacturer 
and supplier will put any information through database this development system. By developing on line 
order placing system through developing a website will be further recommendation for apparel 
manufacturing organization and supply chain will be smoothed.

Project risk management in Iranian software projects

Abstract 
Many Software development organizations suffer chronic problems of cost overruns, schedule slips and 
projects that do not meet the originally specified functions in almost all software projects. This study 
commenced by reviewing existing risk management models. Thereafter, a survey which involved software 
project managers in Iran was conducted to gather empirical data about the practice of risk assessment. 
Thirty Software Project managers participated and were interviewed. Structured questionnaires were used 
to capture information. Observation made from this study show that in Iran, risk assessment is poorly 
practiced and many projects do not yet practice systematic risk assessment. This is because 83% of software 
project managers implicitly assess risks and the same percentage (83%) use unstructured approaches, poor 
risk identification and analysis techniques. It additionally shows that risks are not documented and 
experiences not properly utilized. This has led to ever recurring problems. The conclusion drawn indicates 
that Iran’s software project managers need to start assessing risks using proper approaches. Review of 
existing models showed that these models are complex and may not help address existing shortcomings. 
This study proposes a risk assessment framework, which helps managers to simply start assessing, 
documenting major risks, estimating risks using an objective approach that is based on frequently occurring 
risks to project likelihood of a risk occurring and subjective approach where objective approach is not 
applicable. It also supports qualitative risk estimation technique using prearranged risk estimation matrices 
and is supported by a tool which collects and stores risk data for analysis and improvement purposes.

1. Introduction
Most industries, institutions and various activities in the current century are managed using computer applications. 
However, many Software development organizations suffer chronic problems of cost overruns, schedule slips and 
projects which do not meet the originally specified functions in almost all software projects. These problems are not 
experienced only during the development of new and complex projects, but also during the enhancement of existing 
software projects. Various reasons have been put forward for the prevalence of risks in software projects. These 
include rapidly advancing computer technology (Kontio, 2001). There is always constant review of computer systems 
where new technologies replace the existing technologies which are then termed outdated and impractical for new 
development. These rapid changes have led to increased software development complexity bringing along new risks 
to the software projects. Also, the intangible nature of software means that traditional processes for managing 
industrial projects are not effective. It is also noted that of the many engineering disciplines, software engineering is 
more prone to risks than many other areas.  
In software projects, processes and requirements evolve more, complexity of products is higher, and there are a higher 
number of potential risk factors than in many other disciplines. This is partially due to the inherent nature of software 
development, in principle, all projects are more unique than those of other disciplines growing user expectations 
decrease the stability of a software project, again opening a door for potential risks. This uniqueness makes it more 
difficult to plan, model and predict the progress of a software project. Assessing risks has a cost. This cost must be 
balanced against the possible loss which can be incurred if risks are not dealt with (Wiegers, 2007). This cost include 
consumption of much time. However, the benefits thereof are immense (Selby, 2007). These benefits are; it helps in

that they used past risk experiences very often and another 43% used past risk experience often. 43% said they did not 
use past risk experience stating that projects were not similar, and differed in complexity and stakeholders needs. 
Table 1 shows problems include major risks faced by software project manager in Iran: 
Table 1. Problems faced by software project managers in Iran 
Over reliance on few skilled developers 
Delays in licenses 
Customer delays to give report samples 
Incomplete requirements 
Requirements not clear 
Users change requirements 
High staff turnover 
Frequent loss of data 
Faulty equipment (network) 
Late user involvement 
Undefined user role 
Lack of user commitment 
Unrealistic schedule estimation 
Delays in procurements 
Over spending of allocated budget 
Project team recalled in their stations 
Complex projects  
New technology 
Lack of formal project management practices 
Technical staff lack appropriate skills 
 
Changes in user requirements, often because of limited customer or user experience in development of such projects, 
unclear objectives and management changes, led to delays in projects, budget overrun and unhappy developers because 
of the wasted effort.  Schedule overrun was reported as a risk to software projects though it is not in itself a risk, but 
an outcome of undesirable events in the project. Therefore, it was clearly noted from the study that most software 
projects fail to meet schedule objective. This was mainly due to unrealistic schedule estimation, delays in acceptance 
testing, delays in procurements, change in requirements and unskilled developer. While lack of formal project 
management practices such as assessment of risks and failure to follow the project plan often led to lack of project 
control hence schedule and budget overrun, late user or customer involvement led to systems being rejected, non 
performing products and unsatisfied user. Complex projects often led to a wider learning curve hence delays in projects 
and poor design thereby production of underperforming systems. Projects become complex when the tasks to be 
automated demand much effort especially when new or leading-edge technologies are introduced. Organizations relied 
on few skilled staff. This led to schedule overrun as few staff left to work on the entire project. Coupled with lack of 
the desired infrastructure in the deployment environment or delays in procurements, this led to unhappy project team, 
unsatisfied user and delays in the project. Undefined user roles in the project limit user involvement leading to systems 
being rejected by users. While lack of experience in the programming language for developing the software led to 
underperforming system and schedule overruns, lack of commitment by users to the project led to poor communication 
and delays in acceptance testing. Finally incomplete and unclear requirements because of lack of user involvement in 
projects and customer understanding of the process which was to be automated were risks in software projects.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Most projects lacked formal risk assessment approaches and this is the major issue in software projects in Iran. This 
study reveals that, risk assessment in software projects is poorly practiced. This is because 83% of software project 
managers implicitly assess risks. At the same time, 83% use poor risk assessment approaches, which is either 
unstructured. This is mainly due to lack of awareness of formal risk assessment practices and ignorance. Even though 
some software project managers are aware of risk assessment good practices, they do not want to implement them 
because their attitude to risk assessment is very poor. They believe the process consumes much project’s valuable 
time. It was also noted that Software development organizations that are ISO certified assess risks in projects. This is 
because ISO frameworks demands for policies and development of organizations’ culture that support risk assessment 
and management. This study mentions two issues that were perceived to be major factors contributing to lack of formal 
risk assessment approaches in Iran but does not discuss them because they are not main objectives of this study. These 
include poor attitude on software projects risk assessment and organizations’ policies and culture which do not support 
the risk assessment activity. Coupled with implicit and unstructured risk assessment approaches, is lack of risk 
prioritisation, effective use of lessons learned and proper allocation of resources for mitigation, late or lack user 
participation due to poor risk assessment strategy used. The term late is used to mean that the project has reached an 
advanced stage where reversal of certain functions may impact the project, greatly. These explain why there is a 
chronic problem of schedule and budget overrun in software projects. Also majority (93%) of Iran’s software project

managers have never used risk assessment tool. 80% of the software project managers expressed the need for the 
development of this risk assessment framework and its tool to help them quickly and easily assess risks. The 
conclusion drawn from the result of risk assessment study carried out in Iran is that the existing risk assessment 
approaches tend to be inexplicit, unstructured, and undocumented. In most organizations, there is no communication 
of risks in software projects. The tools are complex as this was expressed by those who use DSS risk management 
support work tools noted that. Therefore, software project managers need to start assessing risks. This study proposes 
a risk assessment framework that supports systematic, proactive, explicit, documented and continuous risk assessment 
process through the use of experience based on frequently occurring risks. It also proposes a tool that supports the 
framework. The tool aids in the documentation of risk information by capturing identified risk information, fast 
identification of risks based a list of generic risks stored in the domain and estimation of risk likelihoods based on 
frequently occurring risks.

Abstract 
Cloud computing is an effective framework to enable on demand network access for sharing 
configurable computing resources such as applications, network, servers, services, and storages. 
Cloud technology offers the users to store and retrieve their data easily in a remote manner. 
However, privacy and security are considered as the most challenging concerns in cloud data 
storage. In this paper, a novel Privacy and Security aware Cryptographic Algorithm (PSCA) for 
data storage is proposed which is based on Invertible Non-linear Function (INF). In proposed 
technique, the encrypted data is only stored at the cloud storage without key and the encryption 
is done by the data authorities who also secure the decryption key. The end user has to send 
request to the data authority and after all verification process the encrypted data is given and with 
the obtained key and the knowledge of inverse INF the decryption is performed. Thus, both the 
internal and external attacks are avoided and its detailed analysis is given in the proposed 
security evaluation. In experimental results, the file size is plotted against encryption time, 
decryption time, uploading time, and downloading time respectively. The observed results are 
plotted and the proposed technique is compared with the existing AES and RSA techniques. 
From the results, it is observed that the proposed PSCA has better performance in terms of 
reduced time in all four parameters.

Abstract 
This paper purposes to modify multivariate control chart with multivariate spatial signs and ranks. The Monte Carlo 
simulation is used to compare the performance of the control chart based on the ARL. The modified control chart is 
sensitive to small shifts monitoring in the process mean vector and provide fast signals for detecting small shifts with 
more efficiency for symmetric t-distribution data. The results show that the SSRM outperforms MEWMA, 
dMEWMA, and SSRdM control charts in detecting small shifts of all smoothing parameter and in detecting moderate 
and large shifts outperform with the large smoothing parameter. The most industrial has current data and the industrial 
situations prefer large values of the smoothing parameter, thus the SSRM is more appropriate to kurtosis data in 
detecting small shifts for process mean monitoring and not interest in the resolution of data.

1. Introduction
Quality is generally determined by several quality characteristics which may be correlated. Each of these quality 
characteristics must satisfy certain specifications. The quality of the product depends on the combined effect of many 
input variables rather than their individual values. In monitoring situations, multivariate control charts are powerful 
tools. This method considers the correlation between variables, monitors more than one variable simultaneously and 
takes this correlation of process variables into account by the mean vector. The multivariate control charts reflect the 
process situation more precisely and are able to detect the out-of-control situation. Then it is needed for monitoring 
and diagnosis purposes in modern manufacturing systems. However, the non-normality is a factor that can reduce the 
effectiveness of the multivariate control charts (Rama-Mohana-Rao 2013). 
The main advantage of the non-parametric control charts is the flexibility derived from not needing to assume any 
parametric probability distribution for the underlying process, at least as far as establishing and implementing control 
charts are concerned. Obviously, this is very beneficial in the field of process control, particularly in the start-up 
situation where not much data is available to use a parametric procedure (Das 2008). 
This research interests in the modification of Multivariate Control Chart Using Spatial Signs and Ranks for monitoring 
process mean by applying with t-distribution in the simulation. 
2. Multivariate Spatial Signs and Ranks
Oja (2010) lets X = (x1, x2, …, xn)′,  i = 1, 2,…,n be an nxp dataset. The multivariate concepts of spatial signs, spatial 
ranks and spatial signed-rank are then given in the following. The empirical spatial signs, spatial ranks and spatial 
signed-rank functions U(x), R(x) = Rx(x), and Q(x) = Qx(x) are defined as 
        U(x) =      ||x||-1x,    x ≠ 0 
 0,    x = 0

7. Conclusions 
 
Modified Multivariate Control Chart Using Spatial Signs and Ranks for Monitoring Process Mean of symmetric             
t-distribution data is presented base on the ARL1 property. The Friedman test is used to compare the means between 
MEWMA, dMEWMA, SSRM, and SSRdM control charts and to select the highest performance of control charts. 
 
The SSRdM shows better performance at small 0.05 ≤ λ ≤ 0.2 for all p. When consider at small λ = 0.05, The SSRdM 
can detect in moderate shift (δ = 1) and some large shifts (δ = 1.5) and underperform when λ increases, λ = 0.1 can 
detect in large shifts (δ ≥ 1.5), at λ = 0.2 can detect in some large shifts (δ = 2.5) and at 0.3 ≤ λ ≤ 0.8 can detect 
underperform SSRM. The SSRdM will underperform when λ increases. It indicates that the SSRdM interest in the 
resolution of data with both historical and current. 
 
The SSRM shows better performance than others for all p. When consider at small λ= 0.05, The SSRM can detect in 
small shifts (δ ≤ 0.5) and outperform when λ increases, at λ= 0.1 can detect better in small shifts (δ ≤ 0.5) and moderate 
shift (δ = 1), at λ = 0.2  can detect better in small shifts (δ ≤ 0.5), moderate shift (δ = 1) and some large shifts (δ = 
1.5) and at 0.3 ≤ λ ≤ 0.8 can detect better in all small shifts (δ ≤ 0.5), moderate shift (δ = 1) and large shifts (δ ≥ 1.5) 
in the process mean vector. The SSRM will have a better performance when λ increases. It indicates that the SSRM 
not interest in the resolution of data. 
 
In the industrial world, the data are not a normal distribution and Baxley (1990) reported, the results for a simulated 
industrial process requiring a larger λ (λ =0.35). The results of this study show that the SSRM is superior for detecting 
small, moderate and large shifts with λ ≥ 0.3 at all of p. And the SSRM is superior for detecting small shifts (δ ≤ 0.5) 
for all λ and p, thus the SSRM is the more modern appropriate alternative for process mean monitoring in industrial. 
It is suitable to be used in the industry because most of the industry has the current data.

Multi-objective Robust Optimization for the Design of 
Biomass Co-firing Networks

Abstract 
Biomass co-firing in coal power plants is an immediate and practical approach to reduce coal usage and pollutant 
emissions because only minor modifications are required. With direct co-firing, biomass can be used directly as 
secondary fuel in power plants to partially displace coal. Although it requires minimal investments, it can lead to 
equipment corrosion from unconventional fuel properties of the biomass-coal blend. With indirect co-firing, the risk 
of damage is minimized by separately processing biomass. The solid biochar by-product can be used as soil fertilizer 
to achieve further reductions in GHG emissions through carbon sequestration. However, as this calls for a separate 
biomass energy conversion plant, its investment cost is higher. Moreover, this system faces uncertainties from the 
inherent variability in biomass quality. This must be accounted for because mixing fuels results in the blending of 
their properties. In this work, a robust optimization model is proposed to design cost and environmentally effective 
biomass co-firing networks that decides on appropriate co-firing configurations and fuel blends. A case study is solved 
to demonstrate validity. Results of Monte Carlo simulation show that the robust optimal network configuration is 
relatively immune to uncertainty realizations as compared with the optimum identified with deterministic models.

1. Introduction
The means of producing energy using fossil fuels (e.g. coal) are unsustainable. They have been tied to health and 
environmental issues, including climate change, caused by hazardous greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Ramos et al., 
2018), which can lead to disastrous environmental events. Hence, policymakers encourage minimizing the causes of 
global warming and climate change (Dundar et al. 2016), such as by using biomass as a renewable energy source, 
which is considered to be carbon neutral (U.S. EPA 2018). Co-firing biomass with coal in existing power plants is an 
immediate and practical approach to reduce coal usage and pollutant emissions with only relatively minor 
modifications (Madanayake et al. 2017). The management of biomass supply chains is challenging because of its 
seasonal and widely geographically dispersed availability and uncertain quality (Zandi Atashbar et al. 2016). 
Consequently, ensuring that a continuous supply is available will require biomass residue to be collected from several 
sources, introducing biomass quality variability into the system (Shabani and Sowlati 2013). In co-firing systems, 
feedstock composition must be considered because blending fuels results in the blending of their properties (Veijonen 
et al. 2003). Existing handling equipment are not designed to handle significantly different biomass properties. 
Biomass is typically characterized by high moisture content and low lower heating value (LHV), which can 
significantly impact conversion yield and supply chain management decisions (Pérez-Fortes et al. 2014). High 
moisture content decreases LHV or the amount of energy that may be generated from the combustion of the feedstock 
(Boundy et al. 2011). Additionally, the high alkalinity of the ash content of biomass leads to deposit formation in the 
conversion equipment, particularly slagging and fouling, which warrants the need for displacement limits. Not 
considering feedstock quality may artificially lower costs and emissions during planning, and cause the system to 
incur dramatically more costs and environmental impact to adjust their initial plans and designs. Significant financial 
losses and environmental emissions will ensue when two batches of feedstock yield considerably different amount of 
energy (Castillo-Villar et al. 2017). Moreover, biomass properties are inherently plagued with uncertainties, 
significantly influenced by external factors, such as climate, weather, and cultivation and harvesting approaches; the 
effect of these separately and their interactions are difficult to predict and measure (Ghaderi et al., 2016).

include acidification, human toxicity, and eutrophication potential. In addition, other entities involved in the network 
may be integrated, such as pretreatment and storage facilities. Pretreatment may be used to improve the quality of 
biomass before it is converted to energy in power plants. This way, the allowable co-firing limits and energy yield for 
the biomass fraction of the feedstock are increased. Keeping biomass and coal in inventory across periods can ensure 
that the proper amounts of feedstock with desirable properties are available for combustion to satisfy demand every 
period. The proposed modelling framework may be useful in selecting between available pretreatment technology 
options, and production and inventory planning. Lastly, the model may be applied to solve real-world problems.

Abstract 
Today healthcare service has offered the modern treatment approach with medical technology. This kind of 
technology has become such a predominant part of healthcare service because no practical diagnosis or treatment 
strategy is possible without using them. The advancement of technology is also driving medical companies with 
great opportunities to take a new innovative product into market. In addition, company could not focus solely on 
large amount of volume and low production cost to keep up growth, however, they have to control its direction 
towards quality trusted for usage. Meanwhile, climate change and pollution is increasingly unprecedented before 
and putting burdensome on this sector, which is lacking behind other sectors, to become sustainable manufacturing 
organization. That is true that medical device industry considers safety, usability and efficacy of product, but 
product design and development is a major role behind these factors. Sustainable design, sometimes called green 
design, has become a globally significance topic but not many works of academic papers are directly targeted to the 
medical device product. Therefore, the purpose of this study is initially conducted to identify influencing factors and 
then determine key improvement recommendation for sustainable development of medical device. Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to prioritize the influencing factors and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is 
used to find the key improvement attributes recommendation. The result of this study shows linear relationship 
between product user and developer towards quality and sustainability of product. It is found that the most of the top 
concerns of device users are not only safe for present use but also recyclability, which product can be made for 
environmental conservation, at the end of its life.

ABSTRACT 
In this article will be discussed about the implementation of control chart in cooking oil industry. Cooking oil has 
some  parameters  of quality i.e. Free Fatty Acid (FFA), Peroxide Value (PV), Iodine Value (IV), color  (Red and 
Yellow), Moisture Content, Cloud Point (CP), Cloud Stability (CS) and Freezing Point. The observed data of 
cooking oil quality parameters shows that the data is autocorrelated. Therefore, residual mapping based on 
forecasting results from the time series model is used to construct autocorrelated multivariate control chart.  In the 
multivariate T2 Hotelling control chart of the residual VAR model (2) for chemical factor has a upper control limit 
(UCL) value of 22.18 and a median of 3.60. The T2 Hotelling control chart of the residual VAR model (2) for 
physical factors has a control upper control limit  (UCL)  of 21.59 and a median value of 3.63. 
Keywords 
 quality control, multivariate control chart, autocorrelated. 
1. Introduction
Quality becomes the main factor of consumer decisions to get a product, consumers tend to buy a product 
from a company which is considered more qualified than its competitors. There are several ways to improve product 
quality, one of them is to apply statistical process control (SPC). Shewhart (1931) developed statistical process 
control (SPC) techniques for the improvement and assurance of product and service quality. Statistical process 
control (SPC) is a methodology used for monitoring and reducing the variation in manufacturing processes and the 
main tools of SPC are control charts. Normally, SPC works under the assumption that observed data is independent. 
However, the advanced measurement technology, shortened sampling interval and the nature of processes, 
especially in continuous processes, e.g., chemical processes, the independence of each observation has been violated 
in many scenarios. The lack of independence among each sample usually comes in the form of serial autocorrelation 
(Kandananond, 2014). There are many situations in which the simultaneous monitoring or control of two or more 
related quality characteristics is necessary. Lu and Reynolds (1999) and Jarrett and Pan, (2007) studied quality 
control chart for monitoring multivariate autocorrelated control chart. Monitoring two or more quality characteristics 
independently can be very misleading. Process-monitoring problems in which several related variables are of 
interest are sometimes called multivariate quality-control (or process-monitoring) problems. The original work in 
multivariate quality control was done by Hotelling (1947) (Montgomery, 2009). 
Cooking oil has some  parameters  of quality i.e. Free Fatty Acid (FFA), Peroxide Value (PV), Iodine 
Value (IV), color  (Red and Yellow), Moisture Content, Cloud Point (CP), Cloud Stability (CS) and Freezing Pointt.  
Free Fatty Acid (FFA) is a parameter to determine free fatty acid content in a sample. In FFA analysis, 
Phenolphthalein  (PP) indicator is used. FFA value in pure CPO is below 3%. Peroxide Value (PV) is a parameter to 
know the oxidation rate of oil. PV is calculated as millilitre of Sodium Tiosulfate which is used to bind free Iodine 
in every gram of oil. The greater the PV, the more oxidation occurs in the oil. The size of the PV will affect the 
quality of oil. Iodine Value (IV) is a parameter for measuring clarity in cooking oil. Cooking oil clarity is indicated 
by the number of double bonds contained. Color is a visual analysis used to measure the color of fats and oils using 
the Lovibond Tintometer. Cloud Point (CP) is a parameter used to find out the temperature when the oil is cloudy or 
obfuscated.

Figure 4 shows the residual multivariate control chart of physical factors that have been in full in control condition 
with a 21.59 Upper Control Limit (UCL) limit and a median value of 3.63. 
 
8.  Conclusion and Suggestions 
Some of the quality parameters used in this study are FFA, IV, PV, color red, yellow color, CP. From the results 
of research conducted, it is known that the quality parameters of cooking oil are correlated and autocorrelated each 
other. Therefore, the appropriate control chart to be used is the T2 Hotelling multivariate control chart of the residual 
time series model. Factor analysis is conducted to form quality parameters into two factors, namely physical factors 
and chemical factor. Physical factors consist of parameter FFA, color red, color yellowr. Chemical factor consist of 
parameter IV, PV, and CP. From the formation of time series model for physical factors and chemical factors it is 
known that the model corresponding to each factor is VAR (2) model. T2 Hotelling multivariate control chart from 
residual model VAR (2) for chemical factor has upper control limit (UCL) of 22,18 and median value 3,60. The T2 
Hotelling control chart of the residual VAR model (2) for physical factors has a control upper limit (UCL) of 21.59 
and a median value of 3.63. T2 Hotelling multivariate control chart from the residual VAR model to control the 
quality of cooking oil with correlated and autocorrelated quality parameters.

Abstract 
Strategies of financial institutions on cash replenishment and maintenance for a network of automated teller machines 
should be treated as a whole instead of independent of one another. Cash replenishment is a type of maintenance and 
having separate service providers conduct this type of maintenance adds costs and liabilities to the financial 
institutions. The optimal strategy to be employed focuses on the reduction of cash-related expenses, while maintaining 
the appropriate banknote-levels in each ATM; minimizing cash-dry instances on individual teller machines. With the 
increasing concern of financial institutions for customer satisfaction, the optimal strategy will also consider the amount 
of maintenance to be conducted for each ATM; minimizing downtime on individual teller machines. Factors such as 
daily service capacity, replenishment need, maintenance need, available time, travel time and service time are to be 
considered. The proposed model is able to solve situations where multiple machines are expected to breakdown on a 
certain day, as well as single replenishments spread throughout different days. Furthermore, the dynamic element of 
the scheduling problem enables the model to consider changes after new forecasts or behavior for replenishment or 
maintenance have been made for different teller machines, after the service schedule that had been initially made.

1. Introduction
Retail financial services have continuously evolved at a great pace in the recent past. In this changing global financial 
services market, the role of a retail bank has continuously been redefined, specifically with respect to the provision of 
cash to a global society. Despite proposed movements to move into a cashless world, customers have continued to 
prefer cash as the method of payment in concluding their transactions (Adendorff and Kruger 2012). Given the 
situation, cash logistics or cash replenishment in automated teller machines (ATMs) has been a key operation that all 
retail banks have to deal with. 
Cash logistics can be viewed as a supply chain with only one product involved: cash. The system deals with 
several factors and conditions; and financial institutions need to continuously adjust and operate under these 
constraints (Kurdel and Sebestyenova 2012). The resources that banks primarily use in cash logistics are the amounts 
of cash that are stored in ATMs, and the transportation teams that transfer cash through an ATM network. ATMs are 
usually stocked up with one up to four different types of banknotes or denominations, which are stored in containers 
called cassettes (Anholt and Vis 2012). ATMs allow customers to perform banking transactions such as withdrawing 
from one’s account, conducting balance inquiries, transferring funds from one account to another, and conducting bill 
payments (Danlami and Mayowa 2014). The factors and conditions that banks operate under, on the other hand, are 
customer demand, calendar schedules, and machine breakdowns. Failure to determine a proper schedule for the 
replenishment of ATMs will lead to more costs that banks incur. 
While amounts of cash being stored in ATMs contribute significantly to the cash logistics operations of a 
bank, financial institutions also need to consider ATM maintenance schedules; as the same amount of costs are used 
to transfer transportation teams from one machine to another. Considering cash replenishment as well as ATM

Following the resulting Full Maintenance Schedule, Figure 2 displays the status of each machine. The start 
column represents the forecasted behavior of the machine (1 for working and 0 for breakdown) and the end column 
represents the behavior of the machine after the service operations based on the formulated schedule. It can be 
observed that six out of seven days have 100% availability of machines, resulting from the practice of a a proactive 
maintenance schedule instead of a reactive one. The 75% availability on the first day, may be due to the dependency 
of the model to multiple days. Since it is the first day in the model and is not linked to any previous days, it serves as 
a warm up point for the proactive maintenance cycle. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
A scheduling model for the full maintenance of automated teller machines considering a proactive approach was 
developed and proposed in this study. The model proposed considered assumptions for constraints regarding the 
operating hours of armored vehicles, proactive service, service warranty, and replenishment. The model considers full 
maintenance, which considers both service maintenance and ATM replenishment as it is essential for financial 
institutions to conduct their automated teller machine operations with regard to both of these aspects. 
This study conducted a case study approach validation process that considered a number of ATMs being serviced 
by one armored vehicle through a fixed time period of one week. Considering different constraints, the model was 
able to determine a full maintenance schedule that indicates which ATMs to be serviced on different days. 
Moving forward, factors such as the number of armored vehicles able to service the network of ATMs should be 
considered. Second, different routes from one ATM location to another ATM location will play a factor in the 
scheduling model. Considering traffic will affect the travel times of the armored vehicles, and therefore, will affect 
the amount of time left to service each machine. Furthermore, appropriate distribution functions should also be used 
for the determination of ATM service time, as well as decrease of ATM cash levels. 
The following recommendations will be able to predict a more accurate behavior of the teller machines, and 
therefore, may also lead to a more accurate scheduling model for the full maintenance of automated teller machines.

Abstract 
It is estimated that around 1.3 billion people globally still have either limited or no access at all to electricity. These, 
in turn, have directed greater focus on affordable, accessible, and environmental-friendly renewable energy systems. 
In countries like the Philippines with numerous unelectrified remote communities, there is even greater need to 
incorporate affordable renewable energy technologies because the cost of investing in national grid extensions proves 
to be very costly. Micro hydroelectric power is a clean and efficient source of energy that has been used for the 
electrification of rural off-grid communities around the world. In this paper, an optimization model for the design of 
an off grid micro hydro power plant is developed. The proposed model is able to provide the necessary technical 
specifications given certain parameters such as details on the site location and requirements of the small rural 
community. Additionally, the model is also able to provide the minimum cost needed to invest in the micro hydro 
power plant. Finally, the model is then compared with current cost equations to see how the model compares with 
current studies.

1. Introduction
Electricity is a good that is essential for the promotion of education, health, transportation, and infrastructure
which in turn, improves the standards of living of a community (Nasir 2014). However, the world is currently faced 
with diminishing sources of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. Furthermore, accessibility to electricity 
continues to be a problem around the world, particularly in developing countries. It is estimated that around 1.3 billion 
people globally still have either limited or no access at all to electricity (The outlook for energy: A view to 2040 2014). 
These, in turn, have directed greater focus on affordable, accessible, and environmentally-friendly renewable energy 
systems. In countries like the Philippines with numerous unelectrified remote communities, there is even greater need 
to incorporate affordable renewable energy technologies because the cost of investing in national grid extensions 
proves to be very costly (Roxas and Santiago 2016). According to the Philippine Institute for Development Studies 
(2013), about 16 million Filipinos still do not have access to electricity and such problem persists in nearby countries 
like Indonesia (63 million) and in Myanmar (26 million).  
Micro hydro is a well-established technology that has been implemented for rural electrification around the world. 
It a run-of-river system, which means it does not require a dam or a storage facility to be constructed. It diverts water 
from a stream or river, channels it into a valley and then it drops into a turbine through a pipeline (Bracken et. al 2014).  
It can provide clean affordable renewable energy to remote communities and can be operated without a connection to 
the grid. The comparative advantages of micro hydro include the following: relatively lower cost of maintenance and 
operations, can be locally managed and operated,  and it has minimal environmental effects. The characteristics for 
potential sites conducive for micro hydro implementation include the following: situated close to a running body of 
water, has enough demand for electricity, and isolated from the grid (Centre for Rural Technology, Nepal 2005).

4.2 Base Run Results 
 
The base run resulted to choosing the optimal component choices based on the target efficiency and required 
demand of the community. Seen below is the table of the component choices with a resulting total cost of Php 799,000. 
It was also able to meet the target efficiency with a system efficiency of 0.53.

On the other hand, the optimal site characteristic is determined as the one with a head of 16.5 meters and a flow 
rate of 1 m3/s. To further validate the results, a comparison with the cost estimate equation of 𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝($/𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘) =
566.9𝐻𝐻0.01218𝑃𝑃0.1452 formulated by Zhang et. al (2012) is used. The total cost of the model together with the input data 
derived from actual data sites resulted to around  Php 799k. Dividing this by the community demand and converting 
it to dollar would yield to a unit cost of $1,183.70/kW. Compared to the total cost coming from the equation, the model 
was able to determine a savings of Php 212.4k. 
 
 
5.. Conclusions 
 
A model was developed through MATLAB that was able to determine the optimal micro hydro power plant 
components to be chosen with the least cost, given a community’s energy demand and the site conditions. This model 
can be useful as a rapid assessment tool for micro hydro power plant planning 
 
The existing model can be improved by analyzing more technical components of the micro hydro power plant 
such as penstock thickness, penstock diameter, specific speed, and rotation speed. Furthermore, incorporating 
productive end usage as another demand stream can improve the model as it can show the possible profitability of a 
micro hydro power plant investment.

Abstract 
Applications of electronic map from mobile phone have helped drivers finding travel destinations. These 
applications were often used by driver as guidance when he was driving. There were some factors caused traffic 
accident that endanger individuals. Among these factors, human error was the main factor that caused traffic 
accidents. This research aims analyzing the effect of using electronic maps while driving on human error 
probability. This research used goggle map application as secondary task on driver. Human Error Assessment and 
Reduction Technique (HEART) were used to analyze human error probability and its output be compared to drivers 
shelves report. The reports include incident and accident that have been experienced by drivers along driving while 
using electronic map. The value of human error probability on this condition was 0.0106 and according to driver 
subjective judgment, the drivers never had experienced on incidents and accidents. However sometime a driver got a 
warning from another driver because he inhibited the traffics. A procedure driving safely while using electronic map 
was designed to minimize accident and protest from others driver. This research concluded this driving activity 
increased human error probability very slight and it will safe if driver allow the procedure.

1. Background
Using electronic maps via mobile phone helps drivers in finding travel destinations. These applications were often 
used by drivers as guidance while driving. Driving a vehicle is a complex task that requires not only physical skills 
for controlling the direction and speed of a vehicle but also mental skills for sustained monitoring of integrated 
perceptual and cognitive inputs that allow a driver to make time-appropriate decisions. Response time of driver was 
significantly slower if driving task was accompanied by a concurrent auditory task like operating mobile phone 
(Christian, Richard and Steven, 2002). 
Based on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2004, there were three factors caused traffic accident 
that endanger individuals. First factor was human (human  error), second factor was the vehicle (machine error), and 
third factor was the way (manufactured error). Among these three factors, human error was the main factor that 
caused traffic accidents. Human error is an action, a decision which is not necessary/not right which can reduce or 
potentially reduce effectiveness, safety, and performance of a system. The human error problem can be viewed in 
two ways: the person approach and the system approach. The person approach h focuses on the unsafe acts—errors 
and procedural violations—of people. This unsafe acts as arising primarily from aberrant mental processes such as 
forgetfulness, inattention, poor motivation, carelessness, negligence, and recklessness. The system approach is that 
humans are fallible and errors are to be expected, even in the best organizations. Errors are seen as consequences 
rather than causes (Reason, 2000). 
At micro-level of transport system, the driving system is composed of the users, the transport tools and the 
infrastructures used for the journeys. These components operate by interacting with one another and the smooth 
running of the system implies that all three components have been adjusted correctly.  Most safety studies have been 
based upon a person approach and stress the role of human error in the production of 75 to 90 per cent of accidents.

3. Find some place or building that appeared on the map before get your destination. 
4. Don’t forget turn on indicators when turning or changing lanes. 
5. Be aware your surroundings 
6. One km before turning sure you have been on the right lane.   
7. One km before your destination sure you have been in edge line according the position of your destination. 
8. Observe your speed, One km before your destination drive slowly.  
 
This procedure was a detail operation procedure for driving safety while using electronic map. Some global strategy 
how to low risk of mobile phone use while driving have formulated by (Oviedo-trespalacios et al., 2017), include: 
(i) re-engineer mobile phone tasks to avoid sub-tasks that require visual demands  project information onto the 
vehicle windscreen in line with the driver's forward line of sight), (ii) restructure enforcement strategies to overcome 
behavioural adaptations such as keeping the mobile phone low and searching for police (e.g. technologies to support 
automated enforcement through the detection of radio frequencies), and (iii) educational campaigns could be 
designed to prevent visual interfaces while driving. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Probability of human errors that cause accidents or Human Error Probability (HEP) on the drivers using electronic 
map while driving is very small, just 1.06%. The drivers have not experiencing on the condition almost wretched or 
accidents while driving using an electronic map. But for the other drivers, using the electronic map can impede their 
vehicles and gave wretched conditions. A standar procedure was designed to keep activity of using electronic map 
as secondary driving task didn’t impede the traffic.

Abstract 
 
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is defined as a problem where a salesman must visit all cities 
where each city is only visited once, and must start from and return to the origin city. The goal of 
solving this problem is to determine the route with minimum total distance or cost. TSP was first 
formulated in 1930 and it is one of the most intensively studied problems in optimization. 
Variants and various application of TSP have been developed and solved to accomodate 
industrial problems. TSP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It means TSP can 
be solved in polynomial time. Exact methods are hard to solve big size TSP problem. The 
process of the exact method needs longer computational time to solve the problem. The 
limitation of exact method in dealing with complex TSP only can be solved by metaheuristics. 
Some metaheuristics in some researches were used to solved TSP in order to achieve optimum 
solution. This research article proposes new metaheuristic method to solve TSP. This method is 
called Partial Comparison Optimization (PCO). PCO is powerful metaheuristic to solve 
combinatorial problems such as TSP. In this research PCO gave better optimum solution 
compared with other metaheuristics for solving TSP.

Abstract 
Statistical Process Control (SPC) is an important tool to solve problems associated in businesses or companies and 
the most effective way in obtaining process durability and decreasing the variability. In business system, products or 
service do not always meet the desired range of quality or performance with the customer specification. This occurs 
due to several sources of variation such as machines, operators, materials etc. The main purpose of control chart is to 
monitor these variations and control the process. In applying SPC methods, this study deals with the control and 
improvement of the quality of calls in a Contact Center company by inspecting their three consecutive months’ 
performance. From the inspection, the researchers developed X bar chart and Range (R) control chart from using the 
necessary data. Through proper investigation, the process will be identified where it is in control or not. For the 
process of out of control, reasons should be identified and take corrective actions. 
Keywords: Statistical Process Control, Mean, Range, Upper Control Limit, Lower Control Limit. 
1. Introduction
A control chart is a graph used to study how a process changes over time. It was proposed in the 1920s by Walter A. 
Shewhart of the Bell Telephone Laboratories. There are two types of control charts: control chart for variables and 
control char for attributes. The following charts are commonly constructed controlling variables: X-bar (mean) 
chart, R (range) chart and S (standard deviation) chart. The chart contains a center line which is represented by the 
average value of the quality characteristic corresponding to the in-control state. It has two control limits namely; 
Upper Control Limit (UCL) and Lower Control Limit (LCL) that is also represented by a line. By comparing the 
current data to these lines, a conclusion can be made whether the process variation is consistent (in-control) when 
the sample points fall between them or if it is unpredictable (out of control) due to the causes of variation. It can be 
seen when some points go beyond the control limit line. A Contact Center company began operations in the 
Philippines in 1996 and has grown to become a preferred offshore contact center outsourcing option. The company 
employs around 40,000 people in the country and operates nearly 30,000 workstations in 20 business sites located 
across Metro Manila, Antipolo, Baguio, Bacolod, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro and Davao.

5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, the control chart is incorporated in assessing the performance of a Contact Center company. Using the 
quality control chart, a set of activities is achieved like measuring the sources of variation and understanding the 
process. This will be helpful in continuing to improve the employee’s quality of service to their customers. In this 
study, the researchers conclude that the given data is in control since there are no points that exceed the upper and 
lower control limit. This shows that the new employees in the Contact Center company have a delivered a good 
performance in the quality of their work for the given months.

Abstract 
The study was conducted at a manufacturing company where plastic products are produced. This study aims to find 
out the possible root cause of rejects in a specific product produce at Plastic Department. In this way, implementing 
statistical approach on determining the possible cause of rejects and also set standards on how to lessen it that can 
affect the daily production of the said product. It also gives the idea to the management on how to save cost 
efficiently by reducing the amount of rejects and determine proper measures to be set according to the result. The 
charts were very helpful on determining what points are out-of-control and how the process to be changed. This 
study uses Control Charts for Attributes, to identify the out of control points. The Minitab software application is 
used as a tool to identify the graph which we can examine the out of control points in the process. This study uses 
observations and quantitative approach to find what is the root cause of tremendous reject made.  
Keywords: Control charts for attributes, Minitab 
Background of the Study 
A lot of reject were observed produced by the machine in Plastic Department of Marilao Alerco Industrial 
Corporation. Also, that more rejects were observed that are produced than the good ones. So, it come up with a 
study to make a quality control on the product and make necessary adjustments by using statistical quality control 
measurements. The production of utility boxes is chosen because it is one of the greatest number of rejects came 
from and management said that the ¼ of production of plastic department is coming from utility box.

Figure 3 shows the less variation occur on control chart after corrective actions were taken. The timing of injection 
machine was diagnosed and the authors of the study requested to change and adjust the mold. There was less 
variation encountered as a result of the authors’ recommendation. Plant manager said that there would be less rejects 
if the mold were changed and the time to produce the product is at high possible. The company is delighted and 
amazed how much reject they produce than the good one. The corrective actions given are good because the control 
chart shows less variation of low quality happen.

From these tables, the variation happen were observed on the upper and lower control limit also the central limit it is 
because the reject is become low when the corrective actions taken. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In using statistical process control, the massive effect of high rejection rate was observed occurring in the company. 
It provides so much information on how to addressed the current problem of the company, especially on how to 
control it. The SPC has proved high effectiveness in centering the processes and producing high quality products. As 
a result, the authors came up with an action and submitted it to the top management. Rejection rate is lessened as a 
result of the proposed action. The authors advised to management that, implement quality control on all the 
machines because it could contribute to low efficiency caused by high rejection rate.

Abstract 
Process Industry is rapidly growing in Bangladesh. Lean six sigma (LSS), a process improvement tool, can be 
applied to this sector for efficient operational performance. Since there have been manifold factors which influence 
and induce the process performance while implementing LSS, prevailing drivers have been sorted out from the 
survey on the managers of analogous companies. In the proposed framework, Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) 
has been applied to check the contextual relationship among the selected drivers and MICMAC analysis has been 
implemented to categorize the drivers according to their influence on company’s performance based on the driving 
power and dependence on each other. The proposed model integrates ISM and MICMAC Analysis to sort the 
drivers from least to greatest influence it has on process performance. The focus of this paper is to aid the 
practitioners in prioritizing the drivers while implementing LSS in the process industry. 
Keywords: 
Lean Six Sigma, Drivers, Impeding factors, Limitations, Motivation factors 
1. Introduction
A process industry is defined as where production process follows either a continuous system or batch production 
system to convert bulk resources to other products. In the case of batch production system, the batch material is 
identical. These types of industries generally produce high volume, low variety and inflexible products. It occurs due 
to the longer setup time than other industrial system (Abdulmalek, Rajgopal, & Needy, 2006). To give 
exemplification of process industry, it can be said that chemicals, food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, 
textiles, ceramics, base metals, plastics, refined oil, gasoline, wooden and plastics product are produced in 
these industries. 
To improve the process in efficient way, various methods are being followed. Among them Lean manufacturing 
system and six sigma has gained significant popularity. Lean manufacturing system assigns value to the raw material 
even though it reduces waste. On the other hand, six sigma drastically decreases the nonconformities of products 
through effective problem solving methods. But, in the recent years, shorter product life cycle demands shorter time 
to market which can be met by excellent implementation of lean six sigma. Implementation of these two methods is 
making the process a lot easier to complete than conventional process. In lean six sigma process, problem 
identification and process improvement is faster and more efficient because lean speeds up six sigma process 
(Cherrafi, Elfezazi, Chiarini, Mokhlis, & Benhida, 2016). It prioritizes defect prevention over defect detection to 
ensure customer satisfaction by reducing nonconformities, waste, and cycle time through developing work standard 
and balanced flow.

The purpose of MICMAC analysis is further analysis of the drivers of LSS. It is done by putting dependence and 
driver power in X and Y axis respectively. Here cluster I represents “autonomous driver”. Among 20 driver, 12 
drivers have been found in this cluster. These selected autonomous factor for LSS are: ED1, ED3, ED6, ED7, ED8, 
ED10, ED12, ED14, ED15, ED17, ED18 and ED20. Cluster II represents “dependent driver”. Manager should take 
special care of these drivers for successful implementation. Four drivers have been found as dependent factors. 
These are ED2, ED9, ED13 and ED19. Cluster III represents “linkage driver” which is highly unstable. Any action 
on this factor can imply effects on others, also there will be feedback on themselves. Among our selected drivers 
none has showed this unstable nature. Lastly, cluster IV represents “independent driver”. This factor is called key 
factor as it plays vital role for the implementation of the system. Here we have found ED4, ED5, ED11, and ED16 
as independent factors. 
6. Result & Discussion 
To fully understand the importance of the drivers of LSS is essential for the proper implementation of LSS in the 
process industry. From the ISM diagraph we have found that among our selected 20 drivers, availability of skilled 
workers (ED11) was found playing the vital role. It is one the key factor in LSS system having higher driver power. 
So it is placed in the bottom of hierarchy. Other key factors such as following standard operating procedures (ED5) 
and employee training (ED16) are in the lower part of hierarchy having higher level in ISM as well as they have 
higher driver power. Besides, some drivers have strong links to the system though they have lower driver power. 
These are: no frequent changes in supply schedule by customers (ED3), stable customer order (ED7), low variety of 
product (ED8) and govt. legislation (ED20). Global competition (ED13) driver positioned in level 1 in ISM 
hierarchy needs least attention for the LSS system. In level 2, Cost savings (ED19) is placed. Reducing lead time 
(ED2) is placed in level 3 along with less machine breakdowns (ED17). Highly responsive suppliers (ED1), low 
labor cost (ED10) and strong workplace organization and housekeeping (ED12) are in level 4. In level 5, there are 
low scrap/ rework / rejection (ED9), customer wants reliable and prompt deliveries (ED15) and organization culture 
(ED18) drivers. Strong process control (ED6) and Advances in manufacturing & information technology (ED14) are 
in level 6. Employee training (ED16) and Govt. legislation (ED20) are in level 7. These drivers have impact in the 
framework and need special care. Then, low variety of product (ED8) in the next level. Good quality material or 
parts supplied by suppliers (ED4) and stable customer order (ED7) are in level 8. No frequent changes in supply 
schedule by customers (ED3) and Following standard operating procedures (ED5) are in next level. Availability of 
skilled workers (ED11) is in the highest level 11 which has great impact on the framework.  
7. Conclusion  
Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) helps us to develop a systematic and directional structure for a complex 
system along with a practical picture of the system. It indicates the direct and indirect association among the critical 
drivers of implementing LSS in process industries. It also provides different levels of the potent drivers. With the 
help of these levels of the drivers, a structural framework is developed. With the help of these framework and 
knowledge of different levels of different drivers, a decision maker can easily co-ordinate among these drivers 
which will accelerate the process of implementing LSS in process industries. MICMAC analysis provides four 
different cluster through drive power and dependence power. From this ISM method and MICMAC analysis we find 
the critical drivers and co-relation among them which will accelerate the process of implementing LSS in process 
industries.

Abstract 
Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) refers to the concept of integrating and incorporating green concepts 
and eco-friendly thinking to traditional Supply Chain management Initiatives (GSCI) which include processes 
such as products design, materials sourcing and selection, manufacturing and production management. This 
research work is an approach at strategic level to evolve Green Supply Chains practice for New Kuwait, the State 
of Kuwait’s national development plan towards a prosperous and sustainable future. Grounded on the Institutional 
Theory and the Natural Resource Based View (NRBV), a framework is developed to act as a decision making 
tool for top management in prioritizing and implementing selected green strategies. This study investigates how 
Company XYZ for Metals and Recycling, ISO 14001 certified, prioritizes its green strategies and where its GSCIs 
are implemented. For different green strategies, the outcomes of the Analytical Network Process (ANP), 
Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) clearly showed Company XYZ 
the different prioritizations and which to enforce such as; pollution prevention, product stewardship and clean 
technology through green initiatives. Using our developed decision-making framework, product stewardship was 
the most significant strategy to adopt for Company XYZ in order to become green, gain a competitive advantage, 
and achieve cost reduction it thrives for.

1. Introduction
The production of a physical goods consists of several stages such as: raw material, manufactures, transportation, 
retailers, and customers. These stages forms a supply chain network that contributes to delivering products to the 
customers (Chopra and Meindl, 2016). The role of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is central in any business 
vision. SCM is the building block to have an overall success; connecting and integrating all the firms, employees, 
and distributers in the network and focusing on upgrading the outcomes as shown in Figure 1.

As a result of the final list of priorities; findings are: 
 To gain the CA in terms of cost reduction company XYZ should start focusing on the Product stewardship 
(48%), and pollution prevention (27%), then clean technology (25%) based on their weights. 
 The adoption of green strategies (GS) should start with greening post-use for having the highest importance 
0.335 in the ANP Model. 
If the company made these kinds of modifications, company XYZ will eventually gain the CV they are eager to 
achieve. Not to mention the reputation and legitimacy that every business manager is dreaming of once having.  
 
7. Conclusion and research implications  
 
 
To conclude, after reviewing the two main theories, which are the Natural Resource Based View theory, 
and the institutional theory, that represent the external and internal drivers affecting the implementation of GS in 
the supply chain, we were able to build our conceptual model and designing our decision-making tool. By identify 
the conceptual model for developing the green supply chain, which analyzes the importance and the performance 
of GSC initiatives. As the word importance refer to the significance of the green practices depending on the 
company’s priorities for accepting and adopting green strategies. And the word performance measures the current 
level of the company’s environmental improvement. The thought is devoted to make a relationship between 
empirical study and the approach of measurable decision-making tool by using statistical tools such as Analytic 
Network Process (ANP), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). To 
improve and develop the strategic changes that needed to be considered by manufacturing companies to become 
green during this project. Through an approach to develop green supply chain to the New Kuwait in order to 
achieve the goal of the Kuwait National Development Plan of creating an environmental awareness in society that 
contributes to the pillar of living environmental. New Kuwait plan aims to transform Kuwait to be cultural and 
economic hub. As the outcome in Figure (9) this study found that prioritization of green strategies for XYZ 
Company should focus on product stewardship with the weight of 48% and then pollution prevention with the 
weight of 27%. These strategies should be implemented in their supply chain starting with 35% greening post use 
then 27% for the greening upstream to gain their competitive advantage in term of cost reduction.

Abstract  
 
5S is lean tool which involves workplace organization and is implemented to reduce the searching time of a product.  
The methodology adopted in this paper is the 5S pillar approach: Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, Shitsuke to increase 
the overall efficiency of the process. The result of implementation of each step of the 5S methodology at XYZ 
Limited is also shown in this paper. The 5S methodology is applied to solve the problems in inspection department 
of the forging industry producing several crankshafts with the aim to eliminate losses in the company. The existing 
problem of company is dealt with is messy tool setting, bad working environment and inefficient process flow. The 
company cannot meet customer's demand and works inefficiently, because everyone in the company is not used to a 
clean working environment and all inventory interrupts the process flow; therefore the major objective of this study 
is to help company not only to rearrange but also reset the working environment and enhance the process flow by 
using 5S tools. After implementing of 5S in the inspection department the time saving is 39.60% and also certain 
process wastes are reduced.  The inspection department in the workplace became neat and effective. 
 
Keywords  
5S, Crankshafts, Efficiency, Inspection  
 
1. Introduction  
The main objective of this research is the application of 5S tools in the inspection of crank shaft. Lean is 
defined as systematic elimination of wastes and lean thinking principles are :  Defining value of the products, 
Identifying value and non value added activities, Eliminate non value added activities and make the value 
creating steps flow, Let the customers pull, pursue perfection. Most commonly used Lean tools are Value 
Stream Mapping, 5S, Set up reduction, Kanban, Heijunka, Visual controls and kanban. Many company that 
undergo lean transformation starts with 5S tools as it is a basic technique that exposes hidden problems in the 
form of waste which can be minimized and other lean tools can successively be implemented. 5S stands for 
Seiri(Sort), Seiton(Set in order), Seiso(Shine), Seiketsu(Standardize) and Shitsuke(Sustain). 5S enables one to 
comprehend the status of production area by simple observation without the use of computers. The 5S 
philosophy focuses on simplification of the work environment, effective workplace organization, and reduction 
of waste while improving safety, efficiency and productivity. The 5S technique is a structured program to 
systematically achieve total organization cleanliness and standardization. 
 
 
2. Literature Review 
Shahryar Sorooshian et al.(2012) implemented 5S philosophy to achieve a designated location for each item[1]. 
Harsha Lingareddy et al (2013) carried out inspection process based on 5S checklists in order to improve the 
efficiency in production [2].  Khedkar et al (2012) implemented 5S techniques in plastic moulding industry to 
enhance safety, productivity and efficiency [3]. J. Michalska et al. (2007) proposed 5S rules and implemented 
these rules in production process. The training of the workers in this 5S rules in order to achieve continuous 
improvement [4]. Gheorghe Dulhai (2008) proposed a process based continuous improvement strategy to 
improve manufacturing at auto car exhaust. The “5S” rules, is implemented at the middle and bottom levels of 
the organization which is coordinated and helped by the superior management [5]. Soumya et al (2015) 
contributed step by step implementation guideline for successfully practising 5S as a part of daily practice. 
Also a method is adopted using the 5S pillar approach to improve the overall performance [6]. Agrahari et al 
(2015) implemented 5S methodology in a small scale industry to achieve housekeeping and productivity. A 
case study was presented using 5S methodology and questions were asked to   workers and their feedback was 
implemented to increase the storing place [7]. Saad Shaikh et al (2015) implemented 5S methodology in small

6.Conclusion 
After the successful implementation of 5S methodology the time taken for the inspection of crankshaft is reduced to 
71 seconds from 101 seconds for staff1, 73 seconds from 103 seconds for staff 2, 76 seconds from 106 seconds for 
staff3, 69 seconds from 98 seconds for staff4,  76 seconds from 96 seconds for staff5. Due to implementation of 5S, 
abnormalities were highlighted, problems were observed visually and hence action plan were taken to be solved.  
The number of accidents happened in the industry were reduced. There was improvement in time utilization. 
However the 5S implementation tools can be applied to the entire manufacturing process of crank shaft and not 
limited to inspection process alone. The future work will involve the application of 5S tools in service sector and 
lean office concept may be applied.

Abstract 
The quality of products in the industry can be improved by monitoring the manufacturing process and 
adjusting/optimizing the process input variables based on the output deviation from the target. EPC stands for 
Engineering Process Control, and it is concerned with adjusting systems inputs to keep the system output on target 
using different types of controllers such as Integral Controllers and PID controllers. SPC stands for Statistical 
Process Control and is used to monitor processes in order to identify any assignable causes of variation. 
Combining EPC and SPC as a unified framework proved to be effective in reducing production disruption in 
manufacturing industries. The main aim of this project is to redesign the production and quality control system in 
XYZ Chemical Company by developing an Engineering Process Controller in order to adjust the chemical process 
inputs to keep the output chemical concentration on best optimized target while monitoring the system using the 
sensitive Time Weighted Control chart to identify and eliminate the process assignable causes of variation, 
improve system elements life, and reduce overall system wide costs.

1. Introduction
Engineering process control (EPC) & Statistical process control (SPC) are two very different approaches 
to improve the process efficiency by reducing the process disturbances or variability and achieving a much better 
product quality which will lead to customer satisfaction and increase in sales (Mastrangelo, 1998). SPC works by 
monitoring the process by utilizing different types of control charts and tries to identify any points located outside 
the control limits (Montgomery, 2013) (Page, 1954). Points located outside the control limits are commonly 
referred as assignable causes which means there’s a specific cause that caused the point to be out of the control 
limits (Roberts , 1959). It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between common cause and assignable cause, 
furthermore just because the points are within the control limits does not mean the process is under control 
(Bernard , 1959). The points sometimes generate a suspicious pattern which will indicate there’s something wrong 
in the process and must be fixed. Now for the EPC it’s a continuous process of manipulating the process input 
controls in order to keep the output on target (Ogata, 2010). EPC utilizes different types of controllers that work 
by feedback adjustment such as the integral controller and the PID controller (Ogata, 2010) (Montgomery, 2013). 
These controllers will work in conjunction with a certain type of control chart where if a point falls outside the 
control limits then it will automatically trigger the controller to take corrective actions to bring the process back 
in control. The SPC & EPC unified framework has been proven to be very effective at significantly reducing the 
process variation and drastically improving the product quality. According to Karim Al Jebory & Mohammed Al 
Shebeb (Aljebory & Mohammed Al shebeb, 2014) they implemented the SPC & EPC unified framework in a 
chlorine manufacturing company and they managed to reduce the process variation by 30%. The findings of the 
case study (Aljebory & Mohammed Al shebeb, 2014) has shown us how effective it is to combine both techniques 
and that is why it is called SPC & EPC unified framework. As we previously mentioned there are many types of 
Shawhart control charts, however there are two types of control charts that are very good at detecting small shifts

7. Conclusion 
 
 
 
In conclusion, the development and application of SPC & EPC unified framework has been proven to be 
very effective in reducing process variation and improving the product quality. EWMA control charts are very 
effective at detecting small shifts in the process means thanks to its sensitivity and is also able to forecast the next 
process error which is essential in control engineering. In this project the objective was to create a concept where 
we used the EWMA control chart in conjunction with the integral controller in order to keep the feed brine 
concentration on target in order to increase the cell membranes life cycle. SPC & EPC integration approach was 
done in three phases; offline monitoring phase, online measuring and detecting phase and finally the integrated 
SPC/EPC phase. The first phase was about analyzing the process, identifying the CTQ, identifying the key input 
variables and understating the process flow chart. The second phase involves analyzing the current control system. 
The third and final phase is where we introduce the concept which is the EWMA control chart in conjunction with 
the integral controller. After consulting with the process control engineers, they said by keeping the feed brine 
concentration on target we are able to double cell membrane lifecycle, reduce monthly cost by 50% and reduce 
process variation. As a whole we firmly believe that our research Concept is able to drastically improve the 
product quality and reduce cost. The Concept is also very versatile where it is able to easily adapt into different 
industries such as the oil and gas industry.

Abstract 
Usually, market models analyse competition between firms with either quantity or price as decision’s variables. This 
paper considers mixed duopoly competitions in which a state-owned public firm and a private firm produce 
complementary goods. We analyse, separately, the model in which the state-owned public firm sets the price and the 
private firm chooses the output production; and the model in which the state-owned public firm sets the output 
production and the private firm chooses the price. By considering domestic and international models, we analyse the 
effects of opening the market to a foreign firm. We also compare the results obtained with different types of decision 
variables. This paper contributes to the understanding of the implications of firms’ decisions on social welfare. As a 
result, the paper shows that, in the domestic competition, social welfare is higher when the state-owned public firm 
sets price and the domestic private firm sets production outputs than in other competitions. Furthermore, when the 
market is opened to foreign firms, social welfare is higher when both firms set prices than in other competitions.

1. Introduction
The analysis of mixed oligopoly models has received significant attention in recent years. We can find such mixed 
markets in industries such as telecommunications, electricity, natural gas, airlines industries, as well as services 
including hospitals, banking and education. The usual models consider either competitions on quantities or 
competitions on prices (see, for instance, DeFraja and Delbono (1989), Hashimzade et al. (2007)). 
The internationalization markets is also a issue of interested. For instance, Fjel and Pal (1996) consider a mixed 
oligopoly model in which a public firm competes with both domestic and foreign private firms. 
Also, usually, the literature focus attention on models with firms producing imperfect substitutable, or differentiated, 
goods, and pay less attention to models with firms producing complementary goods (see Ohnishi (2010a) and Ohnishi 
(2010b)).  
Ohnishi (2010a) considers mixed duopoly models with firms producing imperfect substitutable goods, and compares 
the equilibrium outcomes of the results obtained in domestic and international competitions. Ohnishi (2010b) study 
the same issue, but by considering that the firms produce complementary goods.  
Ferreira and Ferreira (2018) extend the work of Ohnishi (2010a) to a triopoly market and with an imported tariff fixed 
by the home government.  
In this paper, we analyse, separately, the model in which the state-owned public firm sets the price and the private 
firm chooses the output production; and the model in which the state-owned public firm sets the output production 
and the private firm chooses the price (for models with different decision variables, see, for instance, Ohori (2014)).

Abstract 
DHS stands for Domestic Heating System. An algorithm for a low cost DHS was proposed and implemented using 
microcontrollers as part of an earlier research. This research presents the implementation of an efficient algorithm 
using the Artix-7 development board. Aritix-7 is one of the latest families of Field Programmable Gate Arrays 
(FPGAs) by Xilinx. Devices in this family feature up to 500 I/O pins, more than 200 logic cells, and more than 700 
DSP slices. Components of the DHS were implemented in VHDL, synthesized, simulated and tested using the Xilinx 
IDE. Important results have been reported and discussed. Suggestions for future work are also given as part of this 
paper.

Abstract 
Internet of Things (IoT) is a vision of integrated networks covering physical devices that can collect and 
exchange data. It enables unconnected applications and objects to become connected through 
communication technology such as radio frequency identification tags (RFID). This paper presents a 
conceptual study of a business model based on IoT technology using agent-based simulations (ABS) to 
determine IoT adoption and life cycle. Business model canvas is used to propose a predictive maintenance 
software business model; the physical objects of the system are integrated and connected to RFID tags and 
sensors to collect and exchange data stored in cloud-based system.  Subsequently, this will improve 
predictive analytics and hence attain better decision making. The behavior of the customer market in the 
USA is simulated using ABS to examine the potential of a proposed business model.

Introduction 
Business analytics is considered one of the most important areas today as many companies use business analytics prior 
to making decisions in their processes and operations. Business analytics use mathematical models and optimization 
techniques in order to augment the use of scarce resources as well as promote waste reduction in a company (Khalili-
Damghani, Sadi-Nezhad, Lotfi, & Tavana, 2013; Rabelo & Hughes, 2005). The aim of this paper is to propose a new 
business model based on Internet of Things (IoT) and predictive maintenance and to use simulation modeling to 
investigate the adoption of IoT technology. Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) model can be applied to capture and test 
the feasibility of such a business model as the proposed one. In addition, the flexibility and capability of the ABS 
models aid to capture system complexity and provide a meaningful result (Behdani, 2012; Demirel, 2006; Siebers, 
Macal, Garnett, Buxton, & Pidd, 2010). ABS modeling can be used in a wide range of fields, such as marketing, 
economics, and artificial intelligence; more recently, many conference proceedings and journal articles call for papers 
for ABS modeling, which shows the popularity and growth in this area (Macal & North, 2009). Well-known 
applications of ABS modeling applied in 1940’s include the Epidemic model and Schelling segregation (Borshchev, 
2013). 
This paper is organized into five sections including the introduction. Section 2 provides a brief review of literature 
related to ABS. Section 3 discusses our proposed business model. Section 4 shows a case study to demonstrate the 
application of ABS to simulate customer behavior of the IoT market in the United States. Finally, Section 5 concludes 
this research work and describes the future work.

Related Work 
In the 1990s, social scientists discovered the potential benefits of ABS modeling when they started to form research 
groups that investigated the use of ABS for modeling individuals’ behaviors (Brailsford, 2014; Macal & North, 2009). 
Recently, ABS was applied in areas where human behavior is important due to its powerful capability of capturing 
human behavior in detail and imitating system interactions and dynamics (Brailsford, 2014). Agents can also be part

Conclusion and Future Work 
In this hypothetical market model, ABS allowed us to simulate potential user behaviors which may results in useful 
predictions. Since testing the business model effectiveness based on Internet of Things using ABS is at an early stage, 
we concentrate more to provide a conceptual approach in this study by proposing a preliminary design. The future 
work includes the validation of ABS and increase the data sample size. The assumptions we made related to 
advertisement effectiveness and word of mouth influence need further investigation in order to simulate agents’

behavior variances   Also, system dynamics fragments can be included inside each agent of ABS to capture user’s 
behavior continuous in time. Lastly, agent demographics can be included by considering the exact physical locations 
of each agent in the United States in order to simulate the differences in customer behavior according to agent’s 
locations.

Abstract 
This work presents a study about the circular economy concept, based on the interest to understand how industries can 
adopt an innovative business model at the same time the environment’s conservation and the equilibrium between 
human beings and nature is promoted. This topic clearly includes both engineering and industrial management 
principles and that was seen as an opportunity to study the circular economy and its influence on enterprises, 
Portuguese ones in particular, but not only. The main idea was to gather the existing information, analyze it with 
practical examples of its application and comprehend how an interested industry can start applying it. The particular 
case of a Purchasing Department of a Portuguese company was used as test-bed. The main contribution of this work 
can be seen as a short story about Circular Economy, for non-familiar readers, as well as some directions for 
implementing circularity, in industry.

1. Introduction
Planet Earth is starting to show some signs of weakness, so more people try to think about how it has been treated 
over time. After the Industrial Revolution and bearing in mind the rapid pace at which technology and science are 
evolving, are we paying enough attention to what surrounds us? Are we contributing to a sustainable – or even more 
positive than that – development? Is not this an appropriate time to try understanding which new business and 
management opportunities are within our reach? 
The circular economy concept is becoming stronger over the last few years and it results from the critical analysis one 
can make about the way the world is developing. This idea is opposed to the linear economy concept, which is applied 
and unquestioned by most people and enterprises. Circular economy aims at supporting our planet and ourselves. 
Our planet is not getting bigger, but its population is increasing as is the consumption per capita, which is leading 
planet Earth to an unbearable situation (Foster et al. 2016). Moreover, in a world where resources are not unlimited, 
prices are becoming higher and unstable and disruptions in the supply chain are more common, which brings 
uncertainties to many aspects of our everyday life (Geissdoerfer et al. 2016). The production model practiced from 
the 18th century onwards, after the Industrial Revolution, when productivity and the level of production rose 
substantially, has led to an alarming situation, both environmentally and financially speaking (Foster et al. 2016). 
Since that time, the use of finite resources has gone up only (Lacy and Rutqvist 2015). 
Nowadays, production follows a linear model of continuous depletion of natural resources: taking, making, disposing. 
This model is being looked at with worries and more and more we see people willing to try and change things (Leitão 
2015). In addition to population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), primary energy use, water use, stratospheric

could also be a source for inspiration for other enterprises). This way, environmental aspects could be improved and, 
more than that: belonging to the platform could become a competitive advantage. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The circular economy is a rapidly growing concept which is gaining momentum in a lot of everyday aspects, including 
the way enterprises work. It includes a mentality change and the understanding that we will need to change the way 
we are developing. It is not only a matter of maintaining the environment healthy, but also a way of increasing 
competitiveness, reducing risks, dependency and unaffordable price. It is a way of creating more jobs and preparing 
for the future, considering the unsustainable way human race is evolving. 
Some practical examples were given, with the aim of inspiring towards this idea and a practical case was presented, 
with the goal of critically analyzing how one’s job may include this disruptive way of thinking. Interesting future 
developments would be the clear application of the concept throughout the company and the critical analysis of results. 
Our consumer reality is changing. People look for personalized products. Millennials buy online very easily and look 
for specific things, making the goods selling world come closer to the service-providing one. Moreover, there is a 
growing trend of people being concerned with the environmental and with the way they influence it.

With the most competitive suppliers for each reference, buyers must try to negotiate, mainly when talking about 
customized references. Based on the results and the total cost of ownership (TCO), the best option is selected, and the 
supplier is awarded. In most of the cases, the buyer tries to add possible second sources, so that if something happens 
with the main supplier, another can supply the material. Because of that, the basic conditions must be ensured. This 
includes the compliance with REACH and ROHS, norms that refer to the control of substances used in a certain 
product. 
This concern is also present in the process of buying material. Buying it cannot result from one person’s work alone. 
When it is necessary to buy something, one person does a shopping cart (SC), that is approved by one or more people 
(depending on the total value) and another person must convert the SC into a purchase order (PO). Moreover, if the 
PO is altered afterwards, this change needs to be approved as well. The four-eyes rule is, this way, applied. One person 
cannot buy material alone. 
When all suppliers are selected and approved, the conditions (like price, lead time, minimum order quantity, standard 
packaging quantity and incoterms) are established and the environmental compliance assured, another department 
becomes responsible of placing orders, based on the forecast of the product. The technical buyers’ department is only 
responsible for the development phase of the project. 
Purchasing engineering members are divided into projects. Projects may be completely new or a change of an already 
existing product. In the first case, it is more common to deal with more new references, but in both cases, it is natural 
to have a bill of materials (BOM) with a lot of material that is already used in the plant. To understand if the reference 
is new or not, one shall look at its status in SAP. The status indicates if the component exists or not, if it can be ordered, 
if it is awarded to a certain supplier, if environmental compliance is checked, if it is in the tool building phase, blocked, 
to be discontinued and so on. Depending on the status of the material, the tasks to overcome are different. The status 
which normally implies more work is when a material is new. 
 
4.2 Suggestions for Circularity 
 
If the circular economy is to be put into practice, all the involved people must be informed and understand its 
importance. The leadership question is crucial. People need to understand its advantages and work towards a common 
goal. It is not enough to have managers acknowledging something if the workers on levels below do not value it. On 
the other hand, it is not sufficient to have workers that believe in something if managers do not do it. 
Each department has its set of responsibilities and tasks, but they are all interconnected and able to influence each 
other. 
In the purchasing engineering department, concern about the environment is already present; the company asks for 
compliance regarding REACH, ROHS and ROHS Future. One way to include the circular economy concept is to add 
it to the compliance report. This does not mean it should be mandatory for every supplier to have a certificate, for 
example, but to have an idea of those who are trying to apply it and briefly comprehend how. That could also have 
impact in the decision of what suppliers to contact for a certain reference. Imagine that for a certain reference, we look 
at the material group and find out there are 15 potential suppliers. Let us also imagine that, considering the expected 
purchasing volume, 3 suppliers must be contacted. The decision of which suppliers to contact is not random, and the 
suppliers are rated according to a lot of aspects. These aspects include lead times, prices, quality records, compliance, 
incoterms, conditions of payment and so on. Circular economy could also be added to the equation here, giving 
enterprises that apply it a better value when compared to others. 
Another way to show how the concept is given importance is to actually apply the concept, giving the example. Taking 
the influence power that the technical buyer can have, it would also be interesting to, in a positive way, challenge the 
engineering responsible to follow the concept. We have, over the course of this work, understood that there are simple 
things we can do that are related to the circular economy, but it is also clear that major changes will inevitably be 
needed, and those changes affect the development phase in the early phase, even before the technical buyers are 
involved in the process. The product itself must be thought of considering its immediate use and all that follows it. 
The department of Research and Development has a very crucial role here. A new product must be thought of taking 
this concern into account since the very beginning of the development. On the other hand, the company shall be 
prepared to give incentive to repairing the equipment sold. The whole mindset must be changed, and departments need 
to understand the contribution they can have to the successful implementation of such a new mentality and way of 
thinking and doing things. 
Now, there is still not a global European certification regarding the circular economy, specifically. However, that 
could be an interesting part of the solution for the future. A platform would exist to clearly inform all the concerned 
public about which enterprises include the circular economy into their processes and products and how they do it (this

Abstract 
The growing competitiveness and rapid technological innovation has placed tremendous pressure on companies to 
embrace outsourcing as a corporate strategy. One type of business that uses an outsourcing strategy is aircraft 
maintenance. The role of customers in the aviation industry is increasingly being highlighted because high quality 
services are vital to the viability of airlines and are critical to the competitiveness of the aviation industry itself. 
Application of service quality to identify and anlyze the attribute of customer expectations in depth, and if applied 
optimally, can be used as basic reference for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul companies to develop 
company’s strategy.

1. Introduction
The growing competitiveness and rapid technological innovation has placed tremendous pressure on companies to 
embrace outsourcing as a corporate strategy. Arround 77% of large companies in Europe, Asia, North America and 
Latin America was using outsource strategy. These companies use outsourcing projects to support functions such as 
cleaning and catering. In general, outsource strategy is focusing on cost reduction. They realize that non-core functions 
can be outsourced to utilize the different types of knowledge and expertise available in the industry and enhance their 
own core competencies. Therefore, they can use their limited resources to focus on their core competencies without 
sacrificing their performance. 
Outsource strategy is also popular in aircraft industry. Currently airlines tend to use outsource strategies for areas that 
are not their core business, one of which is in the field of aircraft maintenance as it is considered capable of transferring 
risks associated with regulation and at a reasonable cost (Rieple, 2008; McFadden and Worrells, 2012). FAA (2008) 
found that airlines allocated an average of 64% of their maintenance costs in 2007, compared to 37% in 1996, for 
outsourcing aircraft maintenance, covering everything from repairing critical components, such as landing gear and 
engine repairs and to the structure. Outsourcing MRO allows airlines to avoid significant capital investment in the 
facilities, equipment and supply of parts and components (Tang and Elias, 2012), therefore airlines with large fleets 
tend to have their own aircraft maintenance centers rather than airlines with small fleets or low-cost carrier (Phillips, 
2008). 
The role of customers in the aviation industry is increasingly being highlighted because high-quality services are 
critical to airline survival and are critical to the competitiveness of the aviation industry itself. MRO's treatment in

The last but not least, the average difference of the attribute reliability is -0.556, which is still negative which means 
that the attribute empathy is still far below customer expectations. Although troubleshoots have matched customer 
expectations, they are still vulnerable to being below customer expectations. Therefore, being the largest attribute 
among the other attributes shows that all attributes of reliability, quality of on-time performance work, and 
troubleshoots on MROs in Indonesia should be prioritized as key attributes that must be promptly corrected if they 
are to enhance global competitiveness.  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Through this paper, MRO in Indonesia today when compared with customer expectation, that the 4 customer needs 
have exceeded customer expectations, but 11 customer needs are still below customer expectations. Even if averaged, 
all ServQual attributes for MRO in Indonesia are still below customer expectations. This shows the challenge of MRO 
in Indonesia to be able to increase competitiveness in global level. When analyzed from the results of this ServQual 
there are two main things that can be the focus of MRO companies in Indonesia that is quality management and supply 
chain management. Therefore, more in-depth research on quality management and supply chain management based 
on MRO's customer needs in Indonesia is needed to improve the competitiveness of MRO in Indonesia at global level.

Abstract 
In this paper, A new formula of longshore sediment transport rate was developed based on phenomena of fluid 
movement through the sediment particle. The amount of fluid that penetrates the sediment particles with high 
permeability more than the sediment particles with low permeability. This formula is applied to identify shoreline 
erosion around of runway platform of Sultan Mahmud Airport, Kuala Terengganu. The shoreline changes model is 
solved by using finite difference method. Based on the simulation result by using this method, shoreline profile

to 42.93m. These results show that in the future the erosion will affect the coastal communities. Based on these 
results, it can be considered future steps to prevent this disaster.

Abstract 
Generalized Space Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model was used to model the time series data that had 
correlation inter-location (space time). In the stage of model identification, spatial weight on GSTAR model 
shown relations of inter-location, which were weight normalized cross-correlation, binary, uniform, and 
inverse of distance. Data grouping uses the CLARANS (Clustering Large Application based on 
Randomized Search) Cluster analysis method, which is a clustering method that involves spatial elements 
by determining the number of clusters at the beginning where each object has the opportunity to be selected 
as a cluster center. The data used was secondary data of Farmer Exchange Rates in 32 provinces for 71 
months from year 2005 to 2013, which has been obtained from the Economic Indicators published by BPS 
every month. Model candidates that have been obtained of the data were GSTAR(1;1) and GSTAR(2;1;1).

Abstract 
Multicollinearity is the condition that there is a correlation between independent variables which is a problem. This 
event often occurs in regression analysis. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method 
regression can reduce multicollinearity and increase the accuracy of linear regression models. The lasso parameter 
estimator can be solved by the LARS (Least Angle Regression and Shrinkage) algorithm which calculates the 
correlation vector, the largest absolute correlation value, equiangular vector, inner product vector, and determines 
the LARS algorithm limiter for LASSO. LASSO method regression with a more detailed procedure and selecting the 
best model using the 𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝 Mallows statistics is discussed in this paper. LASSO method will be applied to Indonesia's 
foreign exchange deposit data.

Abstract 
The norm space is the pairs of  vector space with defined norm in the vector space. An example of vector 
space is ℓ𝑝𝑝. Vector space ℓ𝑝𝑝 is a space that contains all real number sequences that satisfy the sums of all 
elements in ℓ𝑝𝑝 normed space. Furthermore at ℓ𝑝𝑝 can be defined as a norm-2 ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝, that is equal to the 
sum of all 2 dimensional matrix determinant in norms in ℓ𝑝𝑝, such that ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝൯ is a 2-normed space. 
Result of this study is seeking at the completeness of 2-normed space ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝൯by utilizing the 
completeness of norm space ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝൯.

Abstract 
Graph applications develop quite rapidly in the transportation system. One of the applications is used to search for 
travel routes. The route from a terminal to an intersection that must be passed exactly once and must return to the 
original terminal is a very important issue. Determination of the TMB travel route (Trans Metro Bandung) using the 
Nearest Neighbor method. The results show that the TMB bus journey on corridor 2 (Cibeureum - Cicaheum) can be 
formulated into graph form. The bus transportation system is modeled in graph using the point symbol (Vertex) as a 
shelter and edge symbol as a path that connects between shelters. The TMB bus route in the graph is a closed track 
and is called the Hamilton Cycle. The results of route calculation and search from TMB corridor 2 produce different 
routes and distances from the initial, including: St. Ah. Nasution - St. Ahmad Yani - St. Ibrahim Adjie - St. Jakarta - 
St. Ahmad Yani - St. Asia Afrika - St. Sudirman - St. Rajawali Barat - St. Elang - St. Rajawali Timur - St. Kebon

Abstract 
In this paper, the effect of boosting interferon alpha (INF-α) in immunotherapy by using mathematical 
modeling was analyzed. In this model, tumor growth is described as a tumor cells population with 
immunotherapy. This model also describes the effect of interferon alpha (INF-α) on dynamics of tumor 
cells. Numerical modeling of immunotherapy with or not boosted interferon alpha (INF-α) is presented in 
this paper. We obtained that boosting interferon alpha (INF-α) in immunotherapy have a very significant 
role in killing of tumor cells. Interferon alpha (INF-α) that administered in 4 pulses from day 1 to day 34 
to strength 4.8 can still kill the tumor, but when it was reduced to strength 4.7 cannot kill the tumor.

Figure 4 and Figure 5 shows that reduction INF-α that administered in 4 pulses from day 1 to day 34 to strength 4.8 
MU can still kill the tumor, but when it was reduced to strength 4.7 MU cannot kill the tumor. These results imply 
that to obtain optimal treatment is limited to using interferon alpha of 4.8. When using above that limit will increase 
the possibility of the side effects from the drug. Whereas, it is below the limit it will not be able to treat the tumor. 
 
4. Conclusion  
Based on numerical results, we can conclude that the boosting of interferon alpha (INF-α) on immunotherapy has a 
very significant role in killing tumor cells. Boosting interferon alpha (INF-α) in immunotherapy is more effective if 
done in one month with administered in 4 pulses at strength 4.8 MU. The result of this simulation will be the optimal 
limit for the administration of interferon alpha in immunotherapy. So that, the side effects of INF-α drugs can be 
minimized

Abstract 
In this paper the process improvement activity in a production system towards streamlining the 
production flow using the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) model for manufacturing industries was 
investigated by focusing on the waste of overburden (muri) for manual handling process. Currently the 
implementation of the continuous improvement in industries has numerous versions focusing on the 
elimination of the wastes (muda) but less consideration of work on overburden (muri). One of the issues 
in continuous improvement activity in manufacturing industries is to overlook other wastes as defined by 
Lean Manufacturing (LM) which are Mura and Muri. Targeting on the optimizing and streamlining the 
production flow, the detailed steps and processes of PDCA were used in this research based on 
experiences, knowledges and availability of the data collection. Thus, in this paper, detailed adaptation 
process for each phase in PDCA was investigated through published literature, current implementation of 
PDCA in case study industry and performance of the production system in the case study industry. Based 
on the investigation and implementation of the case study industry, the result shows an adaptation of 
PCDA in eliminating the waste of overburden (muri) with suitable tools for each phase complements well 
with the continuous improvement program. The production output as determined through the developed 
PCDA tools increased by 17.7% by the end of continuous improvement program.

products in the future.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, PDCA methodology has successfully implemented focusing on elimination the waste of 
overburden (muri) in selected case study of manufacturing industry to streamline the production flow. The PDCA 
methodology is one of the method has been adopted in various types of industries because systematic approach to 
analyze the background of the continuous improvement activity step by step. The PDCA method is defined as 
project objectives and existing processes, measuring of the existing processes, analyze the data to determine the 
cause-and-effect relationships and improve the current process. PDCA methodology helps companies realize that it 
is a company-wide approach to eliminating production wastes. But, the PDCA methodology is only the platform of 
the continuous improvement activity with several versions of identification the application tools for every phase.

Abstract 
The arrival and capabilities of Blockchain is set to change the traditional supply chain activities. The tracking all types 
of transaction more transparently and securely using Blockchain motivate us to explore the opportunities Blockchain 
offers across the supply chain. This paper explores opportunities for use of Blockchain technology in supply chains. 
Particularly, examine whether Blockchain technology makes a good fit for use in an Australian manufacturer supply 
chain. Blockchain allows us to have permissioned or permission-less distributed ledgers where stakeholders can 
interact with each other. It details how Blockchain works and the mechanism of hash algorithms which allows for 
greater security of information. Case study focuses on the supply chain management and looks at the intricacies of an 
Australian manufacturers supply chain. We present a summary of opportunities for using Blockchain technology in 
supply chains in an Australian manufacturing case study. The summary is proposed in using private Blockchain in the 
case study. The opportunities using Blockchain technology has the potential to bring greater transparency, validity 
across the supply chain, and improvement of communication between stakeholders involved.

1 Introduction 
Today’s current cloud-based application services rely on a single trusted entity that manages the network, storage 
and software. The amount of data being created and collected in cloud-based applications is growing at an exponential 
rate. This growth is primarily due to technology advances in devices which are known as the ‘Internet of Things’ 
(IOT) and the significance of computer power and availability of storage resources. The emergence of IoT means an 
increase in connectivity and information sharing and therefore a need for increasing trust and efficiency in transactions 
which may impact the supply chain and its resilience to recover from all kinds of disruptions (Mondragon, Mondragon, 
& Coronado, 2018). Data is evolving and becoming part of everyday human activity, from product goods being 
sourced, product manufacturing and delivery of products to end consumers.  The increase in data has provided 
opportunity for new approaches and techniques to create, store, analyse and obtain useful insight from the supply 
chain.  
The emergence of blockchain technology has brought innovative possibilities extended from financial services to 
supply chain management, intelligent manufacturing and IOT. Supply chains represent all the links that are involved 
in the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing of goods, and the distribution of a finished product to the end 
consumer. They can span from over hundreds of stages and multiple geographical locations which makes it complex 
to trace events in the supply chain and investigate any issues (Arshinder, Kanda, & Deshmukh, 2008). To date,

5 Conclusion 
 
The general spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) makes the idea of integrating Blockchains in existing transaction 
supply chains the more significant. It will facilitate the creation of new supply chains to support the spread of sensor 
technologies. Supply Chains are highly complex as they involve many stakeholders who conflicting interests and 
priorities as well as the use of multiple systems. This paper presents an opportunity to use Blockchain to improve the 
current supply chain. Blockchain can enable various upstream and downstream parties in supply chain to verify the 
authenticity of a block of items. When stakeholders agree to work with Blockchain technology they are agreeing for 
an intensely collaborative journey. For this to happen, the paper describes where Blockchain can integrate its use in 
the flow of the supply chain. The supply chain demonstrated in the case study is a large part of an organisation and it 
involves internal and external stakeholders. It is possible that not all parties will participate in this technology, 
however, the idea is compelling as it enables private deployment of Blockchains in supply chain management. The 
novelty of this paper lies in where Blockchain can store all transaction information in the supply chain of the proposed 
case study. This will allow organisations to leverage a variety of Blockchain applications and solutions to help in the 
transparency, traceability and authenticity of information. The use of the Blockchain technology also creates a culture 
of collaboration between all stakeholders. Recently, IBM is experimenting with a system called Adept that permits 
exchange among billions of interconnected devices using a Blockchain approach. It has developed a semi-autonomous 
device based on Internet of Things concept integrated with the Blockchain with the collaboration of Samsung. This 
device is a kind of intelligent washing machine which can manage its own consumables supply like ordering detergent 
as required, perform its own self-service and maintenance, and even optimize its environment by negotiating with 
other peer devices in the home or outside.  Technology leaders believe that Blockchain will do for transactions what 
the internet did for information. One potential issue that needs to be considered in the use of Blockchain is that if the 
first Block in the chain the geneis is created without a trustworthy source and each additional Block thereafter is also 
agreed on by the Blockchain stakeholders then theoretically this chain of events can be unreliable. Compared to 
conventional centralised databases and computational platforms (on-premises or cloud), blockchains can reduce some 
counter-party and operational risks by providing neutral ground between organisations [20]. Blockchain within supply 
chain can improve transparency and traceability from how goods are made, where they come from and how they are 
managed. Data in the blockchain becomes permanent and is easily shared, giving supply chain stakeholders a more 
comprehensive track and trace capability. For future studies we will invite domain experts to evaluate the proposed 
method in a real-world application. There is still much that is unknown about the blockchain-based systems [20]. 
Further research is required to improve our knowledge about how to create blockchain-based systems that work and 
creating Blockchain-based systems that work as required.

Abstract 
The power quality disturbance in a power distribution network was voltage sag and swell and voltage harmonic. 
New ideas, methods and techniques had been introduced by researchers to improve the quality of supply particularly 
at the sensitive load end. Many of these methods have their own drawbacks such as complexity, slow response and 
sensitivity to parameter variations. In this research, an improved Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) topology has 
been designed and modeled to be used on a 415 Volts distribution network. A seven level cascaded multilevel 
inverter using multicarrier SPWM technique controller was proposed to handle the voltage imperfections. An 
innovative controller based on the Synchronous Rotating Reference Frame (SRRF) to overcome the disadvantages 
of the existing controller schemes by reducing the complexity, number of signal measurements and computing time 
has been developed. The controller was able to control the zero sequence voltage during unbalance fault period. The 
switching frequency of the phase shift SPWM was low and hence, the switching loss was low. The Total Harmonic 
Distortion (THD) with the proposed DVR was significantly reduced to 1.64 % as compared to other traditional 
models and was within the IEEE Standards 519-2014. The proposed controller algorithm provides excellent voltage 
compensation.

Background of the study 
Power quality has gained tremendous attention since the late 1980s. Three parties are most concerned about power 
quality (PQ). They are utility companies, equipment manufacturers, and the end consumers (Wilson E. Kazibwe 
1993). The end customer wants to know how the power disturbances will affect sensitive loads and the correct 
mitigation techniques required. The manufacturers need to know the practical electrical environment so that they can 
design equipment with reasonable tolerances or the ride through capability. The utility wants to know the user 
generated disturbances, which can affect the neighboring customers. There are two terms known in power systems 
about the quality of power: good power quality and poor power quality. Good power quality means the power 
supply is always available, within the voltage and frequency tolerances and has a pure sinusoidal wave shape to all 
equipment, because most electrical equipment was designed on that basis (IEC 61000-4-30 2003). Unfortunately, 
most of the equipment that is manufactured also distorts the supply voltage, (R.C. Sermon 2005) which is known as 
poor power quality. This will affect other equipment that was designed with the expectation of consistent undistorted 
voltage, and are thus sensitive to power disturbances resulting in reduced performance and will cause equipment 
mal-operation or premature failure (A. Rash 1998). In general, power quality disturbances comprise of a wide range 
of problems such as voltage sag, voltage swell, transients, over voltage, unbalance, harmonics, flicker, interruptions 
and notches. The most serious of all the disturbances are voltage sag, voltage swell and harmonics. A voltage sag 
condition implies that the voltage on one or more phase drops below the specified tolerance for a short period of 
time. Due to the insufficient energy availability, the equipment may mal-operate or trip. These activities cause 
production loss and heavy financial losses (Bhim Singh and Ambrish 2015). A voltage swell condition occurs when 
the voltage of one or more phase rises above the specified tolerance for a short period of time. Harmonic distortion 
in a power network is developed by devices with nonlinear operating characteristics. The cost of power quality

Effectiveness on sag mitigation  
Single line-to-ground fault was created between time 0.1 sec and 0.2 sec for duration of 100 ms.  For 100 ms, the 
DVR starts injecting the required compensating voltage. The voltages at the sensitive load was balanced, sinusoidal 
with no ripples and overshoot and was at its rated value, as shown in Figure 4.2.

4.3 
Effectiveness on swell mitigation  
As observed from Figure 4.3, the amplitude of supply voltage was increased about 15% from its nominal voltage. 
The DVR reacted quickly to inject the appropriate voltage component (negative voltage magnitude) to correct the 
load voltage. As can be seen from the results, the load voltage is kept at the nominal value 340 V by the DVR.

Conclusions 
In this research the effectiveness of the proposed controller for DVR has been investigated. The innovative new 
control scheme was able to mitigate the voltage imperfections very efficiently. With the 7-level phase shifted 
multilevel inverter, there was a significant reduction in THD and a better performance. The 7-level inverter was a

significant tradeoff between the number of hardware, control and performance requirement and the allowed THD. 
The DVR has improved the quality of voltage at the sensitive load end. This paper will be helpful to other 
researchers who are keen on power quality improvement in the power distribution network

ABSTRACT
This research analysed why there is in control and out of control when it comes to defects. Examines the data 
gathered and find out where the defects fell out of control. Minimization of defects is a must. From out of control, 
they need to make it in control. To understand if data should have to revise, they will use u chart to be able to know 
if the data gathered is in control or out of control. Using mini tab, it will give an accurate value of limits and a red 
point when the point is out of control. But if it doesn’t, it is in control and in some other ways we can calculate it 
with the given formulas to get the control limit. When it is out of control, points that exceed from its limit should be 
eliminated. When it is in control, it doesn’t need to be eliminated. The gathered data results to out of control. 
There’s one point that exceeds the limit. Revision of gathered data will make the defects in control.

INTRODUCTION
Competitive in the manufacturing companies today become more and more fierce. They wanted to produce product 
beyond their limit just to meet customer’s demand and to gain profits without giving an importance on the quality 
control in the production system. These quality controls are very important to have high quality products and to 
avoid non-conformance. It is a must in every company to stay in the competition. Without knowing the quality 
control, there are consequences that the company can get. This includes higher percentage of defects that is 
considered as wastes. It includes waste of raw materials as well as waste of time and money. Rejects should be 
lessened for higher production. Also, losses are the one companies should get rid of. If they do not, these losses will 
make their company go down as a result of being out of the completion or simply kicked out in the industry which 
as company, never wishes to happen. Defects may seem to be inevitable but it can be reduced. 
Sunbless Industrial Corporation was built in the 1920. They have been in the industry for almost nine years. Their 
manufacturing arm is located at 240 Fresno Street, Pasay City while their marketing arm is at C.M Recto. The 
company produces three types of products: (a) bond papers, (b) envelops, and (c) notebooks. They also have three 
brand names namely Corona, Green Apple, and Blue Feather. They have two kinds of notebooks. These are spiral 
notebooks and bind notebooks.

Based from the figure above, the upper control limit is 0.5752, the centre line is 0.1701 and lower control limit is 0. 
We can compute the control limit using the computation above it will also give same value from the graph. Since, 
there’s no point that exceeds the control limit. Hence, the graph is in control.

CONCLUSION 
 We, the researchers conclude that defects are inevitable. In 50 samples there’s a point that exceed the control limit 
as shown in the figure 1. Since the point exceeds the control limit, we need to eliminate this defect to make the non-
conformance in control. It is important to use u chart to know the limit of defects. In other words, defects should not 
go beyond its capacity. Quality control is a must to avoid too much defects.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on a recent variant of the Orienteering Problem (OP), namely the Capacitated Team OP (CTOP) 
which arises in the logistics industry. In this problem, each node is associated with a demand that needs to be satisfied 
and a score that need to be collected. Given a set of homogeneous fleet of vehicles, the objective is to find a path for 
each vehicle in order to maximize the total collected score, without violating the capacity and time budget. We propose 
an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm for solving the CTOP. Two strategies, either accepting a new solution as 
long as it improves the quality of the solutions or accepting a new solution as long as there is no constraint violation, 
are implemented. For solving difficult instances, we simplify the move operator of local search in order to reduce the 
computational time. Instead of exploring all possible nodes in all paths to be moved, we only focus on nodes in the 
path with the least remaining amount of time. Computational experiments on benchmark instances illustrate that the 
algorithm can generate solutions within 1% and 4% from the current best known solution for small and large instances, 
respectively.

1. Introduction
Orienteering Problem (OP) is an NP-hard routing problem in which the objective is to find a subset of nodes to be 
visited by a vehicle, and in what order, such that the total score collected from the visited nodes is maximized while 
complying to limited the time budget constraint (Vansteenwegen et al. 2011). The OP is first introduced by Tsiligirides 
(1984). According to the latest survey paper on OP by Gunawan et al. (2016), numerous extended variants of OP, each 
with its own unique constraints, have been researched on extensively in the past few years. This work focuses on a 
particular variant of OP called the Capacitated Team Orienteering Problem (CTOP).  
CTOP is highly relevant to real-world problems, especially in the logistics industry. In this variant of OP, each node 
is associated with a demand and a profit. Given a set of homogeneous fleet of vehicles, the main objective is to 
determine a route for each available vehicle that maximizes the total score (profit) while complying to capacity and 
time budget constraints that each vehicle has (Archetti et al. 2009). It is assumed that each node can only be visited 
once by one vehicle. All vehicles start and end at the same node, which is the depot. In the context of the OP, each

4.2 Computational Results 
 
The parameter values are defined as follows: MAXITER = 1000, LOWERLIMIT = 250 and MAXNOIMPROV = 10. Tables 
1 summarizes results obtained by ILS for both sets of instances. Each instance is run five times. The gap values are 
calculated by comparing our results with the best known solutions. Table 4 summarizes the results of Archetti’s 
instances. It does not improve any current best known solution, partly because most of the solutions are proven to be 
optimal. The gap values are calculated by comparing our results with the best known solutions. The gap values are 
less than 0.50 %. In Subset 1 of Archetti et al. instances, both can obtain the best known solutions except for one 
instance. For Subset 2 with 90 instances, ILS(R1) obtains 70 best known solutions, while ILS(R2) obtains 80 best 
known solutions, though at the expense of computation time. Finally, ILS can get 24 best known solutions for Subset 
3. For the Archetti et al. instances, we conclude that the performance of ILS is thus promising.

For Tarantilis et al. instances, ILS also performs well at the expense of computation time. But the results are still worse 
than those of best known solutions, with the gap values being up to 3.09%. However, ILS is able to improve one best 
known solution of instance 14 of Subset 2, from 509 to 602. Our ILS has some limitations especially pertaining to the 
large computation time.

5. Conclusions 
 
In this paper, we focus on solving the Capacitated Team Orienteering Problem (CTOP). The CTOP is a variant of the 
TOP where each node is associated with a demand and a score. The main objective is to determine a path for each 
available vehicle in order to maximize the total score, without violating the capacity and time budget of each vehicle. 
Iterated Local Search (ILS) metaheuristic is proposed in order to solve the benchmark instances of CTOP.  
 
The proposed ILS uses different types of strategies for implementing operators of local search for different types of 
benchmark CTOP instances. For Archetti’s instances, we implement two different strategies when accepting the 
operators, either the operator is able to improve the quality of the solution or it only increases the remaining time 
budget that can be used for other nodes. For Tarantilis’s instances, the move operator is modified. Instead of exploring 
all possible moves from all nodes, we only consider of moving nodes in the path with the least remaining time budget. 
 
The performance of the proposed algorithm was promising. It is able to generate solutions within 1% from the current 
best known solution for small instances, and within 4% for large instances, giving an average of 2.20% for all 
instances. Since the chosen acceptance criterion has a critical influence on the performance of the proposed algorithm, 
a possible improvement of the algorithm could involve also considering worst solutions during the search which is 
used in Simulated Annealing. Some possible extensions of local search operators would be explore as future works. 
Since the OP and its variants, such as the Arc Orienteering Problem and the Team OP with Soft Time Windows, have 
attracted more attention in recent years, the proposed algorithm can be potentially tailored to solve them as well.

Engineering Education through Students’  
Engagement in Virtual Learning Space

Abstract 
Virtual Reality is likely to be a part of future education especially when addressing the Net Generation also known 
as Generation Why. Delivering course material via a virtual environment is beneficial to them because it offers the 
interactivity and social presence. As student and educator become interconnected through collaboration and 
interaction, the virtual environment becomes perpetual learning experience. VR in engineering education offers the 
ability to explore places, simulate machines functional or practices technical processes without leaving the 
classroom. Plus, educator can demonstrate dangerous or complex task in the virtual environment, and students can 
try completing the task repeatedly, minus the cost and danger.  
Even though many studies have linked virtual technologies with improvements in students’ academic performance 
and motivation [1,2,3,4], students’ social and collaborative skills [5], and students’ psychomotor and cognitive skills 
[6,7]. The actual usage of virtual in engendering education is still relatively low. The drawbacks are caused by not 
enough VR content available, too expensive VR devices and difficulty in delivering VR contents to capture 
students’ engagement.  
Thus, we are introducing ViLeCube, that aims in providing a solution by developing an interactive cross-device and 
cross-platform virtual learning space for building deep students’ engagement. Cross-device means a user does not 
need to have expensive head mounted display (HMD) such as Rift, but he or she could experience our virtual 
learning space using only smart phone or desktop computer, with or without the HMD. Cross-platform means our 
solution could be deploy into several different platform such as Android, iOs and Windows. Interaction in our 
solution will be a real time interaction of voice and gesture in multiplayer setting. 
The basic concept of ViLeCube is a cloud learning environment, where engineers and students can join in from 
anywhere using their computer or mobile devices. Inside the ViLeCube, engineer can directly speak and show 
simple gesture to interact with virtual machines parts or explain engineering concepts. Gesture is control by gaze 
direction and locomotion sensors inside mobile devices. Students are able to respond in their lesson using voice, 
button selection and chatting (optional).  
The first prototype has been develop and tested in computer engineering subject, where three problem based 
situations are created.  The preliminary result reveals that educators and students are keen to use ViLeCube in their 
engineering subject. Students engagements are measured during problem solving situation, where we found that the 
engagement are raise due to representation of avatar. Most students felt that these avatars increase self confidence 
and allows them to experience more of hostile situations.

Abstract 
The study investigates innovation value chain (IVC) which consists of knowledge sourcing, transformation, and 
exploitation activities performed by UK manufacturing firms. This study is worthwhile to be conducted for the 
following reasons. First, this study investigates a broader source of knowledge than majority of innovation studies that 
is classified into R&D activities, informal knowledge and formal cooperation. Second, this study tested both 
technological (i.e. product and process) and non-technological (i.e. organizational and marketing) innovation, hence, 
the impact of knowledge transformation on both innovation as well as the exploitation of both types innovation on 
firms’ performance is tested. While, majority of innovation studies tend to employ technological innovation. In terms 
of the first link in the IVC, synergistic relationships exist within and between each group source of knowledge (i.e. 
R&D, informal knowledge and formal cooperation). In the second link in the IVC, both internal and external R&D 
appear to have a direct impact on innovation. Formal cooperation provides a greater contribution to innovation than 
informal cooperation. However, such cooperation is more likely to be conducted with market/commercials network. 
In the last link in the IVC, there is no single positive and significant contribution in terms of the link between product 
innovation (including new to the market and firm innovations) and firms’ performance. Only process innovation that 
has positive contribution on firm performance.

Abstract 
 
This study investigates the risk factors associated with the Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) of the fabricators and 
welders working in the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC). To identify the level of discomfort of the fabricators and welders, 
we used the “Standardized Nordic Questionnaire”. Standardized Nordic Questionnaire is used for the analysis of the 
MSDs. By analyzing the results of the survey, problem areas in workers body are identified. Nowadays, work 
processes analysis by using computer software are widely used. we attempted to assess welders’ posture and its 
biomechanical analysis by using JACK Digital Human Modeling Software and Simulation. Moreover, this study 
focuses on three working postures that occur during welding processes which are welding in standing position, sitting 
position and kneeling position. After determining the target postures, digital human models were simulated in the 
JACK software to improve workers health to reduce MSD pains. There are several assessment tools that support 
discovering MSD related risk factors such as Lower Back Analysis, Rabid Upper Limb assessment (RULA), Static 
Strength Prediction (SSP), Fatigue analysis and Ovako Working posture Assessment System (OWAS). In this study, 
RULA, OWAS, SSP, Lower back analysis, and Fatigue analysis were performed on the human digital models. The 
analytical results were directly extracted from the JACK software. The results of these postures evaluated, and it is 
found that immediate corrective actions are required for some postures. In addition, biomechanical analysis of forces 
in all those postures revealed forces higher than the recommended limit by the National Institute for Occupational

Abstract 
A hazard is any source of potential damage, harm or adverse health effects on something or someone. Hazards have 
big impact on individuals and the community, where hazards are the main reason behind accidents and safety 
problems. Hazards have a high probability of happening in workplaces. Subsequently, hazard analysis techniques are 
methods that reduce or monitor hazards in our daily life and workplaces. Workplace environment have different types 
of hazard such as ergonomic, physical, biological, chemical, and others. Hazard analysis requires a process of 
observation, data collection and writing a report to identify and analyze hazards. The occupational hazards can be 
reduced through using detailed hazard analysis techniques such as Failure Mode and Effects of Analysis (FMEA), 
Hazard and Operability Review (HAZOP), and Risk Assessment. Since hazard analysis requires statistical data 
collection and writing report while safety engineers is observing the hazards, a tool such as a mobile application will 
reduce the time and the paper work by converting safety engineers’ observation to a report immediately. Therefore, it 
is important to develop mobile application that will help safety engineers to assess detailed hazard analysis in a quick 
and systematic way. In this project, we are developing mobile application for hazard analysis for safety engineers, 
which will be considered as a tool ready to use during risk assessment.

Abstract 
Food waste has been a growing issue in supply chain management (SCM) research. The number of articles in 
international journal and conferences papers consistently rises in the last decade. This paper examines the 
publication trend of food waste research, particularly in the supply chain context. 108 articles in Scopus database 
published in 2006 to 2018 are reviewed. The papers are classified based on the type of food waste, keywords, 
method used, and future research issues. This study provides an basis for SCM researchers in understanding the 
potential development of the current research for food waste in supply chain.  
Keywords - Food waste, supply chain, literature review 
1. INTRODUCTION
Food waste is a removed food and no longer feasible to be consumed by humans because of the damage or 
other causes. While food wastage includes both, food lost and food waste (Parfitt et al. 2010). In general, wasted 
food is not used can be called food loss or food wastage. According to the FAO, food waste is food that is available 
and consumed but the food has decreased the weight and nutritional value (Najoan et al. 2016). 
One of the food waste with the high risk is agricultural industry food. Agricultural industry food is easily decayed 
and damaged, for instance fruit and vegetable in one supply chain (harvesting, handling, distributing, and marketing) 
(Salemdeeb et al. 2017). Managing agriculture and food logistics in Indonesia are still traditional in controlling 
method, harvesting, disrupting disaster (Syahrir et al. 2015) and decaying as an impact of distribution process 
(Vanany et al. 2010 and Vanany et al. 2016) become important causes of high food waste in Indonesia. 
Food waste has become a problem in various countries of the world, one of which France and Germany 
became a serious European country facing food waste. France requires supermarkets to hand over food to a charity. 
Food waste has reached the European Parliament and the issuance of the rules of utilization of food waste in the 
supermarket. Then, supermarket must sell the defective vegetables with the lower price than the ordinary vegetables. 
(Parfitt et.all 2010, Lozano,2014) 
    In its implementation, the industry needs to consider food waste of vegetables and fruits, starting from 
upstream suppliers, factories, distributions, downstream that is distributors and consumers (Parfitt et al. 2010). 
Research in the UK in 2011 found the amount of food waste for vegetables and fruits about 1.3 billion tons per year, 
that number represents one-third of the food produced for human consumption. The country is progressing 1,500 
calories per day per person wasted in vain. In developing countries too, an estimated 400-500 calories per day per 
person is wasted, of which 40% of losses occur in retail and consumers, another 40% of losses occur post-harvest 
and processing. so the total food waste consumed in industrialized countries reached 222 million tons. 
    Recent research conducted by the World Food Agency FAO along with research institutes for organic 
farming and London School of Economics shows the increasing threat of food waste vegetables and fruits are 
wasted on food security and sustainability. Now a third or 1.7 billion tons per year of total world food production is 
lost as waste. The value of economic losses or direct losses amounts to one trillion US dollars (Salomone 2016). Not 
only that, the hidden costs or losses by food waste of vegetables and fruits also cover the negative impact on the 
environment (global environmental costs) which is estimated to reach the value of US $ 700 billion and social costs 
(social costs) US $ 900 billion. So the total loss due to global food waste reaches the US $ 2.6 trillion per year or 4% 
of the world's gross product. 
 
This paper describes the literature review related to the food waste supply chain. this study is limited to food 
waste in supply chain issues. This paper aims to contribute to further research focusing on optimizing the model of

Abstract: 
The revolution in technology has completely transformed the way business organizations operate, serve and retain 
their customers. The new phenomenon of information technology has set in motion a new paradigm in the services 
sector for providing better services. Due to the intangibility of services, it has always been challenging to satisfy the 
customers, and hence to measure and rate the service quality. As the information technology has taken over most 
aspects of our life, the delivery of services has transformed from traditional to electronic channels making its quality 
even more challenging to measure and maintain. The service quality has now become e-service quality. The previously 
established models in service quality have been rendered less useful due to the varying nature of traditional services 
and e-services. This resulted in the need of either developing new scales or refining the old service quality scales to 
suit the e-channels of service delivery. The SERVQUAL and related scales were refined and scales like E-SQ, E-
SQual-ERec-SQual were established for measuring electronic service quality in today’s technology based era of 
service delivery.  This paper aims to study the evolution of e-service quality and describes the transition of service 
quality to e-service quality. 
Keywords 
Service Quality, E-service Quality, Information technology, SERVQUAL, E-SQual-ERec-SQual 
1. Introduction:
Service quality first attracted attention when services increasingly gained importance in the developed economies after 
1960 (Juran and Godfrey, 1999). It began with the inclusion of the services around the product in the definition of the 
traditional product quality. Johnson et al. (1972) and Buffa (1976) gave the first two texts that emphasized the 
importance of the service operations in the services sector. Services hence gained much importance in that era. 
Services have been described by various well known scholars. Gronroos (2000), finds service to be a “process 
consisting of a series of more or less intangible activities that normally, but not necessarily always, take place in 
interactions between the customer and service employees and/or physical resources or goods and/or systems of the 
service provider, which are provided as solutions to customer problems.” 
The differentiation between services and physical goods exists in many aspects, including intangibility and 
heterogeneity of services, inability of services to be stocked and transferred in terms of ownership, the production, 
distribution and consumption of services occurring simultaneously, services being produced in buyer-seller 
interactions and  having the participation of customers in the process of their production. The last one being most 
crucial with regards to service quality as the perceived service quality of customers results from their interaction with 
the service production process. Hence, measuring the service quality has been challenging for the service providing 
organizations. Service quality is determined by perceptions and expectations (Parasuraman et ah, 1985, 1988; Lewis 
and Mitchell, 1990). The early 1980’s witnessed a high interest and enthusiasm in services, and the major recognition 
of the services sector was the pioneering work by Parasuraman et al. (1985). This period was followed by more testing 
of ideas regarding service quality which resulted in models like the ones proposed by Cronin and Taylor 1992, Mattson 
1992, Teas 1993 etc. 
2. Why e-SQ:
Since electronic commerce began to proliferate all over the world, companies globally started to understand the 
importance of their presence on the electronic platforms of marketing in order to stay relevant and gain competitive 
edge in the technologically dominating era of markets and marketing. These organizations tried to increase their web 
presence and deliver their products and services through electronic channels and communicate more through the web

Abstract 
This paper aims to identify and structure challenges and opportunities for improving Indonesian blood supply chain 
management. Nowadays, Indonesian blood supply chain is operated by using a decentralization approach. Blood bank 
is one of the echelons in blood supply chain. A Blood Transfusion Unit (BTU) is a blood bank organized by the 
Indonesian Red Cross (IRC). An exploratory approach is used to collect empirical evidence in Indonesian blood supply 
chain. Furthermore, SWOT method is employed to map the identified problems and the improvement opportunities. 
This research conclude that the main problems in the blood supply chains emerged at the level of the BTU. Many 
BTUs experienced a high risk of having expired products as well as inventory shortages. The possible causes of those 
issues are high supply uncertainty, high demand uncertainty, and perishable characteristics of blood bag product. The 
three factors become challenges faced by BTU of IRC. The solution proposed for the BTU to overcome this challenge 
is to initiate collaborative actions among the BTUs. This collaboration should be conducted in planning process at 
operational level. Therefore, the future work is to build collaboration models for improving the blood management 
system, which consider the uniqueness of social demographic of Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Blood management is a highly important issue that has been a center of attention in many countries, because blood is 
a vital constituent of human body and it is difficult to find its alternatives (Kumar & Rai, 2015). Blood supply chain 
management (BSCM) has long interrelated sequences, which consist of collecting, producing, maintaining the 
inventory, and distributing processes to the patients in need (Osorio et al., 2015). It is very urgent to control BSCM 
accurately because blood and is perishable, which means that it has limited life cycle, and it needs a tight security 
regulation (Mansur et al., 2018) and this paper try to uncover challenges in Indonesia’s BSCM. The effectiveness of 
BSCM system is expected to optimize the blood stock quantity on a secure level or on the intended service level, 
whose condition can be shown in the conformity between supply and demand, also the sufficient quality level and 
cost affordability. To create a reliable BSCM, a precise planning system is required, which takes into account all the 
resources and service target provided by stakeholders (Ghandforoush, & Sen, 2010). Therefore, good coordination 
among stakeholders is needed to achieve effective and efficient BSCM performance (Stanger, 2013).

1. Improving the awareness of each BTU about vision and mission in delivering excellent service. 
2. Building mutual trust among BTUs to support information sharing. 
3. Designing appropriate collaboration strategy to gain optimum inventory performance. 
4. Conducting evaluation and corrective action from the applied collaboration strategy.  
 
 
5. Conclusion 
Blood management system in Indonesia, which is handled by the BTUs, follows a decentralization model. It needs 
some improvements especially in managing the inventory system. The special challenges to be solved are overcoming 
the stock out and expired products. Collaboration among the BTUs can be used as an alternative to improve the 
management, particularly in planning and operational stages. Nowadays, there are still several constraints in 
implementing the collaboration, both technical and non-technical. Steps that need to be done in building collaboration 
between BTUs are building awareness about business risks, building trust between BTUs, designing collaboration 
systems, and evaluating systems to make improvements. Further research is expected to build a flexible collaboration 
model among the BTUs in order to commit to the obligations as individual organization as well as improve 
collaboration. The simulation approach may help to design collaboration model to accommodate the complexity of 
blood management problems.

New Valid Inequalities for Capacitated Plant Location 
Problem

Abstract 
With the contribution of Sharma and Muralidhar (2009) to problem Simple Plant Location Problem (SPLP), we 
now have two weak formulations and a strong formulation SPLP. It is noted that the total number of constraints 
in the weak formulation is linear, whereas the number of constraints in the strong formulation go quadratic. 
Though relaxed weak formulations give the inferior bound but their computational time is much less compared 
to the relaxed strong formulation of SPLP. Many researchers observed that this computational advantage of the 
weak formulation is significant for smaller sized problems however for large sized problems bound provided by 
it is poor. Hence hybrid formulations are proposed by many. We propose the similar model for capacitated plant 
location problem (CPLP). We modify the Sharma and Muralidhar (2009) weak formulations and add to them 
only the most promising strong constraints to have advantages of both. Here in this paper, we also introduce an 
additional constraint that the number of plants located is less than some number ‘n’ or greater than ‘n+1’and 
hope that this will lead to significantly better LP relaxation bounds (we hope that this improvement will be 
dependent on the value of ‘n’). Two criteria for computing ‘n (n1 and n2)’ are also explored. We further modify 
the formulation by adding one more constraint based on the assumption of opening up all plants to have bound 
based on simple transportation problem. This is also done with the hope of getting better bounds without 
causing significant computational complexity addition. 
Key Word: CPLP, Weak Formulation, Strong Formulation

Introduction
Plant/facility location is a vital decision in determining a geographical site for the operation of any 
manufacturing or service industry. It is a complex process including tangible and intangible factors. The 
intangible factors vary from one site to another and therefore hard to measure whereas the tangible factors like 
construction cost, labor cost, availability of raw materials, proximity to market and suppliers, market demand, 
etc. can be found. In literature, the tangible cost can be divided into two categories. First, the location-specific 
fixed cost and the second being the transportation cost. This problem when further constrained by the production 
capacity of the plant is defined as capacitated plant location problem (CPLP). Like in an automobile 
manufacturing unit, the product of cycle time and some active assembly lines determines the capacity of that 
unit. The CPLP is a well-studied optimization problem belonging to the class of the NP-Hard problems for 
which a variety of heuristic, meta-heuristic approaches are available in the literature. We provide different 
formulations to compare the efficacy of the constraints that give superior LP relaxation.

Then another strong formulation can be, 
Minimize (1); subject to (2) to (15)  
 
Again to this one can also add 5(a) for further beneficial result.  
 
Finally we do the following addition to strong constraints:  
 
Take 'is', such that 𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖/𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 is smallest, and add to a set say PO (plant open). Keep doing it until for 'i' belonging 
to PO, it has sum of included CAPi just greater than or equal to 1 . Compute     𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹2 = ∑
𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖∊𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃
, and add the 
following constraint  
  
∑fi
𝑖𝑖
∗𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖≥𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹2                                           
 
………... (16) 
 
Let the associated TrC (with (16)) be min_TrC2; then along the lines of (15) we give the following constraint:  
 
∑
 ( 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) <= min _𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇2
𝑖𝑖,𝑘𝑘
                                                            ………….. (17) 
 
We can use Singh and Sharma algorithm (2008) to get a good solution to this problem (say SPS*) and put an 
additional constraint (18) to get a good solution.              
     
obj fn value 𝑍𝑍 <= 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ∗                                                                                   … … … …. (18) 
 
3. Discussion 
 
It is noted that various inequalities for the problem CPLP (as developed in this paper) are linear; And are 
expected to boost the LP relaxation bounds in a Branch and bound solution procedure. In particular, we plan to 
solve three formulations for each problem set, CPLP-weak, CPLP-strong, and CPLP- weak plus most promising 
strong plus various other inequalities given in this paper 
 
 We are undertaking an empirical investigation that plans to determine the relative efficacy of different 
constraints that give superior LP relaxations.

Abstract 
This work explores how a photovoltaic (PV) system, can further contribute to worldwide efforts to reduce energy cost and 
environmental concerns by providing an overview of energy management analysis. Additionally, it illustrates the economic 
impact of installing the proposed PV system for a selected data center in Dubai, UAE. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming 
optimization model has been proposed that uses the output of the PV panels. The proposed model minimizes cost by optimizing 
the PV system size, so that the required electrical load is satisfied while minimizing the cost of purchased electrical energy from 
the utility grid. In this model, the system efficiency, the government incentives, the potential rebates, the inflation in electricity 
prices, the interest rates, the system salvage value and the electricity tariffs have been considered. A cases study is conducted in 
which the optimal solution does not recommend using the PV system with the current electricity prices. Sensitivity analyses have 
shown that changing the system cost to zero, i.e. offering it for free to the users by the governements, or the government may 
increase the energy costs from 0.57 [AED/KWh] to 1.1 [AED/KWh] through the imposition of taxes, this result in recommending 
installing the PV system.

1. Introduction
It is becoming extremely critical to manage energy consumption at all premises for the purpose of reducing costs and
environmental impacts (Al-Salaymeh et al. 2010). It is well-known that using fossil fuels, such as oil and gas in power generation 
plants creates many environmental issues, mainly due to their emission of polluting greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere.  
 
Energy production and consumption due to the increased economic progress of developing countries has increased dramatically 
in the last few decades. It is expected to increase by 65% in 2040, reflecting the growing prosperity and the expanding economies 
of such areas, while global energy demand will grow about 35% due to the world population expansion (Bortolini et al. 2014). This 
increase has a huge impact on both the economy and global warming caused by CO2 and other GHG emissions.

5. Conclusion 
 
An optimization approach has been proposed to equip decision makers with the available and feasible options for 
switching over to energy efficient photovoltaic system installations that can satisfy the ever-growing demand for electricity. Lingo 
15.0 optimization software was utilized in this work to solve the optimization model. 
An optimization model has been presented considering monthly average values of the load to be supplied, average output 
energy from the PV panels based on average peak sun hours for the UAE. Based on actual values of the parameters of this model 
from the case study, the PV system installation is not recommended unless the land rent cost drops to 30% of its actual cost or the 
purchased/sold energy prices increases to 1.1 [AED/KWh] from their actual values of 0.57 [AED/KWh]. The impact of this work 
will target the consumers toward renewable energy source for generating electricity rather than conventional use of burning fossil 
fuel and its impact on commercial and environmental impact. This work can be used for future study related to case by case 
implementation in residential properties i.e. implementation of optimized PV system for Villas in UAE.

Abstract 
In the Philippines, media broadcasting provides quality television production shows which includes game shows, 
variety shows, talk shows, television journalism, musicals, soap operas, and many others which utilizes different 
setting up techniques and methodologies on preparing the entirety of the production set. In this production setup, 
lights, audio, and broadcast team comprises the three major production teams. All production setups differ from one 
another because of different requirements for every production shows, resulting to unstandardized setup times. This 
study aims to optimize the remote production setup of a media broadcasting company in accordance to engineering 
standards and with consideration of trade-offs that is based on applicable constraints such as Material VA/VE, 
Product VA/VE, Process VA/VE, Ergonomics, Economic, and Productivity. There are two design options and Based 
on the over-all rankings of constraints, the second alternative design or the “Workstation with Flip-Up Monitor 
Rack”. yielded a rank of 5 for Material VA/VE, 3.37 for Product VA/VE, 1.5323 for Process VA/VE, 4 for 
Ergonomics, 3 for Economic, and a governing rank of 5 for the Productivity constraint with an average overall rank 
of 3.65

1. Introduction
Media Broadcasting companies make a large portion of their profits from advertisements. It is undergoing enormous 
changes with technology introducing new delivery opportunities and thereby more broadcasters into the 
equation. Past studies shows the recent wave as well as the implications of mergers and acquisitions both vertical 
and horizontal in TV broadcasting and Distribution Company, furthermore, it seeks to put a better perspective on the 
guideline of Mergers and Acquisitions in the TV industry. (Evens, T. and Donders, K. (2016).  In the Philippines, 
media broadcasting was pioneered by the oldest broadcast commercial television network named Company X, The 
flagship of the network is their quality television production shows. It includes collection of game shows, variety 
shows, talk shows, television journalism, musicals, soap operas, and others to mention. Considering the 
aforementioned collection of different television production that they have, the company also utilizes different 
setting-up techniques and methodologies on preparing the entirety of the production set. The set-up is usually done 
by the three major production teams namely, lights, audio, and broadcast team. The set-up methodology of one 
production usually varies from the other because of different studio layout and design for a particular production. 
That is why the set-up time of the shows not the same with each other are. The set-up time may be affected by the 
studio area depending on the show they will be taping, or if they will opt to do the taping outside the studio. Because 
of the varying techniques and demand of the different types of production, no particular standard is established 
regarding the time it takes to set up the studio or the standard facility layout and design to optimize the set-up

4.7 Trade-Offs 
 
The constraint evaluations are summarized and ranked according to the level of importance using a formula from the 
Model on Trade-Off Strategies in Engineering Design by Kevin N. Otto and Erik K. Antonsson (1991) for the 
quantitative scaling of constraints. The importance of each criterion (on a scale of 0 to 5, as 5 being the highest 
importance) was assigned, and each design methodology’s ability to satisfy the criterion (on a scale of 0 to 5, as 5 
being the highest ability to satisfy the criterion) was also tabulated. On the other hand, this study set the governing 
rank for each criterion involved and was based on the initial research and analysis made for the design. 
 
The computation of ranking ability to satisfy the criteria of the design proposal is as follows:

The governing rank is the subjective choice of this study. Assigning the value for each criterion’s importance was 
also based on the subjective judgment. The subordinate rank (Equation 2) is a variable that corresponds to its 
percentage (%) distance from the governing rank along the ranking scale.   
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
Table 5.1 shows the comparison of decision criteria (also known as trade-offs) that have been to compare each 
design versus one another. This is a main advantage in choosing the best design that would cater the needs and the 
requirements of Company X remote set-up. Material VA/VE covers the consideration of the proponents to the 
strength of the material used for the table top and side panels. Design 2 obtained the governing rank of 5 as it has the 
strongest type of material used. For the Product VA/VE which considers the total weight of the constructed table, 
design 1 obtained the governing rank of 5 being the lightest among the three designs. Under the Process VA/VE 
which considers the number of hours required to fabricate the product, design 3 got the governing rank of 2 having 
the least number of hours for fabrication. Ergonomics consideration on the other hand determines the ergonomic 
compliance of each designs. Under this consideration, design 3 won the tradeoffs being the most ergonomically 
designed. Design 2 gained the governing rank of 3 under the economic constraint. And lastly, the table that requires 
the least set-up time emerged to be design 2 which obtained the governing rank of 5.

Abstract 
Plant location is a crucial decision in meeting the customer demand efficiently and effectively. The researchers 
have given different formulations for solving this optimization problem and such problems are NP Hard due to 
various integer variables and non linear formulation. Sharma and Muralidhar (2009) approach to model relaxed 
Simple Plant Location Problem (SPLP) resulted in two weak formulations and a strong formulation. It is found 
that weak formulations give an inferior bound compared to strong formulation but their computational time is 
comparatively very less. The reason being the constraints in strong formulations go quadratic in number. It has 
been observed by many that for smaller sized problems, the weak formulation of SPLP is superior to Strong 
formulation of SPLP in terms of computational time. Here hybrid formulations are proposed to accommodate 
benefits of both the formulations. We take full weak formulation (either weak one or weak two) and add to it 
only the most promising strong constraints. It is claimed that this approach (hybrid) is better than weak and 
strong formulation of SPLP in terms of upper bound and computational time. We also provide additional strong 
constraints based on various transportation and location costs assumptions that can improve the relaxed 
solutions of the SPLP.

Introduction
In supply chain network planning a key decision is to determine the set of potential sites for the location of 
plants/facilities. The objective of the facility location problem is to determine sufficient number of facilities 
(such as plants, warehouse, fire station etc.) in order to minimize the total cost. This problem deals with the 
locating the plants with unlimited capacities to serve certain markets demand (also known as simple plant 
location problem (SPLP)). The costs involved in meeting the customer demands include the fixed costs of 
setting up plants, and the transportation cost of supplying customers from these plants to the demand 
destinations. SPLP is well studied in literature and is considered to be the NP Hard problem. Literature discusses 
various exact and heuristic techniques for solving. Here we provide different formulations that compare the 
efficiency of various modified constraints to find the formulation that gives the best non-integer/relaxed 
solution.

Variable Definition:

Let ‘n’ be the estimated maximum number of plants that must be opened for problem SPLP (determined by 
heuristic given by Sharma and Jha (2018) that compares the ratio of transportation and fixed costs). In the case 
when transportation cost is a much smaller number (compared to other costs such as location cost), then ‘n’ will 
be smaller (and vice-versa)). This is achieved by following constraints by adding one more binary variable ‘z’. 
 
∑𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖− 𝑀𝑀∗  𝑧𝑧≤ 𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖
                                                ∀ 𝑖𝑖                                    ..………  (9) 
∑𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖+  𝑀𝑀∗(1 − 𝑧𝑧) ≥(𝑛𝑛
𝑖𝑖
+ 1 )                          ∀ 𝑖𝑖                                     ..……… (10) 
Where z is the binary variable.  
 
Then, we have another strong formulation as 
 
Minimize (1); subject to constraints (2) to (4), and (6) to (10) 
 
We note that constraints will be more effective when we have tailor made implicit enumeration procedure (due 
to Erlenkotter); and also note standard solvers do not give users that kind of flexibility.  
 
To this one can also add 5(a) for beneficial result.  
 
Formulation 4: Determination of lowest transportation cost (min_TrC) and adding related constraint  
 
Let min_TrC = Minimum transportation cost, when plants are opened at all possible locations 
 
Then a constraint can be added to the formulation such as, 
 
∑
( 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ∗ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) > min _𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇
𝑖𝑖,𝑘𝑘
                                                                  … … . . ..……… (11) 
 
 
In above, compute ∑fi
𝑖𝑖
= 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹1, wherever there is positive outflow from an ‘i’.  
 
Then we add following ∑fi
𝑖𝑖
∗𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖≤𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹1                                                            ………….. (12) 
 
Hence we have another strong formulation as 
 
Minimize (1); subject to constraints (2)-(4), (6) to (8), (11) and (12).  
 
We note that to this constraint (5a) can be added, again for fruitful results.  
 
It is advised to use Singh and Sharma algorithm (2008) to get a good solution to this problem (say SPS*) and put 
an additional constraint (13) as bound on objective function value Z, to get a good solution.              
 
𝑍𝑍 <= 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ∗                                                                                          ……………… (13) 
 
3. 
Conclusion 
 
Here in this paper we introduce an additional constraint that number of plants to be  located is less than some 
number ‘n’ or greater than ‘n+1’ based on contribution of transportation or fixed location cost in total objective 
function.  We hope that this will lead to significantly better LP relaxation bounds. We also provide an additional 
constraint based on minimization of transportation cost (min_TrC) under the assumption all plant locations are 
utilized. This accommodated in formulation of SPLP will speed up computational performance. 
 
Here we wish to compare weak formulation of SPLP (constraint (2) to (4), & (6) to (8); excluding constraint (5)) 
with various strong formulations of SPLP (constraint (2) to (4), (5a) & (6) to (13)). It is to be noted that all 
constraints are linear in nature and therefore we expect significantly better LP relaxation bounds without 
significant increment in the complexity.

Abstract— It is widely known that the degradation of waste activated sludge is a slow process with a low extent of 
degradation. Improvement methods with regards to bio-methane yield were investigated in this study using a laboratory batch 
anaerobic digester. Mono-digestion of sludge with a C: N ratio of 15.47 resulted in a lower accumulation of gas volume than 
co-digested sludge even though the pH decreased rapidly in both cases. The thermophillic anaerobic digestion of sludge and 
co-digested sludge also produced higher bio-methane yield than mesophillic digestion of waste water sludge. Gas 
accumulation volume in the digesters during thermophillic digestion increased from 50 Nml to 100 Nml, 200 Nml to 600 
Nml and 600 Nml to 750 Nml for sludge, cow dung and sludge and sludge and food waste respectively as the temperature 
was increased from 37oC to 45oC.

1 Introduction 
South Africa and certain Eskom supplied countries in Africa are currently going through an energy crisis. The process of load 
shedding and the promoted energy efficiency programmes serves to illustrate the current energy situation.  Furthermore, the 
situation is aggravated by the increases in energy prices. South Africa is becoming one of the higher costing energy suppliers 
in the world. Additionally, South Africa is one of the highest GHG emitters in the world therefore all efforts must be made in 
order to reduce its GHG emissions. Treating sewage is a water recycling service. A large variety of disposal routes are 
possible, however anaerobic digestion proves to be more eminent for its abilities to further transform organic matter into 
biogas (60–70 volume% of methane, CH4), which can then be used to generate electricity or used as it is (Gunaseelan, 1997).

Figure 5: Influence of digestion temperature on the bio-methane production 
 
The Figure 5 show mono-digestion and co-digestion of sludge. Higher biogas production was observed under thermophilic 
temperature compared to mesophilic condition with lower retention time. There were more mesophiles than thermophiles; 
they are also more resilient to changes in the conditions of their environment in comparison to the thermophiles. Therefore, 
mesophilic digestion and systems are considered to have more stability than thermophillic systems. On the contrary, even 
though thermophillic digestion systems are said to be less stable, they have a higher methane yield. Since their heat energy 
input is higher which allows for removal of biogas from the substrate at a retention time that is the same as that of a 
mesophillic system. Furthermore, it is known that high temperature results in fast movement of molecules which then results 
in a fast rate of reaction and thus faster gas production. Another advantage is that the high temperature facilitates greater 
reduction in pathogens in the digestate. 
 
4 Conclusion 
Anaerobic digestion of a substrate conducted under thermophilic temperature resulted in a higher bio-methane yield than 
mesophilic range with lower retention time. Therefore, thermophilic can be used as an alternative to mesophilic temperature, 
although the drawback would be the costs involved in the energy input that comes with a higher temperature. The co-
digestion of the substrate enhanced increased in biogas production than the mono-digestion with control of pH and 
distribution of the nutrients.

Abstract - In this study, we compared methane production by anaerobic mono-digestion and co-digestion of cow 
dung, chicken manure and pig manure under mesophilic conditions at the temperature of 37 0C using a ratio of 1:1. 
C/N ratio, pH, VS/TS and sulphur content were the parameters investigated. Results indicated that co-digesting of 
cow dung; pig manure and chicken manure enhanced biogas production and methane content.  The results also imply 
that pig manure cannot be used alone to produce methane as it produced low methane. Chicken manure produced 
more on the first day (272 Nml) compared to pig manure (257.4 Nml) and cow dung (80.5 Nml). On the ninth day, 
chicken produced 884 .9 Nml and then on the tenth day it went up again to 1095.6 Nml, reached its peak on day 13 
and stopped, chicken yielded better results compared to the cow dung and pig manure because chicken had a higher 
VS/TS percent which is desirable for methane production. Pig manure started producing methane on the first day 
which was 257.4 Nml and stopped on the second day with the volume of 262.3 Nml. Pig manure showed poor results 
compared to cow dung and chicken manure.

1. Introduction
The use of energy is of importance in the development of the society to control and adapt to the environment. In the 
industrialized world the development of energy resources has become essential for agriculture, transportation, waste 
collection, information technology, communications that have become prerequisites of a developed society. The 
increasing use of energy since the industrial revolution has also brought with it a number of serious problems, some 
of which, such as global warming, present potentially serious risks to the world.

Figure 4: Effect of co-digestion in biomethane production 
Figure 4. Showed the effect of co-digestion in methane production. Cow dung, chicken manure and pig manure were 
co-digested using the ratio of 1:1 under mesophillic condition in AD. Co-digestion results were very higher than that 
of mono digestion of the three substrates which resulted in co-digestion producing more methane biogas compared to 
mono digestion. According to Mata-Alvarez et al., (2000), co-digestion of animal manure with biomass was better 
than mono-digestion as it produced higher methane due to the synergistic effects of the co-substrates.  The advantages 
of co-digestion of animal manure: buffering capacity increases and the accumulation of volatile fatty acids during 
digestion was possible (Campos et al., 1999), (Brummeler and Koster, 1990); it can avoid high concentrations and 
produces required pH for methanogenesis stage, high concentration of NH3 can be avoided; it can also provide the 
required C: N ratios by the methanogens (Angelidaki and Ahring, 1997). 
 
4. Conclusion 
This study evaluated the methane production from cow dung, chicken manure and pig manure. It showed that 
mono-digestion and co-digestion of cow dung, chicken manure and pig manure enhanced biogas production and 
methane content under mesophilic condition (37 0C). The results indicated that there was substantial methane 
production potential from chicken manure and cow dung. Chicken produced the best methane production compared 
to the other two wastes. Pig manure indicated poor results in producing methane. When mono-digestion and co-
digestion were compared, co-digestion was better than mono-digestion. The result for co-digestion of cow dung, 
chicken manure and pig manure yielded higher biomethane, biogas accumulation and a higher methane content than 
that of mono-digestion.

Abstract 
Process improvement among industries results to increased worker efficiency as most labor enterprises utilize the 
improvement of each process done in the garments production. Productivity can be obtained through utilization of 
the available resources, a factor to speed production of goods. In this study, workers experienced delays on the 
sewing process of square pants garments due to inefficient worker production and the absence of time standards. 
These problems cause 12.62% of idle time and 5.08% unnecessary motions encountered in the production incurring 
Php 63,600.00 total income loss per month. Through work sampling, creating a production standard could serve as a 
basis for the worker performance in eliminating the unnecessary hand and body improvements which workers’ 
performance can significantly improve to 19.05% in the workers’ productivity. Recommendations such as 
implement strict company rules, improvement in the production floor layout, rewards and incentives, provide 
trainings among workers, and new time standardizations can expectedly improve the whole sewing process by at 
least 15-20%.

1. Introduction
One of the world’s largest trades is the garments and apparel industry, with most items being produced out of 
developing countries. In the Philippines, garments and apparel started as a small industry in the 1950s. Bolstered by 
skilled and educated workers, innate creativity and favorable legislation, the industry grew rapidly in the intervening 
decades until it peaked in the 1990s . In 2012, market demand on the Philippines clothing market was approximately 
7.1 billion U.S. dollars. The apparel and textile industries have always been constantly changing, in line with new 
fashion trends. And because of this, problems may occur at some of the business aspects such as inventories, 
demands and forecast of sales. Advancement in technology during 1980s resulted to a new trend called the lean 
retailing. This led the researchers to the realization that this industry might be one of the possible career choices so it 
would be a great help if the researchers can learn about its works, the production, and what innovation can the 
researchers give to the fashion world. 
The main problem of most companies is the lack of time standardization of the operation process that lowers the 
productivity of the workers thus, slows down the production and result to High Operating Cost. This research aims 
to establish time standards to minimize the idle time and unnecessary motions such as excessive chit chatting, use of 
phones, reaching excessive distances when taking components and tools and then eventually reduce the cost of 
operations.

5. Conclusion 
 
The researchers were able to address the existing problems which are extension of working hours, idle time and 
unnecessary motions through setting time standards in each process of operation. The researchers were able to 
establish a much suitable working area by proposing a better floor plan that will result in maximizing the available 
space that later on affects the increase in the productivity of the workers. The researchers were able to reduce the 3 
additional working hours to only 1 by increasing the productivity of each worker by cutting down the idle time and 
unnecessary motions such as chit-chatting, phone usage, waiting for next batch and procrastination. Based on the 
results, the proposed method has a 19.05% increase in the productivity and 26.46% decrease of the time of 
operation. It also shows that the new layout has a 9.60% decrease for the distances of each station. The researchers 
were able to reduce the operating cost from Php 259,598.88 to Php 227108.88 which shows a 12.52% or Php 
32,490.00 less from the previous expense, this result to an increase from Php 160,401.12 to Php 192, 891.0 with a 
20.26% or Php 32,490.00 additional for the company’s profit. Lastly, the researchers also conclude that it is more 
economical to have additional working hours even with their present productivity than to hire more workers based 
since they will only need an hour of additional work. 
 
6. Recommendation 
 
6.1 Controls 
 
To lessen the laziness and tardiness, the company should strictly implement the rules and regulations such as salary 
deduction for late comers and absentees. The researchers also recommended updating their house rules such as 
giving warnings, memorandum and stern sanctions but still in compliance with the labor code in order to avoid 
encouraging the employees to misbehave. For increasing the productivity the company should prohibit phone usage, 
too much chit chatting and other unnecessary things whilst outside break schedules. To avoid unorganized work 
station and production floor the company should provide proper storage for personal things and work related 
supplies. To benefit the workers, the researchers proposed to the company to give rewards and incentives to aid the 
lost over time pay of the workers due to the new time standards. Aside from this overtime pay, holiday pay, 13th 
month pay and other bonuses should be given to the workers to increase morale and satisfaction. The researchers 
also suggested having the workers trained to learn basic troubleshooting of sewing machines to avoid unwanted 
delays in the production. 
 
6.2 Future Study 
 
Future researchers can work on moving the storage area closer to the stairs to lessen time distance travelled. Data 
from this research paper can be used for future study about the expansion of the company. Future researchers can 
also work on proposing safety measures for the company such as fire exits, fire extinguishers, fire alarm, smoke 
detectors, sprinklers and others.

Abstract 
The decline in sales achievement by Matahari Department Store Tunjungan Plaza Surabaya was become a concern 
problem in the company. Following the decline in employee performance because of inharmonious and 
uncomfortable organizational culture, lack of motivation and employee competencies. The purpose of this study 
is to analyze the significant and partial effect between organizational culture, work motivation and competence 
on employee performance in Matahari Department Store Tunjungan Plaza Surabaya. This study uses a quantitative 
approach and the correlation research method with sampling techniques using ""purposive sampling"", the sample 
in this study reach to 70 people from a population of 1040 skilled employees. The results of the F test was 
concluded that organizational culture, work motivation and competence had a significant effect on employee 
performance simultaneously. This means that by increasing the variables of organizational culture, work 
motivation and competence will improve employee performance. The results on the t-test was concluded that 
organizational culture and work motivation have a significant partial effect on employee performance, while 
competence does not have a significant partial effect on employee performance. Companies can build a conducive 
work culture and create solid teamwork to create productive employees. To stimulate employees to be more 
innovative and have new ideas for the development of the company, they must implement continuous education 
and training to improve employee competencies.

The authors investigate the impact of e-satisfaction and e-trust on online repurchase intention in the 
context of electronic commerce. Partial least square was used to analyze the direct and indirect effect of e-
satisfaction and e-trust on online repurchase intention. Findings of this research indicate that e-satisfaction 
affects online repurchase intention. Consistent with the expectation, e-trust has an impact on online 
repurchase intention. In addition, the results of the indirect analyses support the mediating effect of e-
satisfaction and e-trust on online repurchase intention through e-loyalty. The findings have important 
implications, suggesting that the higher the level of e-satisfaction and e-trust, the higher the level of e-
loyalty. Moreover, the electronic commerce firm efforts to enhance e-satisfaction and e-trust may actually 
increase customer online repurchase intention.

The Effects of Chromosome Length on Hyper-Heuristics for 
Solving the Maritime Inventory Routing Problems

Abstract 
This paper describes the effects of chromosome length for solving maritime inventory routing problems (MIRP) by 
using a hyper-heuristics based Genetic Algorithm (GA). The approach uses a set of heuristic combinations, each of 
which consist of strategies that correspond to a ship assignment. These strategies are represented by a chromosome 
that may have several assignments. We examine several number of chromosome length to encourage the evolution of 
good heuristics combinations. Moreover, a variation of several number chromosome length is necessary since we do 
not know in advance how many ship assignments are needed to cover demands during a predefined planning horizon. 
At every iteration a number of chromosomes are evaluated and evolved within a GA framework. In this study, the 
approach has been applied on several test cases for transporting multiple oil products from a production facility to 
some consumption ports, by using several heterogeneous ships with undedicated compartments. The results show that 
a hyper-heuristics based GA reaches the same global optimal as the solutions in the mathematical model, but with a 
significant decrease in computational time. Moreover, the use two numbers of chromosome length proves that three 
assignments in one step (3AiOS) mostly got better solutions and lower minimum total number of assignments than 
the two assignments (2AiOS).

1. Introduction
Maritime inventory routing problem (mIRP) can be defined as an inventory routing problem (IRP) that uses ships to 
distribute product(s). Many papers have discussed this problem, for example the model considered in Christiansen, 
and Nygreen (1998a and 1998b), Christiansen (1999), Hwang (2005) and Al-Khayyal and Hwang (2007). The first 
three papers considers a single product model, while the last two extends the problem to have multiple non-
intermixable products. An extensive survey on maritime scheduling research is provided in Christiansen et al. (2007) 
and Christiansen and Fagerholt (2008).  
Several papers show a real world application of mIRP, such as Christiansen et al. (2011), Furman et al. (2011) and 
Song and Furman (2013). The first paper discusses the distribution of multiple grade cements from two production 
ports to 28 consumption ports in Norway. In this problem, the delivery of a ship is limited to a pair of one production 
and one consumption port. They developed a method that consists of two components: a heuristic construction and a 
genetic algorithm to solve the problem. While the last two papers discussed the same problem, transporting a single 
vacuum gas oil (VGO) product from several production ports in Europe to refineries in the United States. In this 
problem, the ships may pick-up the product at multiple nodes before distributing it to the several ports. They use a 
method that consists of a large neighbourhood search and a branch-and-cut algorithm for solving this problem.  
This paper also discusses a mIRP that delivers multiple products from a production port to several ports. The problem 
is similar to the model discussed in Christiansen et al. (2011). The similarities are multi-intermixable products, the 
undedicated compartments that need an algorithm to assign products into compartments and the continuous time 
model. However, in our model we assumed that the ships may visit up to two ports in one assignment, instead of one

4. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we show that a Hyper-Heuristics based GA reaches the same global optimal as the solutions in the 
mathematical model for solving shorter planning horizon (i.e. 10 and 15 day planning horizon), but with a significant 
decrease in computational time. We also demonstrated the use adaptive length chromosome to solve longer planning 
horizon. In this method, three assignments in one step (3AiOS--) mostly get better solutions and lower minimum total 
number of assignments than the two assignments (2AiOS--). However, they cost longer running time. These successful 
results indicates that the method can be applied to larger test problems (i.e. longer planning horizon or modeling more 
ports, ships or/and products to be served). Moreover, the flexibility to add strategies means the method can be further 
extended to adapt to the various features of the problems.

Abstract 
Instagram as one of the most active social media platform in Indonesia has made businesses to use it as one of their 
marketing strategies. Recognizing users’ motivation to be active in Instagram enables digital retailers to optimize 
this platform to market their products. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship among the shopping, 
utilitarian and hedonic motivation on consumers’ intention to search the information or to do shopping on Instagram. 
This study involved 128 Instagram users aged 17-45 years old. An online questionnaire was used as the data 
collection, then it was analyzed using SEM-PLS. The result shows that hedonic motivation does not motivate the 
consumers to search the information on Instagram. Moreover, utilitarian motivation and search information are not 
as a predictor of online purchasing. Considering the platform chosen is able to influence the information search 
intention and purchasing, thus this study paves the way on how an individual having interaction through social 
media, especially Instagram.

Utilitarian motivation, hedonic motivation, search intention, purchases intention, Instagram 
1. Introduction
Social media has drawn attention to marketer as an effective communication media to interact with the consumers 
(Anderson, Knight, Pookulangara, & Josiam, 2014; Fatanti & Suyadnya, 2015). Low-cost expense and large scale 
are the main reasons behind this. One of fast-growing social media globally is Instagram, which enables its users to 
upload a photo or video as well as to share it on the other platform (Business Insider, 2010; Instagram, 2016; 
Wagner, 2015). Instagram is the first social network application designed for mobile device (Miles, 2013). 
Instagram has been a popular marketing media, not only because of the growing number of its users, but also 
because of its characteristics that emphasize visual content rather than text (Neher, 2013). Instagram, which at first, 
is used for entertainment and interaction, nowadays, it is also used for business’ needs (Alghamdi & Reilly, 2013; 
Miles, 2013). 
Nowadays, Indonesia has become a country with Instagram users in the Asia Pacific with the monthly active user 
(MAU) is 1 billion per June 2018 (Bohang, 2017, 2018). Some popular brands (such as AirAsia, Intel, Lazada,

Abstract 
The International Air Transportation Association (IATA), predicts the strength of the air transportation industry 
in Indonesia, with a population of more than 250 million people, by 2035 it will reach more than 310 million 
passengers, and provide 8.8 million jobs, increasing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to US $ 99 billion. In 2015, 
Indonesia was ranked 9th in the world, for the number of air transport passengers, it increased by more than 10 
thousand passengers in 4 years. In the next 10 years (2027) Indonesia will be ranked 6th in the world number of 
air transport passengers, but Indonesia, along with China and India, is currently a country with a low frequency 
of flights compared to the high population. The airport is designated as an international airport by considering: 
(1) the national airport master plan; (2) Defense and security of the state; (3) Growth and development of tourism;
(4) The interests and capabilities of national air transport; (5) National economic development and foreign trade.
Based on the multiple linear regression equation, the aircraft departs variable and departing passengers, have a
positive impact on increasing the Regional Budget (APBD).

Abstract 
Road damage is often one of the causes of accidents. Road damage is a lot of damaged factors which cause 
overloading of vehicles and changes in weather (rain). Almost half of the road surface in Indonesia is 
flexible pavement. Flexible pavement made of asphalt is easily damaged. The limitation of providing 
asphalt as a component of the main material has become a separate obstacle. One step that can be done is 
to test plastic waste material (LDPE) as a mixture of asphalt. The purpose of this research is to find out the 
most ideal cost in making plastic asphalt. Research method in the form of experiments by means of 
experiments in the laboratory to obtain the desired plastic composition. The optimum composition and 
content of asphalt are used with the addition of percentage variations of 6, 7, and 8% of LDPE (low density 
polyethylene) type plastic waste in hot asphalt mixtures for AC-WC (asphalt concrete wearing coarse) 
layers. Wear layer which must be fulfilled by the special hot interim mix asphalt specification standard

Abstract 
The purpose of the study is to find the various characters that are owned by the young generation in 
Surabaya, Indonesia, in relation to the desire for entrepreneurship which has a large number of employment 
opportunities for the millennia generation. Entrepreneurship is the solution to a large workforce and limited 
employment opportunities in Indonesia. Entrepreneurial character makes a person able to innovate, adapt 
and be responsive to respond to challenges and business competition. 
Research respondents included 400 people aged 18 years to 28 years, active as students at private 
universities in the city of Surabaya. Respondents with varying religious backgrounds are Islam, 
Christianity, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Konghuchu. Respondents were tested with 21 
indicators to find interest and behavior in entrepreneurship. Statistical test using t test and f test with SPSS 
software to get the significance of indicators in shaping millennia generation entrepreneurship interests in 
Indonesia. 
The results of research that behavior often visits friends who have entrepreneurship significantly shapes 
entrepreneurial intentions. Family support also contributes positively and significantly to entrepreneurial 
intentions. The aspects of religion have varied effects in shaping entrepreneurial intentions and even the 
majority religion does not have a strong effect on shaping entrepreneurial intentions.

Abstract 
Organizations are increasingly using analytical tools to extract strategic information from data that have been collected 
over many years, in order to derive a competitive advantage in the global market. The level of use of such tools vary, 
and different maturity models are used to represent different analytics implementations within organizations. Maturity 
models have been developed for both business analytics and business intelligence separately. Objective of this study 
is to evaluate the maturity models developed recently. The business analytics maturity models consider both technical 
and business aspects. A few models have considered both theoretical and practitioner knowledge. Nevertheless, a lack 
of consideration for theoretical knowledge in developing maturity models was noted. Most models consisted of stages 
where maturity is described under each level corresponding to the factors relevant to each stage. Lot of similar factors 
can be seen among these models. These models act like a road map to achieve business analytics maturity within 
enterprises. It was also found that the maturity models were developed in a developed country setting. A need for an 
integrated maturity model with both technical and business aspects, incorporating the theoretical knowledge base and 
taking factors affecting business analytics maturity in developing countries was established.

1. Introduction
Business Analytics refers to use of computing to get insight from data. It includes Business Intelligence and also 
statistical analysis. Collection, storage, analysis and interpretation of data is business analytics (Davenport and Harris 
2007). Organizations are using analytics in various types to make their business functions effective and optimal. These 
data driven companies use predictive analytics, descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics and prescriptive analytics 
to solve day to day operations and run business in the long term. Analytics is primarily used in marketing related 
functions for understanding customer behavior and sales functions. Analytics is also used for financial related 
processes. Current development in technology especially with the advent of Industry 4.0 era, data and information has 
gained attention from stakeholders in organizations. Analytics is not a novel concept but when organizations do not 
get the strategic information from available data using current technology that has been invested, it would be difficult 
to progress to the next stage of maturity. Business analytics also includes Business Intelligence which is however 
somewhat familiar area to organizations. Organizations who use analytics have been relatively more successful and 
gained competitive advantage, compared to others who do not use analytics. Use of analytics is not a one off exercise, 
but is a continuous process with varying factors coming into prominence depending at the level of maturity within the 
organization. Both academics and practitioners have studied maturity in business analytics and developed Business 
Analytics maturity models.  The various models have wide similarities but some have distinctive features. However, 
most of them provide a roadmap to achieve maturity when using Business Analytics within organizations. It specifies 
the main factors that have to be addressed when moving up the maturity scale and how organizations should acquire 
those capabilities. With the rapid development of information technology over the last three decades, business 
analytics has been intertwined with technology, where data and systems are involved. Some models have considered 
both technical and business views of Business Analytics while some have prioritized one aspect. The objective of this 
study was to examine available Business Analytics maturity models including Business Intelligence maturity models. 
This paper provides a review of some of the more widely used business analytics maturity models and indicates the 
need for an integrative model with which takes into account both business and technical aspects.

When we consider the factors used in the above models, it can be categorized into two as business related factors and 
technical related factors. As business related factors people, culture, performance management, business strategy, 
leadership and skills were noted. Data management, integration, quality, governance and technology were the most 
common technical related factors. Another similarity among these models is many of them are stage developed models 
where stages or levels are defined with different factors. Most of these models have five stages while two models 
(Sacu and Spruit, 2010)’s model and TDWI (2009) have six stages. Only Gartner’s Business Analytics model 
Chandler et al. (2011) is not stage based even though Gartner’s Business Intelligence maturity model Wilen (2018) 
has five stages.  
 
According to the summary above, it is noted that most models have taken a combined perspective including both 
business and technical aspects. Business Analytics is a combination of both of these perspectives. Therefore, focusing 
on both business and technical aspects are very important when assessing maturity. However, it was noted that many 
models lacked a theoretical base when deriving the models, even though some of the factors were similar. Therefore, 
consideration of practitioner knowledge is crucial to understanding the real word applications and issues. Further, 
these maturity models are generic and does not factor in differences in enterprise capabilities.  
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Business Analytics and Business Intelligence maturity models have been developed considering both theoretical and 
practitioner knowledge. Many models have considered both business and technical aspects of Business Analytics 
with different factors. Even though there are several models, there is still a deficiency of an integrated model with 
both technical and business aspects that is derived from a theoretical base. None of these models is capable of 
assessing all relevant factors to Business Analytics. Stage level models have defined the capabilities that should be 
acquired to gain maturity, though there is still no consensus in the method of assessing current maturity level of 
organizations. Importantly all those models contain factors in a developed country setting which can be different to a 
developing country setting. Therefore, a need for an integrated model with both technical and business aspects 
incorporating a theoretical base to assess Business Analytics maturity in a developing country setting, is identified.

Abstract 
World population is rapidly increasing over time along with the people’s demands in terms of health. Pharmaceutical 
companies in the Philippines continue to produce medicines to accommodate the demands nowadays. They assure that 
every product is in good quality and meeting the customer’s expectations and standards. Thus, Philippine 
pharmaceutical companies focus on the workers’ sustained attention resulting to be as efficient and effective in doing 
their job. Through assessing the workers’ attention level, approximately sixty percent (60%) fall under 9,200ms which 
is considered to be low attention level that results to a high number of non-conformity products. To lessen this, 
researchers identified the significant factors affecting the workers’ sustained attention. Sustained attention to response 
task (SART) was used in measuring the workers’ attention level. The collected data were found normally distributed 
through the normality test, having a p-value of 0.095. Significant factors were identified with the use of multiple 
regression; however, BMI (0.237), working years (0.854) and noise (-0.724) were found to be positively weak, 
positively strong and negatively strong correlated with the sustained attention level. The recommendation presented 
in this research is ergonomic based intends to improve production workers’ sustained attention in pharmaceutical 
companies in relation to the abovementioned significant factors.

1. Introduction
The Philippines is ranked as the third-largest pharmaceutical market in the Association of South-East Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) and has a worth $3.6 billion in the year 2016. The Filipino pharmaceutical market is predicted to exceed $4 
billion by the year 2020, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of over 3.5% [1]. In a pharmaceutical company 
in the Philippines, approximately sixty percent (60%) of the production workers experience low attention level of eight 
(8) with a time of 9,200 ms and below as stated in the sustained attention to response task (SART) activity resulting
to non-conformity of products. Meanwhile, sustained attention plays an important role and has a significant impact in
any type of work especially to those health-related jobs like drug manufacturing [2]. Not only is the health of the
consumers being at stake but also the well-being of the workers [3]. One of the top problems experienced by a
pharmaceutical company is the struggle of meeting and exceeding the customers’ demand and its relationship to the
quality of medicines. Nowadays, consumers are knowledgeable about their rights and demand a high-quality product
that could satisfy their needs as side effects and dosage issues may lead not only expensive lawsuits, which directly
affects people’s lives [4]. Department of Health (DOH) reported that in the year 2013, there are five hundred thirty-
one thousand two hundred eighty (531,280) registered deaths caused by bacteria in all ages [5]. There are various
pharmaceutical manufacturers that produce anti-bacterial medicine that could reduce the percentage of mortality
caused by bacteria-related diseases. According to Ongoagchai, S., et al (2011), poor quality of medicines is considered
to be hazardous that may result in health implications, treatment failure and adverse effects [6]. This proves that
sustained attention is significant in drug manufacturing because taking medicines are people’s way to maintain and
improve their health from any sicknesses they have. In order to solve the problem, it is relevant to assess and identify
the significant factors that affect the sustained attention among pharmaceutical production workers and its effect on

After a direct observation and data collection from production workers experiencing low attention level in the 
Philippines, the researchers found out that the significant factors affecting the sustained attention level are body mass 
index, noise and working years. These factors have a significant impact in producing medicines resulting to a high 
number of non-conformity products. The researchers will recommend an ergonomic solution to enhance the sustained 
attention level of the workers that will result to lesser quantity of non-conformity products being produced by the 
company. (a) The company should execute and organize seminars and workshops discussing the significance of an 
individual’s sustained attention to their work. It is also vital to inform them of how much attention they should put in 
their assigned tasks. With these seminars and training, the workers will be able to regulate their workload and do their 
jobs properly and efficiently. The company could require their workers to attend a workshop called “Attention to  
Detail Workshop” depending on the time available for the workers. It is a two (2) to four-hour (4) workshop with 
exercises and lessons about attention to detail and five (5) fundamental elements as well as discussion and practice 
regarding how you can improve your attention whether individual or organizational. This workshop can be delivered 
at the location of the company’s choice, whether in an event or at a conference or training facilities. (b) In terms of 
improving their attention span, the company may also suggest a proper exercise to improve the attention of the 
workers. Lotus pose from yoga helps in improving the concentration of an individual, moreover, “Name that Colour 
test” exercise is used in neuropsychological evaluations to measure mental flexibility and help to train one’s attention 
and concentration as well. One’s attention can also be developed with reading long stuff slowly such as novels, books, 
articles and journals –it is claimed that reading can help boost and gain people’s sustained attention since books work 
for the circulation of the memory and brain. Reading increases the work capacity of the working memory including 
the visual, auditory processes, phonemic awareness, fluency, and comprehension and so, it increases the attention span 
of the reader. (c) Nonetheless, working years also contributes to the changes in an individual’s attention level in their 
work. It is claimed that being well-learned and familiar to tasks gives a significant impact on an individual’s working 
performance. This will result to a high probability of fewer errors in the job. The company should consider the length 
of years the workers have been working –because it is also a factor of how a worker is well-trained and know the job 
well. This will result to less quantity of non-conformity products. (d) In addition, the researchers recommend having 
a certain place or room for every process that uses machines. Noise provides an impact to the production workers’ 
attention level resulting in the change in concentration while doing their assigned work.

Abstract  
This research investigates the path from service quality dimensions to customer satisfaction and loyalty in 
supermarket customers of Sri Lanka. The expansion in the industry by international players coming to Sri Lanka and 
the competition prevailing in the industry emphasize the importance of this research. To certain extent this study 
contributes to fill the gap that exists due to the lack of knowledge about the path from service quality dimensions to 
customer loyalty in the country. Service quality dimensions identified through the literature survey namely 
Empathy, Reliability, Responsiveness, Tangibility and Assurance. The objective of this research is to identify the 
impact of service quality dimensions to customer satisfaction and then to customer loyalty, and to highlight the 
barriers to customer satisfaction & loyalty if any. Sample of this study consists of 500 supermarket customers in 
Colombo city and suburb. Data were collected through e-questionnaire by using Google Forms for the time period 
January 2018 to October 2018. The validity types concerned are the content validity and construct validity as the 
research constructs were measured using set of variables within each of them. The reliability of the scale 
measurements was tested for internal consistence using Cronbach’s Alpha and Composite Reliability. Hypotheses 
were tested using Structural Equation Model. According to the findings of the study, empathy is a major influencing 
factor in service quality dimensions in supermarkets in Sri Lanka. In addition that reliability, responsiveness, 
tangibility, assurance are also positively influence to the customers’ satisfaction. 
1. Background of the study
With tight profit margins and increasing competition, the supermarket’s success depends heavily on  its ability to 
retain customers . Indeed the longer customers remained with a particular market, the more profitable they became 
to the supermarket. A two percent increase in customer retention has the same effect on profits as cutting costs by 10 
percent.  Similarly a 5 percent reduction in customer defection rate can increase profits by 25-125 percent(Min, 
2010). 
Considering the significance of customer retention to the supermarket’s profitability, the supermarket should 
changing needs and preferences of customers. For example, the recent hike in fuel prices in Sri Lanka may force 
some customers to shop at the nearby supermarket or make fewer trips to the supermarket distant from their 
neighborhood.  Also those needs and preferences may represent various service attributes greater selection of

Abstract 
Electricity is a very important energy in the modern civilization. It helps us to be productive and improves the quality 
of living. Kappadi region of Udupi district in Karnataka India, faces many difficult to get access the electric energy. 
Therefore, it is very important to find new solutions for electric generation in the rural areas (at load centers) which 
are cost effective and sustainable. This project aims to make use of renewable resources such as hydro energy and 
convert it into useful electric energy by installing a micro hydro power plant at kappadi. As per the research and based 
on the calculations there is a probability of generation up to 20kw power from a head of 1.5 to 3.34 meters using bulb 
turbine. This paper comprises all the data which will help to analyze how power can be generated with less head, also 
it reveals all methods which were carried out well enough to ensure that this proposal is eximious.

1. Introduction
Electricity is accepted as one of the driving forces of economic development of all nations. The challenge of 
continuously generating electricity and meeting growing demands exerts tremendous pressure on energy infrastructure 
for both developed and developing nations [1]. 
India being a developing country fosters in enhancing the livelihood of its population. Though the focus of government 
is narrowed towards the urban sector, there are appreciable steps taken by the government for rural empowerment, but 
these are not effectively reaching the destitute (indigent).  In such cases, rural areas have to look for alternatives to 
make lives better. 
Due to the exploitation of non-renewable resources such as coal, gas, petroleum etc. (which accounts for 71% of 
Indian power generation source), If this trend continuous, electricity will be unaffordable. Being dense area, with high 
vegetative cover, large multipurpose projects are insane and inconvenient. Therefore, installation of micro power plant

6.Conclusion 
 
Micro hydro power plant [MHPP] proves to be the best alternative for power generation in remote areas especially in 
regions with dense vegetation and low economy. The selected site has the intensity to produce 10 to 20 KW which is 
very near to kappadi village. 17 houses situated near to this site, in rainy season, it’s difficult to supply power to this 
dense forest zone. Due to availability of source MHPP will serve 5 months without any problem. Payback period of 
this plant is 4 years and main advantage is already check dam is constructed for this stream.  
 
Since the head of water at bridge point was less we thought of providing a penstock to draw water for bridge point to 
place where we got the head as 3.18m (turbine point). To know the length of penstock that needs to be provided we 
carried out tachometric survey. The length of the penstock was found 89.23m. 
 
To install MHPP at site one of the necessary details required is topographical map. The topographical survey was 
carried to know the contour view of the site. Discharge is one of the parameter which is directly proportional to power 
generation. It was calculated by knowing the average stream flow velocity and average stream depth. Average stream 
velocity was found to be 0.212m/s and average stream depth was found to be 0.41m. By that the discharge was found 
to be 0.39m3/s. Power calculation is done based on the parameters of head and discharge. It was found that with our 
head and discharge available we can produce up to 13.79KW of energy which was found to be more than our 
requirement.

Abstract 
The telecommunications market is characterized by high unpredictability and volatility of demand as well as a great 
instability due to the existing strong competitive environment. Thus, it has become imperative for companies to invest 
on several continuous improvement tools, with a view to enhancement and stabilization of processes, standardization 
of labor and elimination of waste along the value chain. The work described in this paper was carried out in the 
warehouses of a well-known Portuguese telecommunications company that is characterized by a considerable 
innovative dimension and, due to its recent growth in the market, presents several problems in its logistics sector, 
which was not able to keep up with this expansion. The main objective was to eliminate/reduce the waste in the 
warehouse processes reducing logistics cost and therefore, creating value for the company. The implementation of a 
set of continuous improvement (lean) tools such as ABC analysis, spaghetti diagrams, and layout redesign allowed 
the looked-for value adding to the inner processes.

1. Introduction
In the modern competitive setting, boosted by the great phenomenon of globalization, companies are increasingly 
looking to respond in a quick and agile manner to their customers and differentiate themselves from the competition. 
Consumers are increasingly informed and challenging, which has contributed to changes in demand patterns. On the 
other hand, markets are quite saturated and, to survive, a company needs to understand these new challenges and be 
adaptive. 
Accompanying this development, logistics operations have become increasingly complex and comprehensive, pushing 
the organizational boundaries and assuming stronger links along the supply chain. 
In this study, the company in analysis belongs to the telecommunications market, which is a very unstable and volatile 
market whose products have increasingly shorter life cycles. Due to the high growth of the company and increased 
sales volume, the number of product references in warehouse increased significantly. Thus, it is extremely important 
for the company to create appropriate storage infrastructure and apply a continuous improvement philosophy to impel 
a sustainable progress. 
It this context the work focuses the logistics function performance, and, in particular, the warehouse management in 
order to improve the operations, recognizing that it is from this internal value creation that the company can respond 
quickly to customer needs and requirements.

Figure 1. New layout of the warehouses of the company 
 
The new layout joins warehouse 1 and warehouse 2 in an integrated way being the first one (right side of Fig.1) 
devoted to raw materials and embracing the relocated Megamat, Kardex and Double-Deck storage areas, and the 
second one (left side of Fig.1) dedicated to reception and expedition of finished product. The working areas are now 
well defined and delimitated and the resizing of the corridors (and the racks) allow the proper circulation of material 
handling equipment and picking activities. There are products where it is observed a reduction in picking time of about 
30 minutes. 
The criteria for allocation of materials to the shelves was based on an ABC analysis of materials’ movements (inbound 
and outbound). 
Analyzing the daily movements of a typical warehouse worker, it is evident the biggest improvement in their reduction 
(Fig.2). To complete the same tasks, the worker walks, in the new solution, less 500 meters.

In order to normalize the various working methods and processes carried out in the warehouses it was also 
implemented a Daily Kaizen divided into four levels of intervention: organization of the working team (level 1), 
organization of the workplace (level 2), standards (level 3) and problem solving (level 4). 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The main objective of the project was to eliminate/reduce the waste in the warehouse processes reducing logistics cost 
and therefore, creating value for the company.

The implementation of a set of continuous improvements measures such as human resources management, definition 
of a new obsolete material policy through the creation of a new life cycle for the various items of the company, 
definition of a new layout, and creation of new methods to allocate materials to the shelves was very relevant being 
obvious the good operational results. 
The involvement of top management was critical in this process. Nevertheless, a cultural change across the 
organization is steel needed. There was a “natural” resistance to change the procedures and “ways of doing” but the 
greater involvement of top management and the workers’ training plan was encouraging. The culture of the company 
and the dedication of the management influences positively the commitment of workers in the continuous 
improvement process and, obviously, the results. 
An audit system was also implemented because it has been proven to work as an important incentive, motivation and 
control tool. 
The company still has a long way to go to reach the so desired efficiency of the logistics system. It should follow up 
the sector innovations investing efforts towards continuous improvement. 
In a near future it is needed an intervention on suppliers management. It will be essential to carry out various 
negotiations with suppliers in order to level their deliveries.

Abstract 
Mobile Learning Application (MLA) is an accommodating technology to instructors wherein their lessons and other 
usable features in teaching can be done and applied online. In the Philippines, the application of this technology 
seems to be still lacking, most especially among high school students in government-owned institutions. At present, 
the subject of this study uses an online application to help senior high school students focusing on accounting and 
business management to review and understand their lessons further. Based from the SUS survey, the current mobile 
application utilized has a computed mean score of 55.25%, which is below the 68% marginal average scale for a 
usable system. This study aims to identify the statistically-significant variables affecting the usability of a mobile 
learning application to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness in improving the user experience of the students. 
Recommendations in this study uses the significant variables in creating an ergonomically-designed mobile learning 
application that will improve its user effectiveness and its usability to be utilized as a student-centered academic 
learning portal.

1. Introduction
In the Philippines, a vast amount of senior high school enrolments were recorded nationwide, with over one million 
students is expected annually to enter in government-owned schools. Out of the possible enrolments in this sector, 
Accounting and Business Management (ABM) is the third most considered senior high school strand with recorded 
219,313 enrollees. ABM strand gives an understanding in relation to fields such as marketing, economics, 
accountancy, and business management. ABM strand helps senior high school students be more familiar in what 
they may face before entering college and working in the corporate industry.  
Senior High School education in the Philippines is starting to integrate technology-based education to the usual 
teaching method. As technology advances, schools have adopted the utilization of gadgets such as smartphones as a 
teaching tool which comprises mobile learning applications relative to the needs of the user. Mobile Learning 
Application (MLA) is one of the tools that was used in the Philippines to facilitate the learning of the students. In 
connection, the usability of the mobile learning application is one of the key factors in order to meet the satisfaction 
of users. Quality of the system can affect the User Experience (UX) satisfaction in which gives a user-friendly User 
Interface (UI). 
The study will focus on the usability evaluation of a mobile learning application intended for business management 
senior high school students in the Philippines. Based on the computed mean of SUS questionnaire, the current 
mobile learning application only has a mean score of 55.25%, which is less than the 68% marginal mean score for a

Abstract 
It is common to think about evaluation when considering performance management in education systems 
and vice versa. Nevertheless, both concepts have risen from knowledge areas that evolved separately. 
Recent research provided empirical evidence that evaluation, which relies on the use of performance data, 
enhances in practice performance management. Several scholars highlighted differences between these two 
approaches and their possible complementarity when they are aligned. This complementarity is valid for 
most of the OECD countries which implemented a standards-based assessment and evaluation in Education 
Systems.  
A recent review confirms that ""Napoleonic"" states are characterized by a strong resistance to the education 
system reforms brought by the New Public Management (NPM) particularly when evaluation reports are 
used for performance measurement purposes. Moreover, the application of NPM in developing countries 
remains globally embryonic and complex while it is widely adopted in OEDC countries.  
Through a review of the literature, we explore, in this work, avenues to guarantee complementarity between 
evaluation and performance management in complex education system and how their outcomes lead to 
educational equity and Effectiveness. We use Morocco as an empirical case study to give insights about the 
two issues.

Introduction 
Performance Management, as a concept, was developed since the 1970s. It experienced a significant growth and 
primacy in the public sector only in the 90s with the introduction of the New public management (NPM). Scholars in 
the UK and Australia introduced the NPM theory to describe approaches and currents of thoughts in OECD countries 
to reform the public sector by adopting private sector model (Hood, C.,1991; Arnaboldi, M., et al., 2015).  
 NPM is summarized as ‘three Ms’: Markets, Managers and Measurements. The Measurements element, which forms 
the principal key of the NPM implementation, foregrounded a way of thinking in which ‘Accountability’ and 
‘Performance Management’ approaches were developed to impact the way in which public service delivery was 
organized (Lowe, T., & Wilson, R.,2017). 
Most OEDC countries have established performance management in the public sector and developed a real industry 
of performance measurement. Globally, after having successfully enhanced the public services delivery, there was a 
shift in thinking about performance management which evolved from searching efficiency and transparency to 
focusing on effectiveness. This brought the practitioners to develop means of measuring results (outcomes) instead of 
measuring inputs and outputs. Outcomes Based Performance Management (OBPM) which was a way of making a

Morocco has been experiencing a period of rapid economic growth. From 1980 to 2010, gross domestic product (GDP) 
growth averaged 4 percent. Overall poverty has also decreased considerably. Despite this progress and economic 
growth, Morocco is still far from achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In fact, the weakness of the Human 
Development Index HDI (0.667) due to the low levels of development in health and education and to the inequality in 
human and economic development remains major issues in Morocco, notably between urban and rural areas and across 
different regions (Gini index = 39,5%). (Ibourk, A., & Amaghouss, J., 2014; World Bank., 2019).  
Morocco succeed, during the last two decades, to meet the challenge of the widespread access to the primary education 
and to improve the school enrolment rate in the secondary education. But several challenges and hurdles are facing 
the Moroccan Education System related to efficiency and effectiveness that several studies have related to quality of 
education and governance (Ndela, J. F. N. et al., 2016; BAD, 2014; CSEFRS, 2016): 
• 
Youth unemployment in Morocco is among the highest in the MENA region (28.80%); 
• 
Public spending on education in Morocco is high compared to other countries;  
• 
The inefficiency of public spending in education is large in Morocco and pointed at large potential efficiency 
gains.  
• 
The persistent inequalities in economic and human development in Morocco, particularly for early child 
development (ECD), that impact negatively educational outcomes (Ejjanoui, F., et al., 2015).  
 
5. Conclusion: 
 
Performance management approaches are widely adopted in developed countries and some developing countries 
education systems.   
Critical studies which have took interest for their effectiveness led precursor countries to improve them without 
abandoning them. This has allowed them to mature in the recent years. Academic or empirical research that has 
accompanied this implementation has contributed significantly to this development. 
The link between education system performance management approaches with those of the evaluation seems to give 
visible results for the education systems effectiveness. It could, however, constitute a real failure factor if there is a 
lack of consistency and complementarity. 
The case study of Morocco revealed new evidence in research on relevance of performance management in education 
system developing countries. Morocco is among the first non-OECD countries to develop a conceptual standard-
based-assessment and evaluation platform which basically links performance management and evaluation approaches.  
Based on the findings of this works, we will investigate in future research the feasibility of a data-driven framework 
to potentially integrate performance management and evaluation practices in education systems. This could be the key 
to conquer the complexity of education systems and lead to better governance.

Abstract 
In today’s era, global warming is playing a major role in raising the average temperature of Earth’s surface due 
to rising levels of greenhouse gases. It has led to severe climatic changes worldwide, including rise in sea level, 
depletion of ozone layer and has had many negative effects on the ecosystem. In an attempt to alleviate these 
negative effects, the scientific community is focusing its efforts towards harnessing renewable energy resources 
and development of environment-friendly energy efficient systems. However, constraints like the initial cost and 
specific operating conditions for adapting these innovative technologies are of major obstacle in their practical 
implementation.  
In the scenario of a developing country like India, using solar power as a sustainable source of renewable energy 
is highly feasible due to its abundant availability. The present work describes three innovative products which 
would contribute to the Indian critical and ever-increasing energy demands keeping in mind adverse 
environmental effects. The products described are selectively diverse and not compulsively constrained to a 
specific application since they are most common for domestic use in India. The working principle, return on 
investment analysis and methodology of product design are discussed in depth.

1. Introduction
India, being a developing country, holds energy as a majorly important asset and is the third largest global 
consumer of electricity in the world after China and the United State of America [1]. In spite of being one of the 
largest consumers, with a population of about 1.27 billion, India has one of the lowest per capita energy 
consumption in the world, which is one-third of the world’s average per capita energy consumption [1]. Of the 
world’s 1.3 billion people who live without access to power, a quarter — about 300 million — live in rural India 
[1]. In India, the demand of electricity per head is more than generation of electricity. As a result, it can be seen 
that many power cuts occur especially in rural areas, and a large disparity of power consumption exists between 
the urban and rural areas. Although India has a self-sufficient capacity of power generation, the main reasons for 
these power cuts are lack of resources like inadequate infrastructure for transmission, disruptions in domestic 
fuel transport, failures of transformers, transmission and distribution losses, theft of power and technical 
problems in moving electricity between various areas. With the rapid growth of industrialization in India, energy 
consumption is bound to increase further expeditiously. Industrialization has already increased the consumption 
by multiple times. The per capita consumption in India has almost doubled in the current millennium [1]. With

2.3.2. RoI Analysis 
 
The typical conventional dryer which is driven by electricity has 4 trays, each having area of 12” X 12” [16]. On 
the other hand, the solar-powered drying unit has a single large tray of area 16” X 32”. One needs to calculate 
equivalent area to compare the electricity consumption with solar energy. Executing the same, the drying area of 
electrically driven conventional dryer unit requires equivalent to about 3.5 trays as a substitute of a single solar 
dryer tray area. Consequently, the energy consumption of only 3.5 trays needs to be considered instead of 4. The 
power consumption of the conventional electric drying unit is reported to be 220 W [16]. The standard time for 
drying the watermelon which consumes least time to be dried is around 8 hrs, whereas grapes consume highest 
amount of time to be dried which is around 26 hrs. The average time for drying of commercial fruits comes out 
to be around 14 hrs as per the standard references [17]. Accordingly, the energy consumption of the 
conventional electric drying unit for the present analysis would be 0.22 X (3.5/4) X 14 × = 2.695 kW-hr. The 
average cost of electricity in non-residential and commercial sector in India is ₹ 7.12 per kW-hr [8]. This yields 
the electric consumption to be 2.695 X 7.12 = ₹ 19.2 per day. On the basis of market inquiries, the cost of a 
solar drying unit is around ₹ 18,800 [18] and that for a conventional electric dryer is around $ 130 (i.e.₹ 9,350) 
[19]. This offers a recovery of investment in ((18,800 – 9,350) / 19.2 = 493 days, i.e. around 1 year 4 months. 
 
3. Concluding Remarks 
 
Of the 1.4 billion people in the world who have no access to electricity, India accounts for over 160 million 
living in around 32 million homes [20]. The technologies and fuel sources that India has adopted are inadequate 
in providing the required energy and are continuously depleting. As a result of this, it could be seen that 
majority of the rural areas are completely lacking with supply of electrical energy. To overcome this, shifting to 
solar energy as a renewable energy source is proposed in the present work as India has abundant solar energy 
supply to completely fulfill its energy requirements. The present work discusses about three such innovative 
products which are environment-friendly alternatives to their nonconventional counterparts. 
The above-mentioned products play a vital role in the domestic and semi-commercial scenario in India. As far 
as the domestic applications are concerned, the prime focus must be towards satisfying the requirement in the 
easiest possible manner and in the most economical way. Many rural areas in India do not receive adequate 
electrical energy to power conventional desalination systems. This problem could be overcome with the use of a 
solar-powered desalination unit. This unit completely relies on solar energy which would ultimately yield 
extensive amount of national saving in terms of energy. Another innovative product is the solar-powered trash 
compactor which is quite useful in an urban scenario. A very high amount of waste is generated in urban areas 
which doesn’t have any proper disposal practices in India. The conventional waste compactor uses quite high 
amount of energy which is not economical. The solar waste compactor is a much more feasible solution as could 
be seen from the Return on Investment Analysis provided. The solar dryer, on the other hand, has a wide usage 
in the agricultural sector. Drying of fruits, vegetables, dry fruits, meat and flesh, etc. using conventional sources 
such as supplying thermal energy are proven to be quite slow and uneconomical as thermal energy is a low

Abstract 
With the evolution of industry 4.0, the procurement 4.0 has recently emerged with higher advantages. With these 
higher advantages, procurement 4.0 plays a major role in the domain of organization value chain. In an organization, 
procurement division can create new business models for itself and more from being a cost center to a profit center 
whereas changing what they buy as well as the ways in which they buy. Therefore the purchasing of products and 
services will increase dramatically in a proper way. The purpose of this study is to explore how the pillars of 
procurement 4.0; specifically, competitiveness, collaboration, digitalization and agility can be integrated to build 
strategic relationship with suppliers in the procurement process to enhance the overall performance and organizational 
efficiency that simultaneously lead improving customer experience and supplier performance of apparel industry. This 
study is based on a comprehensive, systematic review of literature published in relation to the areas of strategic 
supplier relationship and procurement 4.0 applicable to the apparel industry. The findings of this research is based on 
reviews of 25 articles which describe different models, frames, processes and appropriate theoretical terms. Through 
the effective categorization and integrative analysis of above findings this paper expects to introduce an innovative 
conceptual model of how to develop strategic supplier relationships to maximize the effectiveness of the apparel 
industry.

1. Introduction
With the evolution of the automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, the Industry 4.0 trend is 
currently evolving to different aspects. It includes cyber physical systems, the internet of things, cloud computing and 
cognitive computing. The concept is now applying for different functions in the value chain and procurement 4.0 is 
one of the latest approaches that develops new value propositions, meet new business needs and integrate data across 
functions and value chains. To make the most of the potential of procurement 4.0, reshaping the procurement 
organization and its capabilities will be required while taking the challenges and opportunities of the expanding global 
digital revolution.  
Strategic relationship between suppliers and buyers can be defined as a mutual ongoing relationship involving a 
commitment over a long period of time and a sharing of information, risk, awards of the relationship among both 
parties (Lisa M.Ellaram, 1990). When it is reviewed the past few decades of business world, managers have been 
interested in having a long term collaborative strategic relationship with few suppliers rather than involving in large 
number of suppliers. Businesses are focusing their attention to not only select the most appropriate suppliers but also 
on finding ways to transform current buyer-supplier relationship such that buyers can achieve more appropriate value 
addition to the business in the future (Cox, 2001)  
Sri Lanka’s apparel industry is the second largest industry that contributes to the national income. Over the past four 
decades, apparel industry has enjoyed epic growth levels and is today Sri Lanka’s primary foreign exchange earner 
accounting to 40% of the total exports and 52% of industrial products exports (Sri Lanka Export Development Board, 
n.d.)

must concern about the adaptation for the changes. R & D investments may provide benefits after a certain period 
while increasing the operating cost in the short run would be an issue in this situation.  A joint improvement driven 
by mutual interdependence can be suggested to overcome these confounding problems where the cost and expert 
knowledge can be collaboratively contributed. Further innovative solutions or technology enhancements can be 
conducted to reduce defects in the material where the supplier and buyer separately incurred then can be shared. This 
will increase output quality and user satisfaction while reducing development cost. 
Success of apparel industry has lied on providing right quantity of quality outputs to the relevant customer on the 
specific time at a reasonable price. This framework will support that by reducing transaction cycle time, transaction 
cost, inventory cost, defect lot and development cost while increasing output quality and user satisfaction. These will 
reduce total procurement cost and increase market share that keep smooth flow of apparel production. In the long run, 
the efficiency of apparel industry is expected to be improved. 
In future researches can be conducted to collect data for a comprehensive measurement of value gained by strategic 
relationship building with suppliers in apparel industry and can be extended for empirical verification of the frame 
work. Therefore, further research is needed to identify new trends in the apparel industry and innovation to improve 
the process, strategies and operations.

Considering Seasonal Demand using Discrete Event 
Simulation

Abstract 
Warehouse is a part of logistic system that serves to store products at each node in a supply chain. The presence of 
specific elements in the fertilizer products causes them not to be stored in any places as it may deteriorate the products. 
Determining the best scenario in the process of storing fertilizers that have seasonal demand is complex. This is due 
to the uncertainty in the amount of fertilizer productions at each day, and also the amount of demand orders as well as 
the arrival time of the delivery orders (DO) for each fertilizer product. In addition, when the warehouses are 
overcapacity, which is often the case, there is a chance that products are stored outside in the open storage (OPS) or 
in other warehouses that are not dedicated for the products. Therefore, this paper tries to solve this problem using 
discrete event simulation method. With this method, different scenarios are possible to be investigated without 
affecting the daily operational performance. This study aims to provide a recommendation for the scheme of fertilizer 
storage process in a company so as to reduce the opportunity lost due to product damage.

1. Introduction
Warehouse has an important role in a supply chain. According to Kulwiec (1985), the warehouse has main functions 
to provide temporary shelters, consolidate consumer demands, give service facilities to consumers, separate items that 
are easily contaminated and dangerous, and protect the products. In terms of production, the warehouse is a supporting 
facility, which gives a temporary accommodation for protecting final products before being sent to customers. Under 
these definitions, the warehouse plays an important role in backing the success of the company's supply chain activities 
(Frazelle, 2002). 
One of the main activities in a warehouse is stockpiling. With this function, according to Tompkins et al. (2010), 
goods are sent to the next stage in each supply chain configuration expectedly without damaging or changing the basic 
form of these goods. To achieve this target, every activity in the warehouse needs to be kept carefully to maintain the 
properties of the products. Each product has a different storage method depending on the characteristics of the product. 
One product that requires special treatment is fertilizer. This product is the object of this research. 
Several researches have been found related to the warehouses and/or storages. Wutthisirisart et al. (2015) studied the 
evaluation of additional warehouse when the company’s owned warehouse cannot store its products due to increasing 
demand. Unlike our research that the additional warehouse is open storage, Wutthisirisart’s research has an option to 
rent one or more warehouses to keep its excess inventory. The research also proposes the methods for selecting 
material locations in order to minimize the transportation and total storage costs. In a study, Siswanto et al. (2018a) 
study the effect of supply disruptions on the transportation as well as in the warehouse system. Whenever the 
disruptions occurred, the company may increase its production rate to cover the production loss. As a result of this, 
the inventory will increase significantly which may cause the warehouse experiences over capacity which halt to 
produce the products.

5. Conclusion 
 
Based on the research and experiment that have been done, there are conclusions can be drawn. First, the internal 
warehouse owned by the company has not been able to carry out its functions properly because in 2016 there was still 
2.101.958 tons of fertilizer products kept on OPS. This caused products to damage and made the company suffer an 
opportunity loss. Second, the levels of storages often reach their maximum capacities because the demand rate of 
fertilizers depends on the season, i.e. the planting season and non-planting season where the demand rate of fertilizers 
in the non-planting season is smaller than the production rate. Inventory during non planting season will accumulate 
in the warehouse both indoor and OPS. Third, the experiment has shown that changing the policy by selecting the 
indoor warehouse over OPS has reduced the amount of products stored outside as well as the total distance traveled 
by the products. However, the amount of damaged product has not been decreased under this development scenario. 
Finally, the experimental results are not able to achieve the research objectives so that the development of other 
scenarios should be carried out for further analysis. This will be our next research agenda.

Abstract 
The South African higher education terrain has undergone massive transformation through curriculum 
transformation involving programme alignment. There are three technical town planning schools out 
of the eleven town planning schools in South Africa and these were the hardest hit by the curriculum 
changes. These technical planning schools phased out technical programmes, and introduced bachelor 
and honours degrees. This paper investigates the possible pathways of curriculum transformation for 
technical planning schools critical to the retention of practical skills training within the new 
programmes. The paper adopted a phenomenological case study research design and applied the 
qualitative research approach. Content analyses were used to derive meaning from the collected data. 
Preliminary findings reveal three possible pathways that could be adopted by the technical planning 
schools to ensure that new curriculated degrees produce graduates with practical town planning skills. 
The new degree programmes that replaced technical programmes need to place graduates and 
universities at par with conventional universities in terms of recognition and quality. Pursuit to that, the 
paper recommends the infusion of the uniqueness of the phased technical programmes in the new 
degree programmes to deliver competitive, marketable qualifications that are preferred by students and 
valued by industry.

7. Conclusion   
The paper concludes by acknowledging the important role the new degree programmes that replaced the technical 
programmes as they serve well both the graduates and the universities by placing them at par with the other 
conventional universities and their programmes in terms of recognition and national qualification framework levels. 
However it is recommended that there must be concerted efforts to ensure that the uniqueness of the technical 
programmes being phased out is not completely by among others infusing some of the old training packages within 
the new degree programmes, thus making them more competitive, marketable and preferred by the students and by 
extension the industry. The multiple pathways approach influences what goes inside the classroom and prepares 
students for both university qualification and careers. It corporates many useful improvement strategies that are 
already implemented and builds upon them to create a more comprehensive approach that any school can adopt to 
improve outcomes. Waiting any longer to support an approach may mean failing a generation of students who will 
leave university without preparation to succeed in careers. Multiple pathways would give more students a reason to 
achieve and persist in school and the tool required to transition to further education, productive employment, and good 
citizenship.

Abstract 
The higher education fraternity in South Africa has been undergoing a metamorphosis in response to 
competing demands to modernise in line with the local and international standards. The efficacy of blended 
teaching and diverse assessment approaches in the field of town planning has not been well documented. 
This work investigates the impact of blended learning and innovative assessments on town planning 
students’ performance and success rates. The study adopted the phenomelogical case study research design 
and a mixed method approach where both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered, analysed and 
presented. Statistical, content, and document analyses were used to interpret data from students and teachers 
participating in blended learning and innovative assessments at the University of Johannesburg. Preliminary 
results reveal that blended learning and the application of diverse assessments methods to town planning 
students significantly increase and improve the success rates. The work concludes by acknowledging the 
positive impact of properly tailored and packaged blended learning approaches where both contact and 
online classes, and innovative assessments enhance understanding of town planning concepts. Town 
planning schools need to adopt teaching and learning approaches that incorporate both contact and online 
learning, and assorted assessments to enhance student understanding and success rate.

on most occasions do not grasp the basics firmly and this leads to one on one consultations. A higher feedback of 
student enjoy the one on one consultations as they get to ask all questions they have in regards to any topic or 
assessments they do not understand. On the other hand, lectures do not mind the one on one consultation, however, 
the problem is, it can be time consuming as many students come to consult individually with the same challenge. In 
line with the above, a higher feedback from lectures in regards to the face to face tuition agree to be good as they can 
teach the whole concept in a classroom to all students at once and students who do not understand the concepts taught 
can ask questions immediately after a lecture. Some of the students, do not understand everything that is taught in 
class and are not confident enough to ask questions in class or in front of other students and they feel that one on one 
consultations with a lecture works well for them. Further, both lectures and students agree to blended learning to be a 
good approach as it covers all aspects and dimension and try not to leave any negative gaps in-between. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Blended learning is crucial since adult students have an individualistic learning and cognitive style for processing 
information, which demands that distance teaching programmes include a variety of activities and learning modes, 
and educators use teaching models responsive to individual styles, as face-to-face meetings have their own techniques 
of benefiting students (Brundage and MacKeracher, 1980; Cercone, 2008; Gravani and Karagiorgi 2014). Further, the 
judicious application of blended learning facilitates the development of students into team players, leaders and 
professionals who have connected their understanding and their new found skills. In fact, blended learning assists 
students to work well with people also manage to work individually (Twelves and Arasaratnam 2013). The work 
concludes by acknowledging the positive impact of properly tailored and packaged blended learning approaches and 
innovative assessments that enhance an understanding of town planning concepts and students’ performance. 
 
5. Recommendations 
 
The paper ends by recommending that town planning schools need to adopt various ways of teaching and learning by 
incorporating both contact and online learning to improve both access and success rates of their students. It has been 
highlighted that all alternatives provided for learning can be beneficial in their own unique way, hence, it is 
recommend to strengthen blended learning. Further, as there are students that are interested in enrolling for the 
programme, howerever, cannot attend classes as most of them can come as they work, and live far. This could increase 
numbers of students enrolling for Town and Regional Planning.

Abstract 
A CMS (Corrosion Management System) is the management system including specific documentation 
identifying the processes and reengineering procedures affecting the corrosion management which is 
basically needed for Planning (PLAN), Implementation (DO), monitoring and measurement (CHECK) and 
defining the corrective action (ACT), also the ability of the organization to manage the threat of harmful 
corrosion phenomenon for future asset integrity management. 
Choosing an appropriate CMS model which is fitted for gas supply chain from basic design and early 
engineering via installation, commissioning, operation and sweetening process, transmission, and 
distribution of the natural gas is the main managerial challenge for the stakeholders of this project. (Note 
that there is no events or standard model for implementation of CMS in such this case) 
The purpose of this paper is introducing a methodology for selecting a suitable CMS roadmap.

1. INTRODUCTION
According to the NACE IMPACT 2016 report which is studied corrosion phenomena cost in 2013, the
global corrosion costs was estimated in 2.5 trillion USD in this year which is equal to 3.4 US GDP (Gross
Domestic Product) in year 2013! By means of implementation of suitable corrosion management system,
according to the best practices studies it is estimated that amount of 10-25% of the corrosion costs could be
saved; which is the amount of 340-875 billion USD per year is taken into the account[1]; What a big deal!
As per previous studies by NACE the corrosion phenomena is the primary threat affecting the reliability
and life cycle of assets that decline crucial energy sources throughout the worldwide. The estimated annual
corrosion-related costs is about 7 billion USD to monitor, repair (and maintenance) of the assets. According
to this study the corrosion- related cost of operation and maintenance is estimated up to 80% of this cost
[2]. In order to control and manage the corrosion threats (or impact) it should be taken into account the
consequences and likelihood of corrosion phenomena occurrences simultaneously. For the purposes of this
paper, for selecting appropriate model for CMS implementation in purposed company, the consequence (or
impact) of corrosion phenomena is considered as the potential or actual money loss due to corrosion effects
(leakages and metal loss) associated by the Health, Safety and Environmental aspects, or asset integrity
management system concerns. The first criteria (money loss) could be taken into account as quantifiable
value when taking into consideration of direct and indirect costs including (revenue losses, maintenance
(repairmen), and clean-up costs, material costs and etc. which is called the Direct Costs). Other perspective
of corrosion threat include decline of an asset to the point where it is no longer fit for its intended purpose
(e.g., future production losses, Environmental crisis fines such as soil contamination, air pollution, river

8. CONCLUSIONS 
As per ISO 55000 standard series for Physical Asset Management (PAM) requirement mentioned, 
Corrosion Management is an critical asset management tool, and recommended to imitate it from early 
engineering steps during conceptual design stages of a new projects up to end of life-cycle of any plants 
and assets. 
The recent developments and so the standard approaches are focused on risk–based orientation strategies 
and also integrity management practices. The case study is determined that major cost savings will be 
occurred by developing a risk-based approach that includes both technical inspection and corrosion 
management strategies.  
To establish a successful corrosion management system is only applicable through management 
commitment, effective communication, teamwork, and making sure that the capable personnel are present 
in the project team.  
In this case study, a research project is defined and the main target set to establish a native corrosion 
management system in order to reduce and control the effective and optimal corrosion and associated 
costs. As the nature of research projects, where there is no evidence for a standard method for 
implementation of CMS (like ISO55000 standard series requirements for PAM) in NIGC, and client 
managements request, the roadmap for implementation of CMS is under study and initial results (the 
strategic roadmap) is shown in figure 5.  
Meanwhile the process-oriented models for implementing native CMS in chosen pilot plants (including 
engineering and development projects, gas sweetening plants, a district of gas transmission pipeline 
including gas compressing stations) are under development.

1. INTRODUCTION
Reverse engineering also well-known as back engineering. Is the process of reproducing of a certain part 
with unknown measurements, sketch model or any information related to that part. The goal of reverse 
engineering is to collect the whole engineering design data about the physical existing part, which allow 
the opportunity for recreation. The mechanism of reverse engineering should include 3D scanner and a 
software that match 3D scanner machine, with the help of Geomagic Design X to extracts the CAD 
model.

As shown in the table the modeled part has measurement which matches the original part   which tell us 
that our scan was successful and it captured most of the features , In addition now it’s ready to be 3D 
printed or manufactured because we obtained the CAD file.In the second model we tried to repair the 
defect areas of the gear so it will be brand new . 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
In conclusion a gear part have been selected to be modeled due to the defects appeared in the original 
part, and the need for new part in a very limited time. 
 
In this paper work the scanning of the gear is done with the help of Artec Space Spider machine, then the 
part has been imported in a CAD software which is Geomagic Design for developing a model for it.

Abstract 
Solid waste management comprises all efforts geared towards solid waste collection, transportation, recovery, 
recycling and processing. Developing Countries still grapple with very poor waste management practices. This 
occurs as a result of poor planning and scheduling, ranging from collection techniques and transportation from the 
dumpsters to the landfill centers. Lack of timeous solid waste collection and disposal planning and control measures 
can result in excessive dumpster overflows on one hand. The other extreme of having dumpsters premature for 
evacuation is also possible. This paper reviews approaches of municipal solid waste management strategies. The 
data used for the study consist of articles carefully selected from peer reviewed journals with very high impact. The 
major interest was to ascertain different approaches to solid waste management, with more emphases on municipal 
solid waste generation, collection, and transportation techniques. There still exist significant gaps between the waste 
management endeavors suggested in past literatures and the approaches that can be tailored to specific developing 
locations. This is with due regards to availability of good models, but developed for advanced economies with fully 
developed public infrastructure. The results show that a robust solid waste management model that can cater for the 
realities of a developing Municipalities can be explored.

Abstract 
In today’s society that disasters seem to be striking all corners in Bangladesh and the globe, the importance 
of emergency management is undeniable. Much human loss and unnecessary destruction of infrastructure 
can be avoided with more foresight and specific planning. Most of the people die due to lack of medicines 
and proper treatment so it is necessary to supply first aid medicines right after any severe disaster. The goal 
of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model that involves transporting medicines from different 
supply sources to different distribution centers in response to Cyclones in the southwest coastal areas of 
Bangladesh to maximize the survival rate of the affected population, which is modeled using linear 
programming in order to find the optimal quantity of cartons containing medicines which will be supplied 
to affected people and also the optimal transportation cost and time. Excel Solver and simulation software 
Analytica® Optimizer has been used to model and solve this problem.    
Keywords 
Optimization, Linear Programming, Transportation Cost, Supply Chain. 
1.0 Introduction 
The immediate priority after a natural disaster is providing emergency first aid and medical services to injured persons. 
‘Disaster’ is defined by The World Health Organization (WHO) as any occurrence that causes damage, destruction, 
ecological disruption, loss of human life, human suffering, deterioration of health and health services on a scale 
sufficient to warrant an extraordinary response from outside the affected community or area. The aspect of saving 
human lives, lies the field known as Disaster and Emergency Medicine which is the basis of dealing with these 
complex challenges. 
Akkihal, A. R. (2006), considers a battery of mixed-integer linear programs for locating warehouses for non-
consumable inventories required for the initial deployment of aid after a disaster occurrence. Nolz et al. (2010), 
provide a multi-criteria Meta heuristic based on evolutionary concepts for planning water distribution tours in disaster 
relief, determining the physical location of water tanks and selecting roads to be used for the transportation of drinking 
water. 
Bangladesh is a country that has been intrinsically associated with natural disaster and vulnerability. The geographical 
vulnerability of our country lies in the fact that it is an exceedingly flat, low-lying, alluvial plain covered by over 230

demand of this distribution center another supply source Kalinagar will supply 162 cartons which is also the optimal 
quantity. Total storage capacity was 2000 carton which will be supplied to fulfill the demand. Total demand is 1673 
which was found out according to the cyclone intensity. After solving the model total supply will be equal to total 
demand which is also 1673. With the optimal solution, optimized transportation cost and time is also calculated which 
is 2570 TK. and 893 min respectively. For this same problem Analytica® optimizer simulation software was used to 
solve this. Result of the simulation software is a graphical display which presents similar optimal solution as excel 
solver. Since the output from both Excel Solver and simulation is same, the solution is considered optimal and effective 
to emergency response to Cyclone management.

Abstract 
Carbone dioxide emissions is a global issue which has catastrophic consequences that beyond the universal climate 
change. Carbon emissions interact with other human demands on this planet, such as food, fibers, timber, and land for 
dwellings and roads. This paper presents a linear programming model for the optimal electricity generation-mix 
problem to meet a specified CO2 emission target. The objective function minimizes the weighted sum of two terms: 
the electricity generation cost and the CO2 emissions cost. Most of the electricity generation mix problem literature 
considers fixed and aggregated demand and capacity over the year. However, the electricity demand and generation 
capacity are dynamic parameters in hourly and/or daily basis. The proposed model contributes to the literature by 
modeling the hourly electricity demand, daily and hourly electricity generation capacity, and daily CO2 emissions 
limit. The model is solved optimally with a case study derived based on the electricity sector 2030 plan in South 
Africa. Results show that the proposed model proposes generation-mix plans that could achieve the CO2 reduction 
target. Furthermore, electricity generation cost and CO2 emissions are eliminated.

1. Introduction
Electrical energy demand is increasing exponentially all over the world. For example, the total electricity consumption 
for South Africa recorded a growth of 17% from 265,457 GWh in 2013 to 310,410 GWh in 2017 (Department of 
Energy South Africa (DoE SA) 2013). Furthermore, this trend is expected to continue to record a growth of 34% by 
2030 with increase from 310,410 GWh in 2017 to 416,410 GWh in 2030 (DoE SA 2013). Similarly, the grid peak 
load follows an increase pattern with growth of 37% from 37,500 MWh in 2017 to 61,596 MWh in 2030 (DoE SA 
2013). 
There are a limited number of solutions to meet the dramatic expansion of electricity demand. Most of contemporary 
solutions rely on the conventional idea of increasing the supply to match the demand by investing in new electrical 
power stations. Currently, the total installed electricity generation capacity in South Africa is about 50 GWh which is 
expected to expand up to 82 GWh by 2030, a growth of 64% (DoE SA 2013). Figure 1 shows the trends of annual 
electricity consumption, grid peak load, and generation capacity in South Africa from 2013 to 2030 (DoE SA 2013).  
Due to the continual expansion in electricity generation capacity, the total CO2 emissions from the electricity sector 
in South Africa is expected to increase by around 20% from 266 million tons in 2013 to 319 million tons in 2025 (DoE

5. Conclusion 
The majority of the literature in the EGMP considers fixed and aggregated demand and capacity over the year. 
However, the electricity demand and generation capacity are dynamic parameters in hourly and/or daily basis. This 
paper proposed a linear programming model for the optimal EGMP to meet a specified CO2 emission target. The 
objective function minimizes the weighted sum of two terms: the EGC and the CO2EC. The model was solved 
optimally with a case study based on the electricity sector 2030 plan in South Africa. Solving the proposed model at 
two weighting scenarios resulted in two generation-mix plans; a minimum EGC driven generation-mix and a minimum 
CO2EC driven generation-mix. The former is with a lower EGC by around 6.45% while the latter is with lower CO2EC 
and CO2DE by around 4.41%. Both could eliminate the CO2DE, compared to the CO2DL, by around 18% and 22%, 
respectively. Furthermore, the minimum CO2EC driven generation-mix results in lower CO2HE over the day by 
around 1,136.15 ton per hour compared to the minimum EGC driven generation-mix. Further analysis may investigate 
the performance of the model at different points and the most compromise point is to be identified. Future extension 
to this model may focus on developing a stochastic model to consider the uncertainty in demand and renewable energy 
sources, and variations in prices.

Abstract 
This paper addresses the residential load scheduling problem with the objective of investigating the influence of price 
and CO2 signals in (i) the electricity bill, (ii) the consumer inconvenience, (iii) the electric peak load, and (iv) the CO2 
emissions. These objectives were considered widely in the literature; however, they were not considered 
simultaneously in one model before. Furthermore, CO2 emissions targets constraint was not considered in the previous 
literature. This paper contributes by twofold. First, the CO2 signal is drawn up based on the proposed generation-mix 
plan in South Africa and an hourly CO2 emissions limit is guaranteed. Second, a multi-objective mixed integer 
programming model is proposed, and a preemptive multi-objective optimization approach is applied. The model is 
tested with and without considering the hourly CO2 emissions limit. Furthermore, the model is solved at four scenarios 
to explore the effect of the price and CO2 signals and the order of optimization. Results showed that the price and CO2 
signals and the order of optimization have remarkable effect on the appliance schedule and on the four objectives.

1. Introduction
Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions are increasing exponentially all over the world. For example, the total CO2 emissions 
in South Africa recorded a dramatic increase of around 400% from 98 million tons in 1960 to 490 million tons in 2014 
(The World Bank 2018). Figure 1 shows the total CO2 emissions profile in South Africa from 1960 to 2014 (The 
World Bank 2018). 
One of the main sources of CO2 emissions in South Africa is the electricity sector due to the continuous expansion in 
electricity generation capacity. According to the Integrated Resource Plan for electricity sector in South Africa 2010-
2030 (IRP-2010) (DoE SA 2013), the electricity sector generates around 45-50% of national CO2 emissions. In 2013, 
the electricity sector generated around 266 million tons of CO2 emissions in South Africa and this number is expected 
to climb to 319 million tons in 2025 (DoE SA 2013).   
South Africa has set a target to limit CO2 at 550 million tons per annum starting 2025, which makes eliminating CO2 
emissions a critical and urgent issue (DoE SA 2013). Thus, the CO2 emission target for the electricity sector in South 
Africa is established as 275 million tons per annum in the IRP-2010.

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, an MOMILP optimization model is proposed to address the RLSP while considering price and CO2 
signals. The proposed model aimed to optimize appliance load schedules in terms of the EB, the IC, the EPL, and the 
CO2 emissions. The model considered an hourly CO2 emissions limit, which was defined based on the yearly CO2 
emissions target in South Africa. The effect of considering the hourly CO2 emissions limit was investigated and results 
showed that applying an hourly CO2 emission limit could reduce the EPL significantly and could eliminate the CO2 
emissions as well. Furthermore, the effect of the price and CO2 signals and the order of optimization on the resulting 
appliance schedules was explored. The price and CO2 DR signals, and the order of optimization over the four 
objectives could lead to very different appliances schedules with drastically different EB, IC, EPL and CO2 emission. 
These results emphasized that the hourly CO2 signal could give consumers an extra environmental motivation toward 
DR programs. Future work may focus on getting more compromise solutions for all objectives by applying different 
multi-objective optimization approaches, as well as uncertainties in appliance duration is to be considered.

Abstract 
In this paper, we develop an ontology-based performance evaluation system for a news search engine (called TAKA) 
using the enterprise engineering approach Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). This 
paper has threefold objectives. First, to describe, understand and analyze the main processes in 
TAKA news search engine. For this objective, a conceptual DEMO model is developed for TAKA system. Second, 
to propose a performance evaluation system for TAKA system. For this objective, a set of measures is developed for 
each 
process. 
Third, 
to 
analyze 
the 
performance 
and 
to 
draw 
potential 
improvements 
for 
the TAKA news search engine. For this objective, each process is analyzed, and corrective decisions are to be 
considered. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting a performance evaluation system for the entire 
news search engine from user, enterprise and systems engineering point of views. On contrast, studies in the literature 
consider only the users' perspectives.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background and Motivation
The number of online news sources has augmented vividly in the last decade. Today, an increasing number of people
are reading news online which is mostly free and easily accessible. Furthermore, many kinds of information are
sensitive to time, especially the case with news. In fact, the value of a news article depends much on its time of
publication. A more important reason for online news popularity is that people can access breaking news articles as
soon as they are posted. Furthermore, old news that may not be readily available from newspapers can be obtained.
However, the availability of large amount of online news overwhelms news-consumers. Moreover, because the 
enormous number of news sources, specialized news sites, and with the huge amount of online news; a news article 
of interest to a person may be posted in a newspaper web site unknown to him/her. 
News search engines are introduced as a solution to those issues. They aim to deliver news in an effective (according 
to consumer needs) and efficient (effortless) manner. They equipped with a wide range of tools which facilitate 
browsing news. With search tool, they can return fresh and relevant news in response to a news query. Moreover, their 
filtering capabilities deliver latest news according to consumers’ interest. Such systems enable news-consumers 
creating their own aggregated online newspapers to receive news from multiple sources. They allow users to search 
news articles from several news sources around the world from a single search system. Their inclusive, diverse, and 
neutral manner is another reason for the popularity of news engines.

Table 5 summarizes the KPIs values for the Articles Analyzing Process. This process aims to analyze the aggregated 
news articles in order to classify them accordingly based on the news categories (as shown in figure 4), locations, 
interrelated sets of articles, breaking news, and relevant to a particular user’s inquiries. This set of KPIs measures the 
accuracy of classifying and clustering the fetched news. Results show that the percentage of articles that clustered in 
a wrong cluster/category is about 30%. The percentage of combined sub-clusters or sub-topics in a cluster/topic is 
about 16%. This means that the total number of the clustered topics could be increased by 16%. This could be achieved 
by clustering the sub-clusters that found in a cluster to separate additional clusters. For example, in technology news, 
a cluster about “New features” is found. However, analysis showed that this cluster could be sub-classified to sub-
clusters, where one individual cluster for the new features news for each app or software. Results also show that there 
are about 30% of news are located to a false or not-accurate nearby location. It is important to mention that the topic 
modelling and clustering algorithms are still under research and development in TAKA system. Applying the proposed 
performance evaluation system enabled us to emphasis the shortage in this process performance. However, TAKA 
technical teams are targeting improving the performance of this process very shortly.

4.3. Discussion 
Generally, the evaluation results show that TAKA system performs well in most functions. However, during the study, 
we did observe number of strengths, weaknesses and challenges, which are discussed as below. 
Applying the proposed performance evaluation system enabled us to identify and detect the performance shortages in 
each of the four processes. Furthermore, it enabled the traceability of those issues. Root cause analysis is conducted 
to investigate the reasons behind those shortages. Then, a set of corrective and proactive actions are taken to handle 
those issues. TAKA technical teams are targeting to automate the traceability system to be able to detect, analyze, 
investigate and take actions for any of those issues could exist in TAKA system. 
Moreover, applying the proposed performance evaluation system emphasized the challenges of analyzing Arabic texts 
in comparison with other languages like, i. e., English. This issue is one of our main concerns because we target the 
Middle East market. The Arabic language, as a natural language, is more challenging in clustering and topic modelling 
rather than other languages. This could be explained due to the different writing styles and the lack of standards. 
It is important to mention that results, in particularly Figure 5, show that media focuses a lot in politics and less about 
health, environmental and technology. This could raise different research questions about the interrelationship 
between the media main concerns and the development of our life. 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper, an ontology-based performance evaluation system for TAKA system is developed. The enterprise 
engineering approach DEMO is applied to describe, understand and analyze the main processes in TAKA system. 
Then, a performance evaluation system is proposed for TAKA system by developing a set of KPIs for each process. 
The paper contribution is to present a performance evaluation system for the entire news monitoring system from user, 
enterprise and systems engineering point of views. On contrast, studies in the literature consider only the users' 
perspectives. This study enabled us to identify and detect the performance shortages in each of the four processes. 
Furthermore, it enabled the traceability of those issues. Moreover, it emphasized the challenges of analyzing Arabic 
texts. It is also showed that media focuses a lot about politics and less about technology. Future work may focus on 
tackling those issues. Next, we may analyse the media main focus in each country/region and investigate the 
interrelationship between the media main concerns and the development.

Abstract 
 
For a company in the traditional manufacturing environment, such as a machine tool industry, 
how to adjust the workforce assignment during adopting lean production is a key issue. 
Consiering the complexity in manufacutirng various machine types, each requires a combination 
of the expertise in multiple techniques for one specific technician, arrange appropriate workforce 
is therefore not an easy job for the shop floor manager. This work proposes a systematic method, 
based on the mathematical programming, to resolve the issue of workforce assignment when 
receiving small-volume, large-variety orders in the machine tool industry. A case company is 
used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. The proposed method starts 
with the drawing of Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and applies the seven principles of lean to 
design the to-be production system. An interger programming (IP) model is formed to find the 
optimal workforce assignment in re-designing the manufacturing process when various orders 
are received for the future VSM. Simulation results illustrate the potential performance of the 
model. A typical company which was quite representive in the machine tool industry was 
selected and its shop floor information was collected. For the case company, it was found out 
that the makespan could be reduced from 28.03 days to 12.5 days without additional manpower 
for a series of five orders with four machine types. The emprical results clearly demonstate that 
the proposed method is feasible and could be extended to other companies.

1. Introduction 
A machine tool is, in usual, heavy, large and difficult to move. It is assembled at a fixed position 
and the technicians work in turn according to their specific techniques such as scarping, accurate 
calibration, and laser calibration. It takes a while for a novice engineer to learn and practice the 
skills and act like an experienced worker. There are huge differences on the performance of 
workforces based on their experiences. Since the machine tool industry has the characteristics of 
multi-specification, small batch production model, and make to order, automation is therefore 
very difficult. On the other hand, lean production is a common practices in this type of the 
industry. Considering a company that is transforming toward lean manufacturing, this work 
proposes a systematic method, based on the integer programming model and lean thinking, to 
resolve the issue of workforce assignment in the machine tool industry. 
 
Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a tool that assists managers to understand the situation of the 
production line. The VSM can be used to improve the flow of information and materials thereby

Figure 2. VSM of the case 
 
The simulation results of future VSM showed that should the workforce assignment were 
arranged as planned, the employee utilization rate could be improved from 41.4% to 91.6% and 
the make-span could be reduced from 28.03 to 12.5 days. This demonstrates the importance to 
apply the IP model in making lean production practical in the machine tool industry.

4. Conclusion 
Machine tool industry is a very traditional yet very important industry. To be competitive, lean 
manufacturing is common practices in this industry.  However, the workforce arrangement is a 
very difficult problem for the practitioners.  This work proposes the combination of VSM and IP

Abstract 
This research was carried out through a methodology to diagnose and improve the work organization, based 
on methods engineering tools and time study. A case study was carried out in the floriculture company in 
La Esperanza-Ibarra, Ecuador. With the aim of increasing productivity, optimizing working methods and 
setting standards of time and performance. The bibliographical review allowed us to support the theoretical 
and scientific bases concerning the engineering of methods and study of times necessary to carry out the 
Investigation. With a diagnosis of the company case study, through tools of diagrams of processes and 
routes, were able to visualize the activities in each one of the workstations of the post-harvest area, such as: 
reception of roses, take off leafs, classification, bunch, cutting of stems, quality control and packaging. In 
addition, the times were taken in each of the operations of the operations of the above processes. According 
to the data obtained from the diagnosis, the company carried out a production of 11 893 stems per day 
according to the limiting capacity, for a demand of 12 500. As a result, improvements were made in the 
physical distribution of the post-harvest area, the standardization of times and with it, time and performance 
standards, and working methods are proposed. All the above proposed would allow us to achieve a decrease 
of cycle time from 2.01 minutes to 1.79 minutes per unit, estimating as a result the increase in production 
capacity to 13 400 stems per day, and increasing productivity by 12.67%; achieving the main objective of 
this case study.

4. Discussion 
The present study covers: the design, formulation and selection of the best methods, processes, tools and equipment 
needed to process a product in the post-harvest area of the company floriculture. 
 
Method engineering aims to optimize the way to perform a task or activity, eliminating unproductive working times 
and methods that do not add value to the post-harvest process. In addition, this standardization of tasks is achieved by 
studying the time needed to carry out this Activity. The best method must be linked to the best techniques or skills 
available, in order to achieve an efficient human-machine interrelation and thus increase the level of productivity.   
 
The procedure used for the organization of work allowed us to know through an organizational diagnosis, the current 
performance of the company and identify the productivity reserves that could be exploited. This tool used is very easy 
to apply and at the same time very flexible, because it could be applied to any type of organization. It not only guides 
us, it also provides us with techniques to obtain Information.  
 
It is essential that all areas be committed to the improvement and objective of research in the company. To follow the 
proposed working method, as well as the specific standard times of each one of the processes, as this will help to 
reduce unproductive times, production planning with less uncertainty, Increase of production capacity and 
productivity for the company. 
 
It is recommended to extend this study to all the processes of the company, to achieve a better organizational 
performance in the company. It is necessary to equip personal protective equipment in case it is impossible to act on 
the source, according to the need of the process in such a way that it helps the worker to carry out his activities in a 
more efficient way in safe conditions. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The procedure for the organization of the work that was used to support the investigation allowed making an effective 
diagnosis to focus the problems detected in the company under study. A time study was conducted to determine the 
standard weather with the initial method, resulting 1.89 min by bunch (25 stems), which reveals a reserve of 
productivity exploited of 6.75%. It was proposed an improvement in the distribution of the jobs with which was 
achieved the optimization of spaces and reduction of the distance that travels the worker in the operating cycle of 
about 58.7 to 48.8 meters. By proposing, the rotation of workers for jobs is expected to reduce monotony’s at work 
and would reduce time by supplements, which would help reduce the standard time from 2.02 min/u to 1.79 min/u. 
With the implementation of these organizational technical measures would be achieved increase production to 13 400 
stems/day and meet the demand of 12 500 stems/day. The new working method would increase productivity by 12.67 
%.

Abstract 
Inspection lines are a heavy duty yet expensive part in many industries such as wireless 
communication industry, auto industry. While inspection is always a necessary evil in a very 
complicated and competitive industry, there is a strong need to reduce the unnecessary inspection 
processes and resources to improve the competitiveness. This work develops a framework to 
apply big data analytics to improve the inspection processes based on case study method. A 
world class case company is selected and the data-warehouse is established for a specific lot of 
products. After the data pre-processing work, the relationships among the detection stations and 
the detection results could be found. Various meta-models are used, which including association 
rule method to find the correlation between different test items and to reduce the number of 
required tests.  Decision tree is also applied to find the optimal controllable factor. Finally, the 
developed rules are further verified by empirical data. Based on the empirical results, the number 
of detection items could be reduced by around 16.2% - a huge cost saving. It is also found out 
that the critical control factors, recommended by the decision tree, are temperature and humidity, 
which is a way to improve its quality without extra cost. The proposed big data application 
framework is therefore feasible in this case and machine learning or other models could be 
further extended, which is the future research direction.

1. Introduction
Inspection is a very complicated process for the information and communication industry (ICT),
auto industry, airline industry, and many consumers-oriented industries.  To main the quality,
there are many specifications and standards are proposed and the companies have to spend many
resources to verify the quality of the products. Many managers therefore argue that the
manufacturing cost of each equipment could be dramatically reduced should some of the
inspection process and/or related resources could be simplified. In practices, the settings of
process parameters and the complexity of process combinations are difficult to predict and could
simply by the experience of process engineers (Kudyba, 2014). In the modern era, Sarkar (2017)
pointed out the potential of using big data, while Acharjya and Ahmed (2016) stated that there is
currently no standard architecture that can solve all big data problems. This work proposes a big
data analysis framework, considering the complex characteristics of manufacturing processes,
and select a representative company in the WLAN industry to illustrate the feasibility of this
framework.

(6). Interpretation and verification of results  
The association rule results of the first part are provided to the domain experts to justify the 
validity of the rules. A total of 10 rules were extracted and verified by another empirical data. 
Comparison is shown in Table 5. The reliability is used as the verification standard. The error of 
rule 4 is 0, which means the reliability is consistent. It can be verified that proposed new rules 
can reduce the number of detections by around 16.2%. 
 
After the above analysis is completed, the decision tree analysis, the decision tree model is put 
into the test data for verification, and to identify further operation parameters details. The output 
correctness rate of the binary confusion matrix is 0.95 (see Table 6) which is quite good.

5. Conclusion 
In this work, a big data analysis framework is proposed to solve the complicated empirical 
problem in a case company. Various methods, including association rules and decision tree 
method are used to develop an improved production model. Through a six step process, 
association rules are developed and can roughly reduce the detection time by 16.2%. The model 
is further verified by another empirical data to illustrate its feasibility. This study also finds out

Abstract 
Total lead time of complete readymade garments depends on the sum of individual processing lead time such as 
spinning, knitting, dyeing, finishing, all over printing, cutting, screen printing, embroidery, sewing, washing, 
packaging etc. In this work, process of receiving of input to delivery of output of Screen Printing Industry is studied. 
Quality Control Circle approach is used to find out the possible causes for which print delay of quality printing 
happens. Total Quality Management tools are applied to modify the working process which results significant 
reduction of lead time inside the factory which is applicable for all screen printing processes of RMG sector.  Effect 
of reducing printing lead time is calculated in terms of monetary value for validation of the implementation of 
developed model. 
Key Words: Screen Printing, Quality Control Circle, Lead Time, TQM 
1. Introduction:
In this competitive business era, selling price need to be kept minimum to earn the competitive business advantage. 
Following cost leadership strategy in the global market, to be successful in business there is no other alternative other 
than reducing overall operating cost. Operating cost can be controlled by maintaining minimum lead time, reducing 
excess manpower, developing scientific management production process etc. Larger lead time is a costly exercise, 
generally regards this as primary evil from managerial point of view. Delivering the buyers order within the committed 
lead time plays a vital role to establish a long term business relationship with the buyers. Therefore, only by reducing 
the lead time of individual processing unit the total lead time of readymade garments can be reduced. The objective 
of this research work is to develop an ideal model for screen printing industry production process which ensures 
minimum lead time, man power effective utilization and scientific production process. Modified screen printing 
process of developed model is applied to Thanbee Print World Ltd. and cost benefit analysis is calculated to verify 
the developed model. Reducing lead time by modified screen printing process also results a reduction of operating 
cost of the industry. 
2. Literature Review:
Based on the data of Emirati airline companies, there is a positive relationship between TQM and the organizational 
performance (OP), reached to a decision by (Androwis, Sweis et al. 2018). TQM implementation improves customer 
satisfaction, the economy of an organization, and superior management of workers within companies (Malik, Banerjee 
et al. 2018). The nine constructs of TQM implementation are Top management commitment & involvement, Policy 
deployment with process control & improvement, Research and development, training & education, maintaining

Abstract 
The development of post-consumer polymers suppliers is defined as any effort made by the buyer company 
to its suppliers, to improve their performance or capacity, which guarantees the fulfillment of the supply in 
the short or long term. The main objective of the study is to improve the performance of matter that is 
outside impurity and density specifications through criteria of selection, intervention and evaluation of 
suppliers. These criteria were implemented with the following method: identification of needs for 
improvement of raw material by the final recycler, establishment of criteria for the evaluation of suppliers, 
intervention of suppliers, evaluation of results and development of a program of monitoring suppliers. At 
the end of the intervention, 12.5% of impurities were reduced and 400% density was increased, which 
caused an average increase of 8% in the raw material yield factor of the final recycler.

1. Introduction
Recycling in the Ecuador has increased in recent years due to the increase of solid waste generated by the consumer 
society, as well as by the increase in prices of imported raw materials for the industry, these variables have led to the 
companies are interested in buying significant volumes of recycled materials such as PET, paper, cardboard and scrap. 
The increase in collection that has had products recycled in the period from the year 2012 to 2014, is 170% in the case 
of the PET which passes from 28.402 to 48.384 tons per year. This growth is due to the incentive of the national 
Government, the adoption of the ""law of promoting environmental and optimization of the income of the State"", 
published in the supplement of the registry official No. 583 of November 24, 2011. In this, the redeemable tax to the 
non-returnable plastic bottles was established, this means the internal revenue service to pay two cents per bottle 
collected to centers of collection or companies accredited by the Ministry of the environment and certified by the 
Ministry of industries and productivity  (Ministerio del Ambiente, 2015). The redeemable tax non-returnable plastic 
bottles are a green tax which is based on the principle of polluter pays. This is intended to transfer the costs of 
environmental protection to the players causing pollution, which can be companies or consumers (Perez, 2016) 
The recycling cycle that currently operates in the Ecuadorian market has a diversity of activities, actors and processes. 
The actors that are linked in the recycling system are: final consumer, primary recycler or manager, collection center 
or intermediary and final recycler, and finally the industry. The case analyzed is the final recycler, which are all 
industries that transform the recyclable raw materials from the collection centers by mechanical and chemical means. 
Which become new virgin or degraded raw materials, which are used for the development of new consumer goods 
(Organización Internacional del Trabajo, 2013). 
The final recyclers process the post-consumer polymers to obtain scale, through the following activities: separation of 
plastic waste, crushing, washing and drying of flake or flake (Vázquez et al., 2013). This production process does not 
comply with 80% yield because post-consumer polymers have a large amount of impurities and low density, therefore, 
it is identified that the lack of development of post-consumer polymers suppliers directly impacts the performance of 
the production process. The strategy of improving productivity in the manufacture of goods and services by companies

After the intervention, increases are observed from June to September of the year. The average value of the yield of 
raw material, consumed by the process in the last three months is 83%. With the base exposed, it can be said that the 
registration of the before and after the intervention in the collection centers has been made Quito - Guamaní, and 
Esmeraldas - Atacames. With results of: 2.5% PET bottle impurities, and 83% of raw material consumed. 
 
It is recommended to extend this study to all the processes of the company, to achieve a better organizational 
performance in the company. It is necessary to equip personal protective equipment in case it is impossible to act on 
the source, according to the need of the process in such a way that it helps the worker to carry out his activities in a 
more efficient way in safe conditions. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The raw material of the process did not meet the specifications of 3% impurity and 150 to 300 kg / m³ density. The 
results obtained are: 15% impurity, and 50 kg / m³ density in bulk post-consumer polymers. 
 
Criteria were established for the evaluation of collection centers, which are: quality, technological capacity, production 
capacity and facilities, and relationship / cooperation capacity. With which the following supplier locations were 
selected: Esmeraldas - Atacames, and Quito - Guamaní. 
 
The selected collection centers were intervened with machinery and improvement activities. In the first, it was 
equipped with two presses and manual selection bands. For the second, the activities of selection, classification and 
pressing of post-consumer polymers were implemented. With which the results of 2% in impurity and 202 kg / m³ in 
density for the bales made from bulk polymers were obtained. Therefore, the raw material specifications of the final 
recycler were met. After the intervention, an average of 8% of the post-consumer polymers performance factor or 
partial productivity of the process raw material was increased. 
 
As a method of evaluating results to developed suppliers, the characterization of two bales per shipment received at 
the plant was determined. And because it is a long-term objective, the follow-up program for developed suppliers was 
raised.

Abstract 
In this paper, a nonlinear mathematical model of unemployment is described and analyzed for reduction of 
unemployed persons using two controls ‘creation of new vacancies’ and ‘skilled manpower’. For maximization of 
the number of employed people at the end of implemented policy, we find the control profile of two controls using 
Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle. This study concludes two effective controls so that the number of unemployed 
persons at the end of implemented policies of the government is minimized while minimizing the systematic cost of 
policy making. Our numerical results as illustrated in the figures strongly agree with the analytical findings.

1. Introduction
Unemployment problems have become the most immense concerns all over the world. This issue is significantly an 
alarming concern in Bangladesh as well. Unemployment can be defined as a state of workless for a person, who is 
fit, capable and willing to work. It is well known that the main reason for socio-economic damage, deletion of 
morality and social values is unemployment. With the increasing tendency of unemployed population in a country 
significantly affects the other factors, such that the income per person, health costs, quality of healthcare and poverty 
and seriously hamper the growth of national economy.  In this paper, we propose a nonlinear mathematical model to 
assess the unemployment problems in Bangladesh. Optimal control techniques have been applied by introducing two 
controls, viz. ‘creating new vacancies’ and ‘providing skilled manpower’, in the proposed model to reduce the 
unemployed persons. The model has been analyzed both analytically and numerically. The analytical findings have 
been validated with the numerical simulations. According to World Employment Social Outlook of ILO in 2017, 
Global unemployment levels and rates are predicted to remain high in the short term, as the global labour force 
continues to grow. In particular, the global unemployment rate is predicted to rise modestly in 2017 to 5.8 per cent 
(from 5.7 per cent in 2016) representing 3.4 million more unemployed people globally (bringing total 
unemployment to just over 201 million in 2017). So unemployment is one of the most serious issues for every 
country.  
Several authors have contributed to different mathematical models to analyze and design optimal control strategies 
for unemployment problem. According to most of them, the population of developing countries has increased 
enormously but new opportunities for employment have not increased in the same proportion. So creating new 
opportunities is a priority for any vibrant economy. In 2011, assuming all entrants to category of the unemployed are 
fully qualified and competent to do any job, Misra and Singh (2013; 2011) discussed and analyzed a system of 
nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the control of unemployment. It is also considered that the number of 
unemployed persons increases continuously at a constant rate. Having motivated by (Misra and Singh 2011), Pathan 
and Bhatahwala (2015) proposed a model for reduction of unemployment problem with self-employment. In that 
model, they considered no time delay by government and private sector in creating new vacancies. In 2016, Munoli 
and Gani (2016) proposed an unemployment model and discussed the optimality conditions for optimal solutions of

 at final time. Since the number of unemployed persons are near to the vacancies but greater. So, it is a 
desirable situation for any nation. In Fig. 7, we see that the adjoint of states satisfies the transversality condition of 
the optimal control problem. Because adjoint of states are zero at final time. So, the Fig. 7 ensures the completeness 
of optimal solution of the problem with the control profiles (see Fig. 5).  
In Table 2, the objective functional is maximized for controlling of both policies of government to reduce the 
unemployed persons. So we decide that the control of both policies is better than no control of that policies. From 
this point, we believe that these control strategies can effectively reduce the unemployed persons in developing 
country after implementation of both policies of government. Hence we belive that the numerically analyzed control 
strategies of our proposed model can effectively reduce the unemployed population in the society.

6. Conclusions 
 
We have presented a mathematical model on unemployment introducing new vacancies and trained persons to 
reduce unemployed persons with maximization of objective functional using Pontryagin’s maximum principle. After 
successful implementation of the policy of government, it is clear that the value of objective functional is maximized 
with the minimization of unemployed persons. We decide that the control of policies of government is more 
effective for maximization of objective functional with the minimization of unemployed persons than the no control 
of both policies. Hence, we believe that the numerically analyzed control profile of our proposed model can 
effectively reduce the unemployed persons in a country.

Abstract 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a powerful tool for decision making. In this paper, we present an 
application of AHP used for product recommendation to assist customers in selecting power equipment for 
studio recording. The application is implemented in Microsoft Excel in an interactive manner where customers 
are asked to answer questions related to product requirements and customer preferences. The customer 
information is combined with the predefined judgments from the experts according to a given set of criteria for 
product selection. The score for each product is then calculated according to the AHP, and the top three products 
with the highest score are recommended for the customer. The proposed method is tested by the customers and 
the results are discussed.

1. Introduction
In studio recording, the power unit plays an essential role in proper operations of recording equipment and in
recording high-quality audio. Many electrical issues could significantly affect the recording sound quality, 
interrupt the recording process, or even damage the recording equipment. For examples, switching on or off an 
electrical equipment could generate electrical noise interfering audio recording, lightning strike could cause 
voltage surges in the power lines which could potentially damage the studio equipment, power outage from 
short circuit could interrupt the recording process, etc. Therefore, a power unit with exclusive features such as 
noise filtering and surge protection is very crucial for studio recording.   
Selecting a right power unit is not an easy task. Product selection is often a time consuming process which 
may require buyer to read many reviews of the related products. Furthermore, some reviews may involve 
technical knowledge which is hard to understand especially for customers who do not have strong background. 
This happens for choosing many technical products not only for finding a suitable power unit for studio 
recording.  
Due to the needs for exclusive features, there are many decision criteria involved in selecting a power unit 
that is best suit for user requirements. These features include noise filtering, surge protection, voltage regulation, 
energy storage capability, etc. The combination of numerous features often makes user confuse when selecting a 
potential product. To assist customer selecting the right product, product recommendation techniques are often 
used in today’s rapidly growing e-commerce market. Despite to many techniques used in this area, the Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) is one of the well-known decision making tools which is used around the world in a 
wide variety of applications. 
This paper addresses the issues of selecting a power unit for studio recording as a multi criteria decision 
making problem by applying the AHP in an interactive way. The AHP provides a systematic procedure in 
evaluating the alternatives for a given set of criteria regarding to the usage in studio recording. The interactive 
approach allows customer to adjust his/her requirements accordingly based on the set of available products. By 
using the information from customer inputs and the predefined judgments from the experts, products are ranked 
to identify the alternative that best suits the customer requirements.

From Table 8, we observed that the results can be divided into three different cases. Case 1, results from 
customer number 2, 3, and 8, the recommendations from the model agree with those from the expert. Case 2, 
result from customer number 1, the model and expert give different product recommendation. Case 3, results 
from customer number 4, 5, 6, and 7, the model cannot find any qualified product for the customer where the 
expert suggests a combination of products to the customer.  
In case 1, the recommended products for customers number 2 and 3 match exactly with the 
recommendations from the experts. For customer number 8, the model suggests one additional product for the 
customer in addition to the recommendations of the expert. This is simply because the model is assigned to 
provide three suggestions and there are more than two products that qualified for this customer.  
In case 2, the model recommends three products that are in a lower price range to customer number 1, while 
the expert suggest PL-PRO DMC E which has a higher price. This is because the expert try to suggest a high-
end product to the customer that may over qualified for his requirements but still within his budget constraint. 
Further investigation shows that the PL-PRO DMC E is ranked fourth in the alternatives. If the customer would 
lower his budget, than the recommendation of the expert will definitely be any of the three alternatives in the 
list.  
The results in the third case reveal the limitation of our model where the model is only capable of 
recommending a single product but not the combination of the products. To address this issue, the set of 
alternative can be extended to include the combination of products and the Analytic Network Process (ANP) can 
be used for our model improvement. Similar to the AHP, the ANP uses a network to represent the structure of 
the decision making process and allows interdependence among the decision criteria and the alternatives.  
Another shortcoming of the model is that some features are used for filtering the requirements of the 
products but not considered in the decision criteria. As a result, the product with additional features that are not 
required by the customer will not preferable over the products that do not have such features. We can further 
improve the model by taking into account these additional features in the decision criteria.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we propose an interactive AHP decision model for recommending power unit used in studio 
recording. Questionnaire is used to gather customer requirements for the product. This information is coupled 
with the predefined judgments from the experts to justify the products that best suit for the customer 
requirements. The evaluation result shows that the recommendation from the model is reasonable in 
circumstances where a single product is recommended. Model improvement can be focus on how to handle 
recommendation for product combinations as well as extend the functional requirements of the decision criteria.

Abstract 
Unhealthy employees are inclined to be absent from work and tend to have low job performance and 
productivity. Among the most cited causes of employees’ illness are Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) and 
stress. However, empirical evidence on the effects of ventilation, temperature, lighting and noise and 
stress on Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) are inconsistent and fragmented in nature. The combined effects 
of both physical environment and psychological state of stress on SBS have not been investigated in 
tandem with each other. Therefore, this study focused on effects of physical aspects of workplace in terms 
of ventilation, temperature, lighting and psychological aspect in terms of stress on Sick Building 
Syndrome (SBS). Gender and age were controlled as these variables were often regarded to have spurious 
effects on the relationship among constructs. Data were collected via self-administered survey among 447 
manufacturing employees. It is found that only temperature and stress have significant effects (R2= 
62.6%) on SBS when age and gender were controlled. Stress has the highest Beta value which indicates 
stronger influence on SBS. The finding indicates the importance of both management and prevention of 
physical and psychological aspects of workplace for reducing occupational hazard such as SBS. However, 
stress might pose a greater risk for employees suffering from SBS.

5. Discussion and Conclusions 
 
The findings of this paper indicate the superior influence of psychological factors over working environment. In fact, 
this study indicates alignment with the Herzberg’s Two Factor Theory where the presence of motivator would 
improve job satisfaction while the absence of hygiene factors would lead not lead to more satisfaction. In a nutshell, 
the working environment must be conducive for working but its inadequacies would not lead to SBS unless severe. 
However, stress has far reaching effect and in fact might be the mediator between the link of work environment and 
stress. In fact Abdullah, Abdul Hamid, Amirul Shaif, Shamsuddin, & Wahab (2016) argued that there is a need to 
examine this interaction more closely.

Abstract 
Last mile logistics is the most time consuming and expensive stage of the delivery process. Facing the 
competitiveness of E-commerce with the rapidly fluctuating consumer demand is one of the biggest 
challenge faced by most of the companies. Further, last mile delivery performance became the most crucial 
factor of the relationship between e-commerce retailer and end customer as it can either establish or break 
the bond, which directly affects on the reordering decision of the customer. Therefore retailers exert 
pressure on last mile service providers to optimize their performance. The challenge lies in how last mile 
services providers should react to meet the requirements of increased parcel demand. Thus maintaining cost 
efficiency and high quality of the service is essential for last mile services providers to succeed in online 
business.  Unfortunately, most of the last mile strategies fail due to not conducting proper studies on the 
expectations of key parties; retailers, last mile service providers and customers. Resource utilization and 
service quality can be identified as two main aspects of last mile delivery which directly affect on the last 
mile delivery performance. This scrutiny focuses on eliminating the inefficiencies in last mile delivery by 
identifying the factors that should be considered when implementing a last mile strategy by analyzing the 
strengths and weaknesses of current practices through a qualitative analysis conducted using key parties 
engaged in last mile delivery in Sri Lanka. Further, this study focuses on proposing strategic improvements 
to the identified issues through a case study on a leading last mile services provider. The strategic model

Modeling and Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Concentration 
Emitted from the Coal-based Power Plant in Bangladesh

Abstract 
A coal based power plant is considered as one of the main sources of the emission of carbon dioxide, which is the 
principal etiological agent for climate change due to global warming, and thus poses great threat to the Sundarbans, 
the largest mangrove forest in the world and its surrounding regions because of a high emission rate of greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide. In this paper, we propose a nonlinear mathematical model to assess the 
emission of carbon dioxide, produced from the coal-based power plant  at Rampal in the Bagerhat district of 
Bangladesh and its possible aftermath on the ecosystem. We study the process using a three compartmental 
ecological model which is generally used for modeling dynamic ecosystems and process to assess the concentration 
of greenhouse gases like CO2. The model has been analyzed both analytically and numerically. The analytical 
findings have been validated with the numerical simulations.  
Keywords: Coal-based fuel, Carbon dioxide, Climate change, Mathematical model, Numerical simulation. 
1. Introduction
Coal based power plant produces electricity by burning coal in a boiler to heat water to produce steam. The steam, at 
tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine which spins a generator to produce electricity. The steam is cooled, 
condensed back into water, and returned to the boiler to start the process over. Burning coal is a leading cause of 
smog, acid rain, global warming, and air toxics. In an average year, a typical coal plant generates: )i( 3,700,000 tons 
of carbon dioxide )CO2(, the primary human cause of global warming--as much carbon dioxide as cutting down 161 
million trees; )ii( 10,000 tons of sulfur dioxide )SO2( which causes acid rain that damages forests, lakes, and 
buildings, and forms small airborne particles that can penetrate deep into lungs; )iii( 500 tons of small airborne 
particles, which can cause chronic bronchitis, aggravated asthma, and premature death, as well as haze obstructing 
visibility; )iv( 10,200 tons of nitrogen oxide )NO(, as much as would be emitted by half a million late-model cars. 
NO leads to formation of ozone )smog( which inflames the lungs, burning through lung tissue making people more 
susceptible to respiratory illness; )v( 720 tons of carbon monoxide )CO(, which causes headaches and place 
additional stress on people with heart disease; )vi( 220 tons of hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds )VOC(, 
which form ozone; )vii( 170 pounds of mercury, where just 1/70th of a teaspoon deposited on a 25-acre lake can 
make the fish unsafe to eat; )viii( 225 pounds of arsenic, which will cause cancer in one out of 100 people who drink 
water containing 50 parts per billion and )ix( 114 pounds of lead, 4 pounds of cadmium, other toxic heavy metals, 
and trace amounts of uranium.) Chowdhury 2017(. Coal plants are one of the top sources of carbon dioxide )CO2( 
emissions and the primary cause of global warming. Coal burning is one of the main causes of creating smog, acid 
rain, and toxic air pollution. Despite of these facts, the Bangladesh government planned for a 1320 megawatt coal-
based power station at Rampal in Bagerhat district of Bangladesh. This work is proposed as a joint partnership 
between India's state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation and Bangladesh Power Development Board. The 
joint venture company is known as Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company )BIFPC(. The proposed project, 
on an area of over 1834 acres of land, is situated 14 kilometers north from the edge of the world's largest mangrove 
forest Sundarbans which is a UNESCO world heritage site. Coal fired Rampal power plant planning is considered to 
be one of the most controversial decisions as this project has environmental issues. The crucial discussion about 
environmental security of Sundarbans is not satisfied yet. Regarding this we tried to find out the natural capability of 
Sundarbans to face environmental changes which will be implied by this plant. We tried to figure out the

4. Conclusions 
From the above solutions, analysis, numerical simulations and figures, we can conclude that the amount of carbon 
dioxide will increase instantly at Sundarbans but Because of having higher carbon dioxide absorption capacity, 
Sundarbans will absorb almost all the Carbon Dioxide slowly and there will exist only newly transported carbon 
dioxide at the environment of Sundarbans. Some carbon dioxide are transported to Bay of Bengal. If the rate of 
transportation to Bay of Bengal increases then Sundarbans have to absorb little amount of carbon dioxide and the 
level of carbon dioxide will be almost same here. But the carbon dioxide absorption capacity of Khulna-Bagerhat 
region is relatively very low than Sundarbans but carbon dioxide transportation takes some time here. Because of 
this, the amount of carbon dioxide will increase slowly if less carbon dioxide will enter here. Otherwise it will 
increase highly and become stable after a certain time period. At power plant’s environment, carbon dioxide will 
increase highly but get transported to various directions through air. Since transportation is a very slow process, 
there exist a big amount of carbon dioxide always around the power plant.

Abstract
PT. Harmoni Empat Selaras is a manufacturing company engaged in making racking systems and office needs. The 
company applies the make to order system in production process with job shop production flow, that is, production 
begins when there is an order coming in and processing the order production flow has a different process flow for 
each item. Erratic production scheduling in companies can increase the value of production makespan, and to reduce 
productivity and efficiency in similar industries. The  company manufacture the gondola rack products, with the result 
of  2760 seconds makespan production time. By paying attention to the existing provisions, in minimizing makespan 
time this research use taboo search algorithm method and active scheduling methods, by making the initial solution 
with the classical heuristic method. The scheduling proposal with the active scheduling algorithm produces makespan 
is 2194 seconds and the proposal with tabu search algorithm produces an makespan value is 2011 seconds. So it can 
be said that scheduling with tabu search algorithm method is more optimal than active scheduling algorithmSo from 
the results of the new scheduling found that  the decreasing of  the  gondola rack efficiency production makespan time 
by 27,1%.

Introduction
Currently the manufacturing industry is rapidly grow, seen from the number of new companies that started their own 
businesses in the industrial sector. The increasing number of manufacturing industry companies will certainly make a 
tight and competition, so  the company must have its own strategy in order to be trusted by every customer. Timely 
fulfillment of orders is a major factor in winning competition, and effective scheduling is the right method, besides 
being able to increase productivity and facility utilization (Ashwani & Pankaj, 2010). 
PT. Harmoni Empat Selaras is a manufacturing industry engaged in making racking systems and office 
equipment. Production scheduling in this company is uncertain and   having a job shop  production type. With the job 
shop process flow and the use of erratic production scheduling at PT. Harmoni Empat Selaras can cause a high 
production makespan time values. Also this can effect the waste in the production line, such as a wasteful amount of 
labor that has not been allocated well, thus making it difficult for companies to compete with similar industries.  
This research propose  to find a best production scheduling using the tabu search algorithm and active 
scheduling. Scheduling with this method aims to compare proposals from both methods and minimize makespan time 
so  the company can compete with other similar industries. 
2.
Literature Review
Production scheduling is defined as an allocation of time to carry out each job in order to complete the whole
project in achieving an optimal results by considering the limitations resources (Husen, A. 2009). Better
production scheduling will result in coordination better so it increases productivity and minimizes operational
costs (Guilherme et al., 2003).

Based on the results of research, the efficiency improvement obtained after rescheduling with the tabu search algorithm 
method is 27.1% with the following calculations: 
Efficiency =ቚ
(2011−2760) 
2760

Efficiency = 27,1 % 
The efficiency improvement obtained after rescheduling with the active scheduling algorithm method is 20.5% with 
the following calculations: 
Efficiency =ቚ
(2194−2760)

CONCLUSION 
Initial scheduling conducted by PT. Harmoni Empat Selaras still not optimal, shown by the makespan value which is 
still higher than the makespan value obtained using the tabu search algorithm method or active scheduling. 
 
From the results of the study it can be said that tabu search is a more optimal scheduling method compared to active 
scheduling methods and company methods because the tabu search method makes the makespan value of 2011 
seconds while the active scheduling method obtained makespan value of 2194 seconds and scheduling from the 
company amounted to 2760 seconds. 
 
So that the new scheduling with the tabu search method is more efficient 27,1% than the old company scheduling and 
scheduling with an active scheduling method is more efficient 20,5% compared to the old scheduling used by the 
company.

Abstract 
Assessing the integrity of corroded pipelines has long been and continues to be a concern for the industry. Over 
the years, several modifications to the original method have been proposed and adopted. In recent years, various 
methods for evaluating metal loss corrosion defects have been developed based on test data and safety factors. 
This article presents a comparison of the methods for evaluating corroded pipelines and comments on these 
different methods. 
The study is limited to corrosion defects and metal losses in pipelines exposed to internal pressure. 
The choice of points and methods of repair depending on the severity of the defects, or the degree of damage to 
the pipeline, can only be decided after having examined: 
a)
The consequences of the unavailability of the pipeline on the transport program,
b)
The economic aspect; (the desired transportation capacity, as it is the desired maximum service pressure that
will condition the repair plan,
The following types of repairs are encountered: Repair without production stoppage,  Repair with production 
stop. 
The presentation deals with the case of the study of a 164 km section of the OB1 pipeline linking Haoud El 
Hamra to Bejaia, 660 km long. The ERF calculation results (Estimated Repair Factor, following table) according 
to 2 criteria used (ASME B31G and modified B31G, gives us the opportunity to make a lot of comments as well 
as the opportunity to use the improved RSTRENG criterion.

Abstract 
Laser ablation of any solid target in the liquid leads to fabricate nanoparticles (NPs) with metal or different 
compositions of materials such as metals, alloys, oxides, carbides, hydroxides. The fabrication of NPs in liquids 
based on laser ablation has grown up rapidly in the last decades compared to other techniques. Nowadays, laser 
ablation has been improved to prepare a different types of NPs with special morphologies, microstructures, 
phases and sizes, which can be applied in various field. The paper reviews and highlights the different sizes, 
shapes and application field of nanoparticles that are produced by laser ablation under different liquids and 
materials. Also the paper provide a case study for producing a titanium NPs produced by laser ablation 
submerged in distilled water. The Size of NPs is an important parameter especially for their usage and 
applications. The size and shape has been analyzed by SEM, (EDAX) was applied to evaluate the oxidation 
and elements of titanium NPs and the XRD was used to evaluate the phase composition and the peaks of both 
titanium and some element. SEM technique showed that the synthesized NPs size ranges were between 15-35 
nm which can be applied in various field such as annihilator for cancerous cell etc.

1 Introduction 
In the last decades, the Nano-science has progressed, laser ablation (LA) become a one of the important technique for the 
synthesis of nanostructures. The laser ablation techniques of nanoparticles can be produced in two different  environments: in a 
vacuum, or gas or in a liquid (Zeng et al., 2012). Laser ablation of solids materials in liquids is a physical approach for NPs creation 
of various elements. The layer molten on the target material is created by laser pulse which can be dispersed around the liquid as 
NPs. The NPs made of composite materials that contain an alloy of  two  or more metals which has the ability to  produces a  NPs 
with stoichiometry which similar  to  the target alloy (Semaltianos, 2016). Nanoparticles (NPs) depends too much on the material 
and liquid type for their usage in various applications such as in chemistry, physics, engineering or biology. Moreover the size and 
shape of NPs can be controlled by selecting the appropriate material and liquid used (Semaltianos, 2016).

XRD presented the phase composition of the dried NPs which display the peaks of titanium. Figure 9 shows that, the titanium 
has some peaks which can be seen clearly. Several peaks of some elements are visible such as titanium oxide. The dried NPs can 
also have some portion of amorphous of titanium oxide, which is not visible in the XRD in the figure above.  
6 Conclusions and Recommendations  
 
The paper summarizes and highlights the different sizes, shapes and application field of nanoparticles prepared by laser 
ablation with various materials under different liquids. It can be concluded that, the Laser ablation is an efficient and appropriate 
technique that has the ability to produce NPs with different required sizes. The collected papers on NPs have been classified in into 
five categories: the size less than 50 nm, between 50-100 nm, between 100-200 nm, greater than 200 nm and others. Moreover, this 
research provides a case study for preparing a titanium NPs by laser ablation submerged in distilled water. The Size of NPs is an 
important parameter especially for their applications. The size and shape has been analyzed by SEM, and EDAX was applied to 
evaluate the oxidation and elements of titanium NPs. XRD was used to evaluate the phase composition of the titanium NPs. SEM 
technique showed that the synthesized NPs size ranges were between 15-35 nm which can be applied in various field.

Abstract 
This paper presents an automated control system act as machine to machine (M2M), without human intervention 
base on real time environment of temperature and soil moisture for irrigation in agriculture. Automatic control 
system is very practical in agriculture but most of it based on schedule and timer regardless of soil condition and 
temperature. Therefore, wireless automated irrigation system (WARIS) is proposed as a solution in agriculture 
for irrigation system to suit any crop. In order to build an effective system in farm, an embedded various 
technologies such as sensors, Zigbee 2.4GHz, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and the Automated Intelligent 
System are designed in farm to control the amount of water for each crop automatically. This intelligent system 
is very practical due to the design and development of the real time embedded system. This automatic control 
system can save about 50% of water and labor cost since it required only one farmer to control the whole farm if 
necessary.

1. Introduction
Water is a resource that all living species need. It is therefore very precious and has to be used in moderation to 
be preserved for the generation to come. Agriculture is an industry that uses a lot of water throughout the world. 
This resources should uses in an efficient way without affecting the crop production [1]. Most of the time, this 
resource is not used efficiently and substantial amount of water are wasted. Most of the farms are contributed 
from lack of monitoring and manual irrigation system. 
In the conventional irrigation system, the farmer has to watering their plants by follow a schedule for different 
crops [2]. The difficulties in monitoring and control the water usage by human control are the main factors in 
this situation. In line with this reason, this invention proposed an automated control irrigation system with full 
real time remote monitoring and control system to the crops in the farm. The system replaces the human-to- 
human (H2H) and human-to-machine (H2M) to machine to machine (M2M) architecture. These inventions 
aim to enhance the agriculture sector’s contribution by increasing the high quality of crop production with lower 
cost.

Figure 8. Comparison using manual and automatic irrigation 
 
Figure 8 shows data was collect over 6 month in farm by using manual irrigation and automatic. The test was 
setup at two difference area where area A is using manual irrigation while Area B is using proposed system. 
Each area have own tank to be measured every month. From the data collected, it can be summarize by using 
WARIS in the farm has huge benefits. Farmer can save a lot of money and water. Water usage can be reduced 
approximately up to 50 % when the embedded technology is used compared to manual method. 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The uses of WARIS as an automated real time control system for irrigation in farm had applied to growth the 
crop and save water by monitoring the soil moisture and delivering information for farmer to monitor. The 
farmer also can save more money by reducing water used and workers. Besides that, the use of WSN instead of 
the wired connection over the farm still function in any type of environment for monitoring the crops.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, we incorporate the idea of uncertainty in adoption process in innovation diffusion model in dynamic 
market. The diffusion process is sum of a deterministic component that is a function of cumulative adopters and a 
random fluctuation with intensity proportional to the cumulative adopters. The state of the system is modeled as a 
stochastic process which is governed by stochastic differential equation. The applicability and accuracy of model is 
illustrated by means of new product sales data. Predictive validity and mean square error have been used to check 
the validity of the proposed model.

1. Introduction  
 
The increased technical advancements have resulted in an outburst of production and flow of more goods and 
efficient services in the market. Globalization has played a major role in spreading consumer awareness, thereby 
making it essential for business firms to come up with new and better business ideas. With increased customer 
demands and expectations, there is a constant need of having new and more effective products. This process of 
creating something new and advanced is termed as innovation.  
 
Once the new idea or product is formalized, the next step is to make it acceptable to the population of the respective 
social system. This process is termed as diffusion of Innovation. Diffusion theory analyses the causes and the pace at 
which the new commodity or service is being adopted by the customers in a society. These customers constitute the 
potential adopter population. Prediction of the adoption rate of a new product by the potential customers of the 
social system has been a topic of research among researchers belonging to varied fields since 1960. The most basic 
and popular innovation diffusion model was given by Bass (1969). This model has been further enhanced to 
incorporate various cases. The diffusion process gets influenced by various factors. The four important variables 
being the innovation itself, the means of communication via which the information is conveyed to the potential 
customers, the rate at which the innovation is adopted by the population and the social system comprising of 
individuals and organisations.  
 
During the last few decades, the innovation diffusion models have been extensively studied and a considerable 
amount of research has been done by people from different fields like marketing, social sciences and economics 
(Easingwood, Mahajan and Muller, 1983; Mahajan and Peterson, 1985; Rogers, 1983). Numerous mathematical 
models have been given to study the process of diffusion of innovations which are also used for the purpose of 
prediction. Initially, the members of the potential adopter population are influenced by external factors to adopt the 
product. They are referred as innovators. Later through their word of mouth, they influence more individuals to 
adopt the product. These members who are influenced by internal factors are known as imitators.  
 
The initial steps to study the diffusion process were taken by Easingwood, Mahajan and Muller (1981, 1983), Floyd 
(1968), Lilien, Kotler and Moorthy(1998), Mahajan , Muller and Bass (1990), Mahajan and Peterson (1978) and 
Sharif and Ramanathan(1981). The models undertaken were broadly categorized on the basis of three types of

4. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
  
In this paper, we proposed an innovation-diffusion model to describe the effect of multiplicative noise in system that 
influences on adoption process. Most of the existing models in the literature assume absence of noise in adoption 
process while developing the model. Here, adoption rate process is sum of a deterministic component that is a 
function of cumulative adopters and a random fluctuation with intensity proportional to the cumulative adopters. 
The state of the system is modelled as a stochastic process which is governed by stochastic differential equation. Its 
applicability and accuracy is illustrated by means of new product sales data. Predictive validity and mean square 
error have been used to check the validity of the proposed model. We summarize the estimated values of parameters 
of the proposed model in Table 2. It can be seen that the proposed model describes the adoption growth and fits in 
all the three data sets. From the Table2, we have seen that proposed model fits best in data set DS-I and DS-III with 
lower value of MSE and R2 in comparison to data set DS-II.

Abstract 
PT. Plasindo Elok is a manufacturer that has been producing plastic protector and packaging system specifically 
for oil and gas company. All kinds of product which is produced by PT.Plasindo Elok, have the same sequences 
and at several production stages, there are a number of parallel machine with its different capacity (hybrid flow 
shop). The existing production scheduling was based on First Come First Serve (FCFS). The objective of this 
paper is to design a scheduling system to minimize makespan which could reduce WIP and total production cost. 
Flow shop heuristic method which is used as a basis to get the optimal makespan are NEH and CDS algorithm. 
Furthermore, the scheduling sequence of NEH and CDS are used to generate an initial sequence for metaheuristic 
method, Tabu Search (TS). The result of data processing showed that CDS algorithm represented the minimum 
makespan compared to NEH algorithm. The proposed methods CDS-TS and NEH-TS, produced the same 
minimum makespan, 14861,61 minutes with different mean flow time. Both hybrid algorithm (NEH-TS and 
CDS-TS) could reduce total makespan to 1697,93 minutes or 28,30 hours. The proposed method given to the 
company was NEH-TS with the production sequence of P10 - P12 - P13 - P8 - P7 - P4 - P5 - P2 - P1 - P11 - P9 
- P3 - P14 - P6, NEH-TS was the best algorithm compared to NEH, CDS, and CDS-TS because it produced the
least makespan and mean flow time. In addition to facilitate company scheduling calculation, researcher designs
a Java based scheduling program.

1. Introduction
Production process in a manufacturing company should be well manage to meet customer’s needs in terms of 
time and amount. Every company strives to have the most effective and efficient scheduling method in order to 
increase their productivity with a minimum cost and time. Errors and failures in scheduling will disrupt the 
production’s schedule and  affect many things such as lack of total amount of production, delays in meeting 
consumer needs, the amount of work-in-process goods, high production costs (labor, machinery, and electricity), 
and loss of sale. 
Scheduling problem was one of the problems faced by PT. Plasindo Elok. PT.Plasindo Elok applied a manual 
production scheduling system by an estimator in production subdivision, based on First Come First Serve 
(FCFS) method. Besides, estimator also needed to determine several jobs that must be prioritized because of 
customer orders. The estimator previously used their experience and personal considerations in performing 
production scheduling and also had some difficulties when customers increase their order’s number, so that 
some of the jobs with some different specifications needed to be rescheduled. 
PT. Plasindo Elok is classified as semi continuous production type because of large quantity of customer’s 
orders. In producing plastic thread and cup protector, PT. Plasindo Elok applies a production process flow in 
accordance with hybrid flow shop, which there are several machines such as resin mixer, injection molding, and 
CNC machine that operate parallely and production process for all jobs pass through the same sequence The 
production scheduling method proposed in this study is heuristic method, NEH and CDS as the initial solution. 
Then, both heuristic method will be conducted as a comparison to find the smallest makespan with Tabu Search 
as the metaheuristic algorithm. Furthermore, a scheduling program is created to improve the performance of

5.  Program validation 
In program validation, the production data in September 2018 was inputted into the program to test whether the 
program was in accordance with the predetermined algorithm. The job sequences, makespan, and mean flow time 
results of program’s calculations were compared with the results of manual calculation. According to the 
comparison result, a similar sequence of jobs, makespan, and mean flow time were obtained. The comparison 
results of makespan and mean flow time calculation can be seen in Table 12.

The initial solution of CDS heuristic algorithm produced smaller makespan value compared to FCFS (First Come 
First Serve) method and NEH algorithm.  The best result of the CDS and NEH algorithm sequences were used as 
the advanced method initialization stage, Tabu Search (TS). The approach of metaheuristic method was needed 
to find a near optimal solution with local search. According to the initial methods (NEH and CDS), CDS produced 
less makespan of 14861,61 minutes than NEH algorithm. But, based on the two extention calculations of the CDS-
TS and NEH-TS methods, both of them produced the same minimum makespan of 14861.61 minutes with 
different job sequences and mean flow time. In scheduling the CDS-TS algorithm, the best job sequence is P10 - 
P4 - P13 - P5 - P14 - P2 - P6 - P7 - P8 - P3 - P11 - P12 - P9 - P1 with mean flow time of 7561.32 minutes. In 
scheduling the NEH-TS algorithm, the best job sequence is P10 - P12 - P13 - P8 - P7 - P4 - P5 - P2 - P1 - P11 - 
P9 - P3 - P14 - P6 with mean flow time of 7458.47 minutes. Both advanced algorithms can reduce makespan 
values to 1697.93 minutes (efficiency increases by 15%) or 28.3 hours from current company scheduling. The 
proposed job sequence for companies is in accordance with the NEH-TS algorithm (P10 - P12 - P13 - P8 - P7 - 
P4 - P5 - P2 - P1 - P11 - P9 - P3 - P14 - P6) because the NEH-TS algorithm produces the smallest mean flow 
time. The scheduling application is Java based, so it can be shared and used in any kind of OS and it is useful to 
simplify and quicken the scheduling calculation.

Abstract 
Models are abstractions of reality expressed in mathematical terms. Abstraction simplifies the underlying 
process and phenomenon being investigated. Model risk arises when the abstraction process is 
inappropriate as a result of data used or model selected. Model risk poses a problem for any organisation 
that relies on models to perform tasks and making decisions. The presence of model risk has resulted in 
the development of model validation techniques to detect inappropriate models. Model validation 
techniques, such as k -fold cross-validation, has been widely adopted for statistical models and machine 
learning models. With the advances of newer models such as AI, deep learning and esoteric machine 
learning techniques, there is a need to develop the appropriate model validation techniques to manage this 
risk. In this paper, we discuss the philosophical issues for model validation and model limitations. 
Through this discussion, we hope to provide possible solutions to tackle model risk as well as general 
principles to tackle model risk in the situation where there are no precedents.

Introduction 
Mathematical Models are found in many organisations across industries such as logistics, banking and even 
government. These models are built as an aid to the organisation to enable them to measure, predict and guide their 
expectations and next course of action. Depending on the industry, some organisations may adapt mathematical 
models in different parts of the business. With the advances in Computer science, Analytics and Data science, 
coupled with technological innovations and improvements, more organisations are deploying mathematical models 
to gain competitive advantages. 
However, this widespread application of mathematical modeling without careful management and consideration can 
be a risky proposition. Organisations in pharmaceuticals, material manufacturing and financial institutions are the 
first few organisations to adopt mathematical modeling and they have experienced the dangers of applying 
mathematical models. Clinical trials failure, material fatigue failures and credit risk crises are just some of the many 
dangers that arises as a result of model misspecification. This model misspecification is also otherwise known as 
model risk.

the uncertainty of the system that generates the data. The second uncertainty refers to the uncertainty of data being 
driven by external factors. Both cases of uncertainty present the problem of veracity and validity and requires proper 
measures to evaluate their impact.  
The first uncertainty is easier to solve as it involves the way the system captures information. To measure the 
uncertainty, pre-programmed scenarios are inserted into the system with known results. The output of the system 
will then be tested for its accuracy. By testing the various inputs from various systems, we can develop a metric that 
measures the deviation from expectation for all the inputs to the model that acts as a proxy to the uncertainty of the 
input data.  
The second uncertainty remains elusive to measure. The inputs to the internal system are derived from systems 
external to the organisation. Some of these systems are not controllable and represent market forces. Thus, 
measuring the uncertainty requires use of proxy and measuring the variability of the data that is coming into the 
system. One possible way is to measure the inherent level of data variability in the inputs from the external system 
which is compared to other time periods. The comparison enables us to see how much data shift happens in the 
system and whether the level of variability in the data changes. By measuring these changes, this provides a measure 
of impact of external environment on the data coming into the internal system. 
 
Solution to limitation 5. Model development history should be recorded automatically.  
 
Recording the model development history in an automated manner is a very simple task with the current level of 
collaborative technology. By using the appropriate modeling system, the model development history can be captured 
easily and reviewed when needed.  
 
Solution to limitation 6. Comprehensive model validity measurements under epistemic uncertainty.  
 
The most difficult aspect of model validation is to identify the model risk under epistemic uncertainty where the user 
has no idea about the structure of the model and the relationships between the inputs. In recent research papers 
(Deng, Yu and Deng, 2018), there have been moves towards the use of Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence to 
develop quantitative measurement of model uncertainty.  
 
Solution to limitation 7. Appropriate probabilistic interpretation rather than simple classifications results 
 
The solution is difficult in some scenario as not all models are developed with probabilities in mind. To solve this, 
modelers has to actually compute the probabilities of their forecasts and predictions. This can also be solved through 
the use of software that compute the values automatically. 
 
Conclusion and Future Direction 
 
Through the discussion about the history of model risk management, we have reviewed all the events leading up to 
modern day model risk management practices and challenges. We have discussed in depth of the general limitation 
of mathematical models and how they impact the accuracy and validity of the models used in risk management. 
With the relevant solution and measurements reviewed, we hope that risk managers can benefit from this discussion

Abstract 
The pressure to the construction companies to promote sustainable development is increasing given 
that construction is a huge consumer of resources. This research is intended to evaluate the application of 
lean principles in the Philippine construction industry towards achieving sustainable construction. 
Specifically, the study sought to find out the level of agreement of the respondents on sustainable 
construction practices and lean principles when grouped according to profiles. The study used descriptive 
method of research and a survey questionnaire have been administered as the research instrument. Statistical 
treatment is applied to analyze the data gathered  
The findings revealed that the respondents agree on sustainable construction practices as well as on 
lean principles in their respective companies. But the difference on the level of agreement when grouped 
according to profiles is not significant on some strategies. 
Hence, even respondents agreed on the sustainable construction practices as well as lean principles, 
it cannot be established that there is a structured application of  lean principles in the construction project 
management of the local construction companies, henceforth, contributing to the achievement of 
sustainable construction practices. 
Further studies on the field be carried out as a collective efforts to justify the finding of this research.

Abstract 
Indonesia is a maritime country has the most islands in the world with many islands 
in Indonesia, where between one island to the other islands are separated by the sea. 
Indonesia has a long coastline that is 95.181 km, of which about three-quarters (5,8 
million   km2)   of   marine   waters   of   Indonesia   is composed of sea coast, seas, 
bays and straits. North Jakarta coastal areas are being reclaimed and is seen 
disturbing the balance three aspects of coastal areas, such as environmental, social, 
and economic, as well as coastal zone management strategy is needed. Analysis of 
North Jakarta coastal zone management with system dynamics models to show the 
relevance of social  aspects (Level  Fishermen welfare), economic aspects   (Revenue 
fishermen)   and   environmental aspects (Area of ponds, mangrove forests, and total 
of fishing). Models are designed to validate with the values obtained, AME (pond 
area) = 49,54%, Average Mean Errors (AME) of validation for (Mangrove) = 5,60%, 
and AME (total of fishing) =5,64%. Simulation models has done up in 2019. The 
impact on the economic aspect is the decrease of fishermen's    income    from    Rp.    
5.000.000,00-Rp.10.000.000,00    to    around    Rp    2.000.000,00-Rp. 3.000.000,00. 
The impact on the social aspect is the reduced level of welfare. The impact on the 
environmental  aspect  is  the  reduction  in  mangrove area, and accompanied by 
increased area of the pond. The design of two scenarios on the model of intervention 
to resolve the existing problems, the first intervention scenario by using of 
technology and the second intervention scenario is a combination of using 
technology and restoration of mangrove forests program. Obtained in the simulation 
results, that both scenarios can show the desired trend in the future.

The vast pond will tend to increase and then constant due to the use of technology to make the 
fishermen do not need to open up new land for the pond. Pond area reduction is intended for forest 
restoration program mangrove (reforestation of mangrove). 
 
5.   Conclusion 
Researchers produced conclusions and suggestions for the  management of coastal areas of North 
Jakarta. Based on the analysis and discussion presented in the previous chapter, we can conclude 
some of the following: 
1. Impact reclamation on coast kelurahan Kamal estuary consist from three aspects, namely social, 
economic, and environmental. Impact on aspect economy is decreasing income fisherman from   
Rp. 5,000,000.00-Rp. 10,000,000.00 to around Rp. 2,000,000.00-Rp. 3,000,000.00. Impact on 
aspect social is decreasing level welfare community. Impact on aspect environment life is 
lessening as well as the mangrove area accompanied with m eningkatnya extents pond. too 
increase mangrove area. The intervention among others: increase number opening fishpond up 
33.10%/ year, increasing number conservation fishpond as big as 30%/year, increasing number 
mangrove growth to 4.2%/year. Impact from increase   number   opening   fishpond   is   
increasing number reduction of mangrove 4%/year. 
2. Strategy management The best coastal by modeling consist from two scenario namely: 
a. On Scenario 1  things to do is use technology for increase productivity fishpond so that 
mangrove area will increase on years next. The intervention among others: increase number 
opening fish pond   up   33.10%/year,   increasing   number conservation fishpond as big 
as 1.5% / year, increasing number mangrove growth to 4.2% / year. Impact from increase   
number   opening   fishpond   is   increasing number mangrove reduction of 6%/year. 
b. On Scenario 2 things to do is merge use technology for increase productivity fishpond with 
increase mangrove restoration program. With scenario this  be  expected  productivity  
fishpond  increase  to reach point maximum and too increase mangrove area. The 
intervention among others: increase number opening fishpond up 33.10%/year, increasing 
number conservation fishpond as big as 30%/year, increasing number mangrove growth to 
4.2%/year. Impact from increase   number   opening   fishpond   is   increasing number 
reduction of mangrove 4%/year.

Abstract 
Proper risk measurement can be useful in determining investment decision choices in the financial asset market. 
There are several models for measuring risk, including Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Modified Value-at-Risk (MVaR). 
Which of the two risk measures are more appropriately applied to analyze multiple stock prices, depending on the 
behavior pattern of each return of the financial assets analyzed. This paper aims to choose a more appropriate risk 
measurement model, if the return of financial assets has a certain behavior pattern. It is assumed that the return of 
financial assets follows the asset-liability model. Similarly, it is assumed that the return data on financial assets 
follows the time series pattern. In this paper, we formulate VaR and MVaR risk measurement models under liability 
assets. Furthermore, an analysis of the comparison between VaR and MVaR is carried out under the asset-liability 
model, using a time series approach. The evaluation of the performance of a risk measure has been done using the 
Lopez II approach. The results of the analysis show that some stocks are more suitable to be measured by VaR, and 
others are more suitable to be measured based on MVaR. So, to choose a more appropriate risk measure, it depends 
on the behavior pattern of stock returns.

1. Introduction
Several types of risks in financial markets, including credit risk, operational risk, and market risk, are the three main 
categories of financial risk. Value-at-Risk (VaR) is mainly related to market risk, but this concept can also be 
applied to other types of risks (Khindanova and Rachev 2005, Holto 2002). VaR can be defined as the maximum 
loss of financial position, along the time period and certain probabilities given (Dowd 2002, Froot et al. 2007). VaR

Abstract 
An insurance insurer has a risk of loss. The risk of loss occurs if the insurer must bear claims beyond his ability. 
However, the insurer can reduce this risk by utilizing reinsurance. This paper intends to examine a reinsurance loss 
model developed by Panjer and Willmot in 1992, to process a group of data so as to produce information needed by 
actuaries in making decisions. Here is described the steps that must be implemented, and the calculation process is 
assisted by a computer application program to make it easier. This model is used to meet the need for information on 
the distribution of total claims, premium stop loss and variance for various retention levels. The calculation results 
show this model is the most effective for the number of policies and small benefits. Because the greater the number 
of policies and benefits, the more number of arrays and elements needed in each iteration and computer application 
program. So that it can quickly produce information needed by actuaries to support decision making. 
Keywords 
Risk of loss, reinsurance, premium stop loss, variance, retention level. 
1. Introduction
Risk is the substance of insurance. In fact, an insurer has a risk of loss. This risk of loss occurs if the insurer has to 
bear a claim that exceeds that ability. The risk of an insurance guarantor can be reduced using reinsurance, where 
another insurance guarantor (reinsurer) acts as a guarantor of insurance from an insurance company (the giver 
company) whose origin is at risk, this is called reinsurance (De Pril, 1986; Pacáková and Zapletal, 2013; Goffard 
and Laub, 2017).

 4. Conclusion 
 
This Panjer and Wilmot (1992) model can be used as an option for actuaries to support important decisions in 
reinsurance. Information generated from this model meets the needs of total claim distribution, stop loss premium 
and variance for various levels of retention. The large number of arithmetic operations and array elements needed in 
each iteration makes this model more efficient and effective for the number of small policies. This is because 
arithmetic operations and the number of elements that must be stored in the array will increase as the number of 
policies increases and the number of benefits we need. The greater the number of policies and benefits of the bj 
involved make the calculation process easier if supported by an adequate computer program and device application. 
This is related to the CPU time needed in the calculation process.

Abstract 
Chaotic systems deal with nonlinear dynamical systems which are highly sensitive to changes in the 
initial conditions. This paper reports the finding of a new 3-D chaotic system with 3 nonlinearities. The 
phase plots and dynamic analysis of the new chaotic system are described by means of MATLAB plots, 
Lyapunov exponents, etc. The chaotic system has a unique saddle-point equilibrium at the origin. As a 
control application, the adaptive synchronization of the new chaotic system with itself is obtained using 
Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, an electronic circuit of the new chaotic system with MultiSIM is 
designed and a good match between the plots of the theoretical chaotic model and the circuit model is 
obtained. The electronic circuit model validates the new theoretical chaotic model developed in this work.

Abstract 
 
electromagnetic problem. The FDTD is derived by discretizing the Maxwell’s Equation using the 
finite difference (FN) method. We test the governing equation by numerically constructing the Yee 
Algorithm in 1-Dimensional (1-D) System to describe the distribution of the Transverse Electric 
(TE) and Transverse Magnetic (TM) within two type boundary condition. First, we simulate the 
system using Perfectly Electrically/Magnetically Conducting (PEC/PMC) boundary condition, 
second with Absorbing Boundary Condition (ABCs). We assume that TE and TM are propagate in 
homogenous and isotropic media. Thereore, the conductivity σ, permeability, μ and permittivity 
remains constant time by time. For a further studiy, we apply the simulation to the isotropic and 
homogenous 2 dimensional earth layers that have a various condition of the BVP. The result leads 
to the conclusion that for the ideal condition of the layered earth model, the simulation is able to 
give a best solution for each earth layer problem.

Problem 
 
The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is an application of the finite difference method, 
commonly used on solving differential equations to solve Maxwell’s equations. The time-dependent Maxwell's 
equations (in partial differential form) are discretized using central-difference approximations to the space and time 
partial derivatives. (rathiv et al, 2012) 
The resulting finite difference equations are solved in FDTD, space is divided into small portions called cells. 
On the surfaces of each cell, there are assigned points. Each point in the cell is required to satisfy Maxwell’s equations. 
(Chan, A, 2006). In this way, electromagnetic waves are simulated to propagate in a numerical space.. FDTD is one of 
the commonly used methods to analyse electromagnetic phenomena at radio and microwave frequencies. The FDTD

2160","From the figure above, we can see that after the wave is collide with the boundary, there are no reflected wave 
both for TE and TM mode. It is called as ABCs boundary condition which can absorb the magnitude of both TE and 
TM. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The FDTD method is widely used because it is simple to solve numerically. It can  solve Maxwell’s time-
dependent curl equations by using finite differences to discretize them. This report describes the design of 1- FDTD 
simulation for both TE and TM mode. This report also successfully demonstrates a working 1D-FDTD code that 
correctly implements PEC, PMC, and ABCs boundaries.

an action of moving peoples from the danger zone or the area that affected by it to a safety zone with the intention of 
safety. When we’re facing the wildfires situation in a building, the evacuation procedure focused on the best attempt 
to finding the shortest route in order to minimize time travel to get out from the building to the safety zone as 
quickly as possible. Evacuation planning in high rise building is totally different compared to evacuation planning in 
open ground. Main components such as rooms, lobbies, corridors, stairs, alleys, etc. can determine the evacuation 
planning to completely success or fail.  
This research will discuss about the application of Floyd-Warshall 
Algorithm in finding the solution of shortest path problem in wildfires evacuation system at eL Royale Hotel 
Bandung as object of this research. 
Keywords : Wildfires, Evacuation, Shortest Path Problem, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.

Introduction
Wildfire is an incident where unwanted fire occurs or fire that placed in a wrong area. It happens because of three 
reasons; by fuel, by oxygen, and by heat sources. Wildfire can happen in anywhere and anytime. For example, it can 
happen on hotel. Hotel is one example of high rise buildings that has a chance where wildfire can be happen. Quoted 
from Decree of Indonesian Minister of Public Works number 11/KPTS/2000, hotel is classified as building that has 
a chance of wildfire in section seven. Thus, hotel building does not have higher risk of wildfires. However, it doesn’t 
mean that wildfire won’t happen in the hotel building. So, the existence of fire protection equipment such as 
sprinkler, hydrant, smoke alarm, and fire extinguisher cannot be ruled out in every hotel.  
Evacuation is an action of moving people from the affected area to the save zone which is far from the affected area. 
The purpose of it is to making sure that those people are saved. When wildfire happens in high rise building, the 
evacuation procedures are focused on searching the shortest route in order to minimize time travel from the danger 
area to the safer zone. Planning the evacuation in high rise building is different from planning evacuation from open 
ground. There are several aspects that we should pay attention to it. Those aspects are rooms, lobbies, stairs, 
corridors, and many more.

Abstract 
National development is a process of changing from a particular national situation to a better national 
condition. Progress in regional development and people's welfare in Indonesia is not always the same 
and evenly distributed, this has resulted in disparities between regions. This condition is caused by 
differences in geographical conditions, natural resources, infrastructure, social culture, and human 
resource capacity. Based on this, a regional development program is needed that is focused on 
accelerating development in areas where social, cultural, economic, regional finance, accessibility, 
and infrastructure availability are lagging behind other regions. This study aims to determine the 
effect of a number of observation variables on the determination of underdeveloped regions and 
regions not lagging behind in Indonesia. The usefulness of this research is to provide 
recommendations to relevant agencies in making policies. This study uses secondary data collected by 
the Central Statistics Agency and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia. The method 
used is Binary Logistic Regression. Based on the results of the analysis it can be concluded that the 
variables of the percentage of poor people, per capita consumption, life expectancy, average length of 
school, percentage of household users of electricity, average distance from the village office to the 
supervising district office, the percentage of villages with critical land influence to the classification 
of underdeveloped areas and not left behind.

1. Introduction
National development is a process of changing from a particular national situation to a better national condition 
(SKBI, 2015). The progress of regional development and people's welfare in Indonesia is not always the same 
and evenly distributed, this results in a gap between regions. The condition is caused by differences in

Odds Ratio value: the percentage of villages with critical land is 1,034, this shows that each increase in the 
percentage of villages with critical land is one percent, then the chance of an area including underdeveloped 
areas increases by 1,034 times compared to regions that are not left behind. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Based on the results of the analysis using the steps outlined, it can be concluded that: 
1. Variables that significantly influence the classification of underdeveloped or not underdeveloped regions, 
namely the percentage variable of the poor (X1), the consumption variable per capita (X2), these two 
variables are included in the criteria of the community economy; life expectancy variable (X3), average 
length of school variable (X4), both of these variables include criteria for human resources; variable 
percentage of electricity user households (X10), these variables include infrastructure criteria; variable 
average distance from the village office to the supervising district office (X18), these variables include 
accessibility criteria; the percentage variable of the village has a critical land (X26), this variable includes 
the characteristics of the region, with the Binary Logistic Regression Model:

of basic education, namely Elementary School/equivalent and Junior High School/equivalent, secondary education 
namely High School/equivalent and higher education namely Higher Education or equivalent Package A equivalent 
to elementary school, package B is equivalent to junior high school and package C is equivalent to high school) 
which is under the supervision of the Ministry of National Education (Kemdiknas), School (APS) is the proportion 
of school children at certain levels of education in the age group (https: //www.bps.go.id).  
Formal education is a structured and tiered educational path consisting of basic education, secondary education, and 
higher education (Depdiknas, 2003), covering elementary/MI/equivalent, junior/MTs/equivalent, high/MA/ 
equivalent and college (Machfoedz and Suryani, 2011). Non-formal education is a pathway to education outside 
formal education that can be carried out in a structured and tiered manner (Depdiknas, 2003). Includes life skills

3.4 Variable Diversity     
 
Variable diversities are described through long / short vector sizes. The variable that has the greatest diversity is the 
school enrollment rate aged 19-24 years, while the variable that has the smallest diversity is the school enrollment 
rate aged 7-12 years. 
 
 
 4. Conclusion 
 
Based on the analysis using Biplot Principal Component Analysis, it was concluded that formed two groups of 
districts / cities with similar characteristics of variables, the percentage of diversity of data that can be explained by 
PCA Biplot was 83,020%, school enrollment rates aged 13-15 years, age 16- 18 years, and the age of 19-24 years 
has a very close relationship, this is indicated by the angle formed by the two lines which shows the school 
enrollment rate, the variable that has the greatest diversity is the school enrollment rate of 19-24 years, while the 
variable that has the smallest diversity is the school enrollment rate aged 7-12 years.

Abstract 
Years 2007-2008 was recorded as the world rice crisis (FAO, 2008). This was marked by the price of rice 
on the world market which experienced a drastic increase of 2,852 times in the range of October 2007 to 
May 2008 (FAO, 2010). Not a few countries in Asia and Africa were affected by the 2008 rice crisis, 
including Indonesia. The purpose of this research is to obtain a population consisting of countries that 
have similarities with Indonesia based on 3 characteristics, namely the atmosphere of democracy, rice 
consumption and restlessness. Using a multidimensional scaling method, a number of countries have 
similarities with Indonesia based on these 3 variables. The context of this study is the study of national 
level crisis indicators. Therefore the results of the research are input in the process of testing the strength 
of an indicator in detecting the existence of a rice crisis. 
Keywords:

1. Introduction
In 2007-2008 was recorded as the world rice crisis (FAO, 2008). This was marked by the price of rice in the world 
market which experienced a dramatic increase which reached 2,852 times in the range of October 2007 until May 
2008 (FAO, 2010). Countries not a few in Asia and Africa were affected by the 2008 rice crisis, including some of 
Indonesia's neighboring countries, for example the Philippines, Bangladesh and others. The Indonesian government 
should be responsive to the situation that befell neighboring countries, because the rice crisis that hit these countries 
could also hit Indonesia. This is because the majority of the Indonesian population consumes rice as one of the 
staple foods. The Indonesian government needs a predictor to see the potential for a rice crisis in Indonesia in the 
future. Yuyun Hidayat conducted research on the strength and predictive ability of the indicators. Unprecentented 
Restlessness (UR) to detect a rice crisis. The purpose of this study is to obtain a population of countries that have

Abstract 
The main problem in regional development lies in the resources and potential they have in order to create an 
increase in the number and type of employment opportunities for regional communities. West Java is a potential 
province, the center of the development of science, technology and education. Through this potential, the 
achievement of development in West Java is still sub-optimal; this is shown by the West Java Human Development 
Index (HDI) which is still below the national average. Symptoms of low levels of education and health characterize 
that investment in human resources in West Java has not been done adequately. When high economic growth is not 
accompanied by a proportional increase in welfare, this indicates that economic growth, processes and benefits have 
not spread relatively evenly due to social problems. Based on the foregoing, a regional development program is 
needed that is focused on accelerating development in areas where social, cultural, economic, regional finance, 
accessibility, and infrastructure availability conditions are still lagging behind other regions. The purpose of this 
study is to classify districts and cities in West Java based on a number of criteria in order to provide 
recommendations to the West Java government regarding policy policies that need to be carried out. The usefulness 
of this research is to provide scientific references for the West Java government in making policies. The data used 
are secondary data collected by the Central Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of 
Indonesia. Using the main biplot’s component analysis, a map of regencies and cities is grouped based on a number 
of criteria as a basis for decision making. 
Keywords: 
Principal component, biplot’s analysis, grouping map. 
1. Introduction
The progress of regional development and people's welfare in Indonesia is not always the same and evenly 
distributed, these results make a gap between regions. The condition is caused by differences in geographical 
conditions, natural resources, infrastructure, socio-cultural, and capacities of human resources (Naibaho, 2016). The 
main problem in regional development lies in the resources and potential they have in order to create an increase in 
the number and types of employment opportunities for the local community. West Java is a potential province, the 
center of science, technology and education development. Through this potential, the achievement of development 
in West Java is still sub-optimal; this is indicated by the West Java Human Development Index (HDI) which is still 
below the national average. Symptoms of low education and health levels characterize that investment in human

Abstract 
      A potential maximal clique of a graph is a vertex set that induces a maximal clique in some minimal 
triangulation of that graph. It is known that if these objects can be listed in polynomial time for a class of graphs, 
the treewidth and the minimum fill-in are polynomially tractable for these graphs. We show here that the 
potential maximal cliques of a graph can be generated in polynomial time in the number of minimal separators 
of the graph. Thus, the treewidth and the minimum fill-in are polynomially tractable for all classes of graphs 
with a polynomial number of minimal separators.  
Keywords 
Graph algorithms, Treewidth, Minimal separators, Potential maximal cliques. 
1. Introduction
The notion of treewidth was introduced at the beginning of the 1980s by (Robertson and Seymour 1984),
(Robertson and Seymour 1986), in the framework of their graph minor theory. A graph H is a minor of a graph 
G if we can obtain H from G by repeatedly usingthe following operations: vertex deletion, edge deletion and 
edge contraction. Among the deep results obtained by Robertson and Seymour, we can cite the fact that every 
class of graphs closed under takingminors which does not contain all the planar graphs has bounded treewidth. 
       A graph is chordal or triangulated if every cycle of length greater or equal to four has a chord, i.e. an edge 
between two non-consecutive vertices of the cycle. A triangulation of a graph is a chordal embedding, that is a 
supergraph, on the same vertex set, which is triangulated. The treewidth problem consists in finding a 
triangulation such that the maximum size of a clique is as small as possible. Another close problem is the 
minimum fill-in problem. Here we have to find a triangulation of the graph such that the number of added edges 
is minimum. In both cases, we can restrict to minimal triangulations, i.e. triangulations with a set of edges 
minimal by inclusion. 
      The treewidth and the minimum fill-in play an important role in various areas of computer science. 
Amongthe real-life applications we can cite sparse matrix factorization (Rose1970), Cholesky factorization (Liu 
1996), perfect phylogeny problem (Kannan and Warnow 1990) and register allocation (Thorup 
1998),(Bodlaender et al. 1998). General techniques exist for solving classical algorithmic graph theory problems 
for graphs of bounded treewidth (Arnborg and Proskurowski 1989), (Courcelle and Mosbah 1993), (Arnborg et 
al. 1993), (Bodlaender and de Fluiter 1996). For an extensive survey of these applications see also (Bodlaender 
1993),( Bodlaender 1997). 
      For computing the treewidth we usually look for a tree decomposition, that is a tree such that each node of 
the tree is labeled by a vertex set of the graph. The labels of the nodes must respect some constraints: every 
vertex of the graph must appear in some label, the endpoints of an edge must appear in a same label, if a same

    Remember that the ith call of the function ONE_MORE_VERTEX costs at most O(nmห𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖+1ห2 + 
n2mห𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖+1ห(ห𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖+1ห− ห𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖ห) time. Usingthe fact that for all i we havethat ห𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖ห≤|𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺|, it follows that the n calls 
of the function ONE_MORE_VERTEX will take O(n2m|_G|2) steps. 
      We conclude that the global complexity of the algorithm is O(n2m|𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺|2). 
      We deduce directly from Theorem 7, Proposition 22 and Theorem 23: 
 
Theorem 24. The treewidth and the minimum fill-in of a graph can be computed in polynomial time in the size 
of the graph and the number of its minimal separators. The complexity of the algorithm is O(n3|𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺|3 + 
n2m|𝛥𝛥𝐺𝐺|2). 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
      The notion of a potential maximal clique seems to be very useful for the study of the treewidth and the 
minimum fill-in problems. We proved in (Bouchitté and Todinca 1999) that the potential maximal cliques are 
suNcient for computingthe treewidth and the minimum fill-in of a graph. In this paper, we enumerate the 
potential maximal cliques in polynomial time in the number of minimum separators of the input graph. In 
particular, this gives a polynomial algorithm computing the treewidth and the minimum fill-in for all the classes 
of graphs with polynomial number of minimal separators. 
      Our generic algorithm is, of course, less efficient than algorithms working on particular graph classes. While 
enumerating the potential maximal cliques of the input graph, we also generate sets of vertices that do not form 
potential maximal cliques, so we loose time. There might also be a faster algorithm to recognize whether a given 
a set of vertices K of a graph G is a potential maximal clique of G than the one of Corollary 12. We feel that 
improvingthese two points might lead to a much better time complexity for the treewidth and minimum fill-in 
algorithm. 
      A class of graphs may have an exponential number of minimal separators and consequently an exponential 
number of potential maximal cliques. Notice that there is no such class of graphs for which the treewidth 
problem has been solved in polynomial time, except the graphs of bounded treewidth. For example, the problem 
is still open for planar graphs. We think that a polynomial number of well-chosen potential maximal cliques 
could permit to compute or at least approximate the treewidth for classes of graphs with “many” minimal 
separators.

Abstract 
     The max-cut problem is one ofthe well known and most studied hard optimization problems. 
In this paper we present an easily computable upper bound on the max-cut based on the maximum eigenvalue of 
an associated matrix. The connection between eigenvalues and cuts in graphs has been first discovered by 
Fiedler. The eigenvalue based methods have proved to be useful also for some other problems, e.g. expanding 
properties of graphs, isoperimetric numbers of graphs, etc. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
The max-cut problem is one ofthe well known and most studied hard optimization
problems. It can be stated as follows. Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) with edge 
weights cij∈R for all ij∈E, find a cut 𝛿𝛿(S) in G for which c(𝛿𝛿(S)) := ∑
𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖∈𝛿𝛿(𝑆𝑆)
 is maximum. 
Here 𝛿𝛿(S) denotes the set of edges {𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖|𝑖𝑖∈𝑆𝑆, 𝑗𝑗∉𝑆𝑆} for S⊂V. 
      The max-cut problem is known to be polynomially solvable for some classes of graphs: 
for planar graphs (Orlova and Dorfman 1972), (Hadlock 1975)), for graphs not contractible to 
K5 (Barahona 1983), for weakly bipartite graphs (Grotschelânâ and Pulleyblank 1981), for 
graphs without long odd cycles (Grötschel and Nemhauser 1984). (Thelatterclasses only foi 
nonnegative weights.) The max-cut problem is NP-complete even for the cardinality version, 
called the maximum bipartite subgraph problem, where all weights cij = 1 (Karp1972). 
     A practical algorithm for solving large instances of the max-cut problem has been 
developed in (Barahona et al. 1988), where also some applications are presented. Another 
application has been given in (Nešetřil and Poljak 1986). A simple polynomial time heuristic 
that guarantees a probabilistic lower bound appeared in ( Poljak and  Turzik 1986). 
     In this paper we present an easily computable upper bound on the max-cut based on the 
maximum eigenvalue of an associated matrix. The connection between eigenvalues and cuts 
in graphs has been first discovered by Fiedler (Fiedler 1973). The eigenvalue based methods 
have proved to be useful also for some other problems, e.g. expanding properties of graphs 
(Alon 1986), (Alon and Milman 1985), (Tanner 1984), isoperimetric numbers of graphs, etc.

Proof. The edge set E(G) can be decomposed into two (
1
2 r, 
1
2 s)-semiregular subgraphs which 
form the optimum bipartition of L(G). The eixstence ofsuch decomposition of E(G) is well 
known. 
 
Proposition 4.4. Let n ≤𝑚𝑚, n even. Then 𝐿𝐿(𝐾𝐾𝑚𝑚,𝑛𝑛)
തതതതതതതതതത is exact. 
 
Proof. We have 𝜆𝜆∞= n(m -1). The max-cut is obtained by 𝛿𝛿({𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖│𝑖𝑖= 1, . . . ,1/2 𝑛𝑛, 𝑗𝑗=
1, . . . , 𝑚𝑚}). 
 
     Line graphs of complete graphs. We have 𝜆𝜆∞L(Kn) = 2(n - 1). 
 
Proposition 4.5. L(K4r+1) is exact. 
 
Proof. It is well-known that K4r+1 has a 2r-regular factor, which is the maximal cut in the line 
graph. 
 
Let us remark that also the circulants C8,2 and С12,2 are exact.

Abstract
Material is everything and all requirement needed during the project construction to support the project activities so
that the project can produce the goal achievement. Material management includes the planning and control related to
the material viewed from various sectors including procurement, supply, purchase, delivery, acceptance,
warehousing and distribution. One of the problems often faced is the material procurement delay. The material is not
available when it is required and this condition causes the reduction of the workers’ productivities. In addition, the
workers’ productivities reduction also affects the time performance of the project construction. The project manager
needs to control the various activities in the project location. One of the importing factors is the time performance.
This research aims to identify the most dominant factor in the material management affecting the time performance
and to analyze the material management risk effect to the time performance in fly over project construction in Banda
Aceh. The observation done to construction implementation teams (stakeholders) in Fly Over Project in Banda
Aceh, they are the owner, supervision consultants and contractors. The statistical analysis used is validity test,
reliability test, descriptive analysis and multiple linear regression. The most affecting material management risk
factor to the time performance in the fly over project construction is quality control factor. It means that if quality
control factor can be well handled, the time performance of the project construction will improve.

1. Introduction
In the construction project, there are various problem must be faced in the project completion (Pérez et al., 2010;
Rani et al., 2013a; Qazi at al., 2016). One of the problems often faced is the material procurement delay (Marzouk
and El-Rasas, 2014; Brahm and Tarziján, 2015; Aziz and Abdel-Hakam, 2016; Gebrehiwet and Luo, 2017). The
material is not available when it is required and this condition causes the reduction of the workers’ productivities
(Ng et al., 2004; Abdel-Razak et al., 2007; Nasirzadeh and Nojedehi, 2013). The productivity reduction gives the
contribution to cost swelling caused by the extension of workers’ salary. In addition, the workers’ productivities
reduction also affects the time performance of the project construction (Brown et al., 2007; Lei et al., 2017, Rani et
al. 2018). The project delay will be penalized or sanctioned by the owner to the contractor (Sambasivan and Soon,
2007; Doloi et al., 2012; Aziz, 2013; Senouci et al., 2016). The sanction is 1 per mile per day multiplied by the
contract value. It will impact to the financial loss not only for small scale project but also for medium and large scale
projects (Toor and Ogulana, 2008; Söderlund, 2010; Maier and Branzei, 2014; Lu et al., 2015; Patanakul et al.,
2016; Liu et al, 2017).
The project runs well if the project can meet all requirements of the cost, time and quality (Atkinson, 1999; Khang
and Myint, 1999; Gardiner and Stewart, 2000; Abdelsalam and Gad, 2009; Kim et al., 2012; Rani et al., 2013b;
Rani, 2017). These three targets affect each other. The material procurement delay problem will cause the addition

Abstract 
Stochastic rules and their inequality are very useful tools in various economic fields and financial 
problems. The purpose of this paper is to determine the main results obtained from the use of stochastic 
rules on financial optimization. Emphasis is placed on demand problems and the effects of changes in 
portfolio selection problems. Some other examples are not directly related to the optimization problem, 
this is given to show a broad view on the application of stochastic rules in financial matters. Stochastic 
orders and their inequalities have been used in various fields on problems related to opportunities (probability) and 
statistics in general. For example, a queuing system with a single service with Increasing Failure Rate (IRF) service 
time and service discipline that prioritizes job savings. Suppose Ti states the ergodic arrival time of a customer when 
service discipline is used.

1. Introduction
Stochastic orders and their inequalities have been used in various fields on problems related to opportunities 
(probability) and statistics in general. For example, a queuing system with a single service with Increasing Failure 
Rate (IRF) service time and service discipline that prioritizes job savings. Suppose Ti states the ergodic arrival time 
of a customer when service discipline is used. 
In the financial sector, the future price (or rate of return) of financial assets is shown by random variables that are 
uncertain. Therefore, a tool is needed to solve the optimization problem which cannot be an exception for the field, 
where many of them use stochastic rules. Likewise in many portfolio selection issues many use stochastic rules. 
Thus, stochastic rules are very useful tools in the problem of portfolio selection. Investors are considered as a utility 
function for u, that want to invest wealth into one or two assets or even more. In the case of two assets, call A and B, 
take X and Y as random variables that show the results of assets A and B. 
Furthermore, according to the principle of utility expectations, these investors overestimate asset A than B, if and 
only if 
𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢(𝑋𝑋)] ≥𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢(𝑌𝑌)] 
1 
The above inequality shows, that for all investors, the utility functions are included in several function classes, 
which are part of stochastic rules for X and Y. 
The purpose of this paper is to introduce stochastic rules on economic problems, namely more specifically on the 
problem of demand and the problem of the effects of changes in portfolio selection. The next section discusses the

Thus, the net premium to be paid by insurance participants in this case is IDR 678,707.65. 
Keep in mind that two examples of such cases are some of the possible cases that are expected to occur within one 
calendar year of insurance. In both cases researchers suggested the company to apply a net premium of IDR 
947,282.00 to avoid future losses. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Based on the analysis and discussion that has been done then it can be concluded that: The modeling in 
this study begins with the selection of distribution and link functions of each dependent variable. 
Furthermore, the regression process is done by forward selection method. The tests used to test the 
significance of the independent variables are the Likelihood Ratio test and the Wald test. The best model 
selection is done by looking at the value of AIC owned by model in every regression process. The 
independent variables that contribute significantly to the variable magnitude of claims are the cause of the 
loss and the year of the car, while for the number of claims are the region and the car cc. After going

ෞ=
15,2983 −0,6854𝑥𝑥𝑃𝑃1 −0,7116𝑥𝑥𝑃𝑃3 −0,8413𝑥𝑥𝑇𝑇12, while the model for the number of private car insurance 
claims is ln 𝜇𝜇2
ෞ= −0,7893 −0,7055𝑥𝑥𝑊𝑊2 + 0,4724𝑥𝑥𝐶𝐶2 + 0,8823𝑥𝑥𝐶𝐶4 + 0,6456𝑥𝑥𝐶𝐶6 + 0,6619𝑥𝑥𝐶𝐶7. 
Based on the two case studies in this study, the estimated net premium of ABC corporate private car 
insurance is IDR 947.282,00. This price is the highest price among the premiums generated through case 
studies. This price is chosen to anticipate future company losses.

Abstract 
 
     FNE Oilfield is geographically located in the southwest of Sudan, about 700 km from the 
capital, Khartoum; structurally located in the northeast of Fula sub-basin of Muglad basin and in 
the southwest of the Moga Oilfield, and has a long narrow structure from northwest to southeast, 
the biggest length of northwest-southeast is about 10 km, the average width of northeast-south is 
about 1.5 Km. The field oil bearing area is around 12 Sq Km. The overall terrain in FNE Field is 
higher in the southwest and lower in the northeast 
 
FNE Oilfield exploration began in 1989, the first well FNE-1 has been drilled in 2005, and then 
immediately the development and research began. The oilfield development Case was completed 
in May 2008 and concluded to go for thermal enhanced oil recovery, Cyclic Steam Stimulation 
(CSS) has been implemented in since 2010 currently about 80 wells under CSS, some of the 
wells reach the 6 cycle. 
 
During steam injection the steam distribute non-uniform because of reservoir heterogeneity and 
effect of steam gravity segregation, the Productivity of upper zones is better than that is of 
bottom zones and layer with excellent productivity continued to be improved with cycles, while 
other zones tended to be worse, and the production has been affected by steam distribution and 
adsorption per layer.  
 
In this paper the well selection, designing, Implementation of Separate Layer Steam Injection/ 
Production from Comingle layers, steam distribution and adsorption as well as production 
analysis before and after will be studied and analyzed.

services are to be built in a big-bang manner. And leadership in cost leadership medicare business is people 
oriented, and in premium medical service it is task oriented.  
Keywords 
Capacity building, Costing, Accounting and Leadership. 
1. Theoretical Framework
In the manufacturing field, cost leadership requires adding capacity in a big bang manner. Whereas 
implementing a differentiation strategy requires incrementally adding capacity. However, it is different in 
medical services (especially when it has become a commodity in India, and service cannot be stored; it has to be 
produced and consumed simultaneously). The above propositions are given as hypotheses below.  
H1: Hospital Capacity for low-cost medical service has to be added in an incremental manner. 
H2: Hospital Capacity for premium medical service is to be added in a big bang manner. 
In manufacturing set up, cost leaders use standard costing and use exception reporting (in terms of variances that 
raise the alarm); whereas the differentiators use ABC costing. However, in medical services, we have the 
following proposition  
H3: In both low cost and premium segments of medical services, one uses ABC (activity-based costing) costing 
as the flow is zigzag in both the cases.  
In the context of manufacturing:  cost leaders’ leadership style is task-oriented while in the context of 
differentiators, it is people oriented. This aspect is almost culture invariant in the service industry. In the context 
of McD (production line approach to service: Theodore Levitt: where food items are precooked) both on 
customer-side (if he has the power to enforce justice) as well as internal side it will be task oriented. However in 
the Indian context, in medical services it is as given below as:  
H4: Leadership in low-cost medical services (in Indian conditions: where a patient takes a loan when he falls 
ill: his expectations are high but due to very poor bargaining power to be demanding) is people oriented; while 
in the premium segment it is task oriented.

Abstract 
Here we show that in the same hospital two different Management Control Systems (MCS) are operating: in high-
risk areas it is interactive, and in low-risk areas diagnostic MCS is used.  
Keywords 
Medical Services, Low-Cost players, Differentiator and Management Control Systems (MCS) 
1. Theoretical Framework
MCS (management control system) is an important part of systems that ensure that strategy as executed conforms to 
strategy formulated. In low uncertainty environment one just goes by exception reporting or diagnostic control 
system. Here we have mass production (product of a kind is produced in large numbers); and we monitor few key 
variables such as production per day, no of rejects, and variance analysis that throws up alarm (if variances are 
significantly high). In other words, goal clarity is very high.  
In differentiators, the goal clarity is not high, and management engages with knowledge workers and frequently 
determines what is achievable and what is not achievable, and also targets are revised frequently. This is known as 
the interactive control system, and here what is used is a balanced scorecard (and this ensures that your objectives 
are a good match to external and internal consistency).  
Here we give its application to the medical field: high risk (uncertainty is high) cases or disciplines need to be 
monitored interactively, and low-risk areas need to be monitored as per exception reporting. Here is a classic case 
that in entire one hospital or organization two totally different MCS are operating (be it a cost leader or 
differentiation hospital).  
H1: MCS for the high-risk dept. (in terms of mortality and associated litigations) such as Pediatrics, Surgery, 
Cardiology and Obstetrics & Gynecology is interactive with smaller times between two successive interactions or 
review.   
H2: MCS for low-risk dept. (in terms of mortality and associated litigations) such as Psychiatry and Orthopedics 
diagnostic control system is needed.  
H3: In hospitals with either cost leader or differentiated medical service both H1 and H2 will be valid.

Abstract 
Here we show that in both low cost and premium services we need multi-process ERP. 
Keywords  
Medical Services, Low-Cost players, Differentiator and ERP. 
1. Theoretical Framework
Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system automates all the processes of an organization, and thus reduces 
effort put in strategy implementation and then managers can devote more time to strategy formulation. It was 
earlier believed that if DSS (decision support system in earlier days) and ERP (now) is successful if it had an 
impact on the organization’s performance. But now with many cases of ERP being abandoned by organizations 
and reverting to the old legacy system, this view is revised. It has led to the practice of ERP being implemented 
in ‘incremental’ manner. Another associated ethical issue frequently raised is that ERP is developed by software 
professionals who know very little of the business for which ERP is being developed.  
In case of low uncertainty environment (here cost leadership strategy flourishes) single process ERPs are 
recommended; while in case of high uncertainty environment (here firms with differentiation/innovation 
strategy flourishes) multiprocess ERPs are recommended. It is widely known that the multi-process ERPs are 
very expensive.  
ERP implementation is associated with power shift (use of power to force ERP implementation; and the current 
power structure is disturbed due to power getting shifted to IT/S dept); high specialization (due to the discipline 
of IT/S professionals being added); high centralization and high formalization and standardization.  
(A1): In the product sector (typically in the manufacturing sector) single process ERP is needed for firms with 
cost leadership strategy and multi-process ERP is needed for firms with a differentiation strategy.  
H1: In the service sector, a similar trend is required as outlined in (A1) above. 
H2: In medical services sector, both in a low-cost and differentiation strategy hospitals (NOT the small and 
medium-sized hospitals) we need multi-process ERP (as both have zigzag workflow). If due to financial crunch 
single process ERP is used, then command and control can be given to the motivated staff that will make it 
operate as a multi-process ERP.

Abstract 
Here we show that the set of functional agents (ENT, Cardiology, Surgery, etc.) is the same in low cost as well 
as premium medical services. However, if patients are generated in low-cost medical services, then it should go 
for simple ‘integrative agent’.  
Keywords 
Medical Services, Low-Cost players, Differentiator and Functional Agents. 
1. Theoretical Framework
In supply chains, Multi-Agent system is regarded as a panacea to the automation of complex processes; and 
reduction of manpower. The agent is an independent entity that interacts with the environment. Agent(s) 
typically represent expert(s) in their respective field(s). In the context of businesses, Agents are typically 
production function, finance function, marketing function, R&D function, HR function, etc. These are in 
accordance with what Lawrence and Lorsh recommended in their paper as differentiation. And these functions 
have specialists who have their own agenda; for example left to marketing professionals they want high product 
variety, rapid fulfillment of demand (by sending half filled trucks to the customers); and this is opposed by 
production professionals as they are trained in cost minimization, longer production runs to have economies of 
scale etc. There is a need to integrate these functions so that all functions move in a nearly same direction.  
And this entity in a multi-agent system is the ‘integrative’ agent. Thus the multi-agent system is very complex. 
Typically ‘integrative agent’ is very complex. Hence we have the following hypothesis.  
H0: In cost leadership strategy it is easy to implement Multi-Agent System as uncertainty is very low, and in 
differentiation/innovation strategy it is relatively difficult to implement the multi-agent system as uncertainty is 
high (as that makes the job of preparing good quality agent  much difficult).  
(A1): It is known that in MAS (multi-agent system) for firms with cost leadership strategy the integrating agent 
is centralized, and in MAS (multi-agent system) for firms with differentiation strategy the integrating agent is 
decentralized.  
Above is true in general for the manufacturing and service sector. 
Here we propose that in the case of hospitals, each agent represents a discipline as cardiology, pathology, ENT 
etc. (as in business organizations we have marketing, production, finance, and R&D agents) that embodies the 
knowledge base of a given branch/field of medicine.

In medical fields, this issue of ‘integration’ is very severe. For example, if BP is high due to the application of 
saline drip, the patient is advised to drink a lot of water to flush out excess salt from the system. On the contrary, 
a kidney specialist always recommends that people should not drink too much water.  
 
H1: However we argue that in case of hospitals geared to give medical service for both cost leaders and 
differentiation strategy, it will have an integrating agent that is decentralized (as customers with deep pockets 
and not so deep pockets have a similar human body and have the same need for integration). This is so because 
integration happens at doctor (functional agent) level.  
 
If the volume of traffic is not very large, then we may not be able to afford premium services of a complex 
system, and hence in low-cost medical business, services of ‘integrative’ agent may not be sought; and 
‘integrative agent’ may be deployed in premium medical services only.  
 
From a business point of view: producers of ‘integrators’ could have different versions, starting from a basic 
model to a highly comprehensive ‘integrator’ (with of course varying costs). Alternatively, we could consider 
custom made ‘integrator’. It could be considered that we may take a modular approach (for example a module 
may consider the integration of heart and knee joints) and supply several modules; instead of writing a 
monolithic software for ‘integrator’.  
 
In a large country where masses are looking for medical attention, a multi-agent system would be a good 
alternative.  
 
 
2. Conclusion  
 
We have given the hypotheses on types of multi-agent systems in the context of hospitals. We are undertaking 
an empirical investigation to verify the above propositions.

Abstract 
The Vehicle Routing Problem VRP determine a rational allocation of routes to an homogeneous fleet of 
vehicles (with the same capacity) in order to serve a set of customers geographically scattered from a 
central depot. Each customer is characterized by known demand. The VRP was introduced by Dantzig 
and Ramser in 1959 and formulated as a graph by Clark and Wright in 1964. 
Since its introduction, the popularity of Vehicle Routing Problem has been steadily increasing in the 
scientific community. The principal’s axes of research are: The design of the variants translating the real 
problems, their modeling under mathematical problems, the development of the resolution’s algorithms 
and/or the construction of the instances used to compare the effectiveness of the presented solutions.  
Our paper presents the state of art of DVRP as taxonomy where each extension is treated in detail. The 
most recently papers published in scientific journals with a high impact factor are processed and analyzed. 
Each part dealing with a particular extension (variant) is concluded by a comparative and summary 
balance of the papers analyzed. The conclusion justifies the relevance of treatment of the variant of 
Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem as a theme of our research.

Abstract 
Forecasting studies of crude oil price depends heavily on historical data. These data should be stationary, 
consistent, and homogeneous when they are used for frequency analyses or to simulate a model. To 
determine whether the data meet these criteria, the researcher needs a simple but efficient screening 
procedure. Such a procedure is described in this paper. A time series of crude oil price data is volatile if its 
statistical properties are unaffected by choice of time origin. The basic data-screening procedure presented 
in this research is based upon split-record tests for stability of the variance and mean of such a time series. 
Although the stability of these two properties indicates only a weak form of volatility, this is enough to 
identify a non-volatile time series or to select those parts of a time series that are acceptable for use. We 
employed statistical package for social science to simulate the stated screening procedure to find out how 
good the data is for further forecasting procedures. It was found out that, after employing all the techniques, 
the data is found to be rich for forecasting of crude oil price for petroleum industry in Malaysia.

1. Introduction
A time series of crude oil price data may exhibit jumps and trends owing to what call inconsistency and non-
homogeneity. Inconsistency is a change in the amount of systematic error associated with the recording of data. It can 
arise from the use of different instruments and methods of observation. Non-homogeneity is a change in the statistical 
properties of the time series. Its causes can be either natural or man-made. These include alterations to economic 
activities (De Vries et al., 2016). The tests for stability of variance and mean verify not only the volatility of a time 
series but also its consistency and homogeneity. In the basic data-screening procedure, these two tests are reinforced 
by a third one, for the absence of a trend. Because all three tests are performed on individual time series that are not 
compared with similar series, their results indicate the presence (or absence) of absolute consistency and homogeneity 
(Franklin et al., 2017). 
We applied the basic data-screening procedure to time series of crude oil price data that are summated over a 
year; we assume that, if the data are acceptable at this level of aggregation, they will be equally acceptable at lower 
levels that cover, say, a month or a day. Nevertheless, the independence (and acceptability) of a time series depends 
on both the level of aggregation and the separation in time of the data points. Of these two, separation in time is the 
easier to verify. For example, separation in time of the data points, so that successive crude oil price events are not

Abstract 
The purpose of this research is to help MSMEs take the right strategies to improve their business 
performance. And Expert Analysis using Fuzzy Logic Tahani System can measure performance and 
provide convenience in its use. Fuzzy input consists of financial perspective, customer perspective, 
internal business process perspective and learning perspective and grocery store growth. While the next 
non-fuzzy variable is weighting each perspective determined by the domain expert. From the simulation 
results based on the data on respondents number 1 (one) for the final value (Na) of 84.0625 by using 
rounding integers to 84, then when using the rules of membership functions, the calculation is as follows: 
μ_ (Less) [x] = 0; x≥75, so the result is 0, μ_ (Enough) [x] = ((85-x)) / 10; 75 ≤x ≤85, so the result is 
0.1, μ_ (Good) [x] = ((x-75)) / 10; 75 ≤x ≤85, so the result is 0.9. From the results of the above 
calculations, it can be concluded that the performance of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) 
in this respondent is ""GOOD"". And this is in accordance with the results of the liner regression 
calculation which also shows the ""GOOD"" category results

Abstract 
 
This study considers a firm's optimal investment timing problem when investment opportunities arrive in a 
random sequence and are irreversible. I analytically derive the project value and the investment threshold. 
The solutions converge to those of the real option value (ROV) method as the arrival rate of investment 
opportunities is higher, whereas the solutions converge to those of the net present value (NPV) method as 
the arrival rate of investment opportunities is lower. Further, I extend the results to a case with two project 
types, namely good and bad types. I analytically derive the condition under which the firm always forgoes 
bad-type projects. A notable result is that the firm accepts a bad-type project for a low arrival rate and a 
high state variable. The results reveal the effects of illiquidity on the real option valuation and build a bridge 
between the NPV and ROV methods.

Abstract 
This research is about the project of FTTH in Bandung, West Java. One of The FTTH projects that located 
in Padalarang, West Java has been identified that the project was delayed by 7.8% on day 11th. This delay 
happened because there’s some lack of managerial project in implementation, controlling, and monitoring 
project work during the execution.  
The aim of this research is to monitor and control the project by analyzing actual project performance using 
Earn Value Method (EVM) approach. The compression schedule is performed using Crashing Program on 
the activities that are critical, which has been identified before through Critical Path Method (CPM).  
The result of this research is to make the project will be completed in 23 days, the same amount of days 
according to the initial target planning even though on the 11th day the project is delayed. It is found that 
the activity of cable distribution could be accelerated from 4 days to 2 days by adding 4 workers and the 
cost slope is Rp465.224. While on the activity of installation ODP and Splitter could be accelerated from 3 
days into 2 days with cost slope of Rp332.533 and the amount of additional work required is 1 person who 
is an expert technician/jointer.

1. Introduction
A company that works in the field of telecommunications often provides a variety of communication services that 
must be supported by the speed of fast internet access in order to meet the customer needs. Nowadays, fast internet 
access could be done using fiber optic network as the transmission medium. Based on this condition, FTTH project 
was initiated to expand the fiber optic network cable to whole Indonesia. FTTH (Fiber to the Home) is fiber optic 
network is distributed to the customer's home using fiber optic cable as its transmission media (Fitriyani, 2015). 
Distribution of fiber optic cable is intended for users to have fast internet access network and have digital data service 
with big bandwidth capacity and very low interferences.  
One of the FTTH project work was located in Bandung. It was found that the completed progress up to the day 11th 
was 37,31% while the project should have reached 45,11%. This indicated a delay on the schedule in project execution. 
To avoid project delays, continuous monitoring and controlling are required throughout the project execution (Ibrahim 
& Kaka, 2008).  
Based on the obtained data of the this FTTH Project, project monitoring and controlling was performed by analyzing 
actual project performance. This performance analysis could be done by using Earn Value Method (EVM) approach. 
EVM is a control method used to control the cost and time of project work in an integrated manner (Dewi, et. al, 
2015). The EVM method was used to measure the amount value of completed job at a time by comparing it to the 
amount of budget provided for the job (Witjaksana & Reresi, (2012). After the delay has been identified, Crashing 
Program was used to accelerate project duration in order to avoid delay by reducing the duration of the activities that

Normal daily productivity is calculated by dividing the value of the activity weights that have been obtained before 
with the amount of completion time planning. After that, the calculation of daily productivity after crash needed to be 
done to calculate the acceleration duration on the pulling out distribution cable activity.  
Table 2 shows the result of normal daily productivity, daily productivity after crash, completion time, wages/day, 
crash cost/person, crash cost, and cost slope for crashing on pulling out distribution cable activity.

Known from the obtained data that the activity of ODP and splitter installation as many as 13 units will be completed 
for 3 days with the amount of resource needed is a team of 2 people with a service wages to complete of Rp1,995,201. 
So, it can be assumed that every worker has a productivity of 50% of ODP and splitter installation activity.   
Normal daily productivity is calculated by dividing the value of the activity weights that have been obtained before 
with the amount of completion time planning. After that, the calculation of daily productivity after crash needed to be 
done to calculate the acceleration duration on the ODP and splitter installation activity. 
Table 3 shows the result of normal daily productivity, daily productivity after crash, completion time, wages/day, 
crash cost/person, crash cost, and cost slope for crashing on ODP and splitter installation activity.

5. Conclusion 
Acceleration of project schedule that are conducted on this FTTH project is done by using crashing method. Schedule 
compression is performed on monitoring and controlling phase by comparing the progress of actual implementation 
project with progress planning project. From the comparison, it could be identified that the project experienced a delay 
of 7.8% from planning at the day 11th.  
To avoid delay in project completion time, acceleration schedule is performed using crashing method on the remaining 
activities on critical path. Obtained that the pulling out distribution cable activity can be accelerated to 2 days with 
cost slope in the amount of Rp465,225. While the duration of ODP and splitter installation activity can be accelerated 
from 3 days to 2 days with cost slope equal to Rp332,534.

Abstract 
Nowadays leanness implementation was more and more widely applied in production organizations to eliminate 
various kind of waste and reduce overall cost of business firms. During the implementation process, the incorrect 
choices of implementation areas may result in high cost but no obvious improvement, even the appearance of 
employee dissatisfaction. In this study, a leanness assessment method based on principal criteria searching approach 
was established. Principal Component Analysis was used to assess and improve lean performance throughout the 
entire organization, qualitative factors were considered as well as quantitative factors based on fuzzy logic. 
Throughout the identification of key leanness factors of an specific industry, a comprehensive assessment model 
corresponding to the characteristics of that industry was established. Finally a case study of a Chinese special 
purpose vehicle manufacturing organization was presented, the results show that the correlation among 15 different 
leanness factors and 8 principal indicators mainly contributed to the leanness performance, thus the overall 
measurement of leanness performance of several workshops could be achieved.

1. Introduction
Lean production (LP) has long been recognized as one of the most effective for both manufacturing and service 
organizations. It originated from Toyota production system and gradually evolved into a famous management 
philosophy. The keynote of lean production is to eliminate 7 kinds of wastes (non-value added process) in a 
production system: waiting time, correction of defects, over processing, over motion, over handling, over 
production, excess inventory. The underutilization of the employees’ creativity was considered as the eighth waste 
recent days. As more and more organizations applied lean production method to gain powerful competitive 
advantages in the globalized marketplace, the objective assessment of overall lean performance is strongly 
demanded for organizations, especially business firms. Certain approaches for leanness measurement were 
contributed by researchers, and various kinds of leanness assessment tools were developed. In this study, a leanness 
assessment method based on the characteristics of production organizations has been proposed, which overcomes 
the problem that the previous models have not considered the applicability of different type of production 
organizations. The conceptual model was firstly developed including both quantitative and qualitative criteria, then 
the critical criteria were selected out through principal component analysis, which transfer the original model to a 
new model with less criteria included but reflect the characteristics of the production organization. Finally a 
comprehensive assessment model was developed. The uniqueness of this study is that dimensionality reduction 
theory was applied as an attempt to make the assessment criteria more accordingly, thus to overcome the drawbacks 
of previous studies.

It could be concluded from table 7 that the leanness level of the 10 workshops, which also indicated the principal 
part need for improvement. For example, sample 5 scored low on the third principal component, it showed that the 
corresponding workshop was at a low level on production process management, the manager should immediately 
focus on improving the production process in leanness implementation, thus the leanness level of the production 
organization could be most effectively promoted. 
 
The leanness assessment result also showed the key criteria affecting leanness level in Suizhou special purpose 
vehicle manufacturing industry. As the principal component 1 shared the highest contribution rate, the most 
important lean indicators for Suizhou special purpose vehicle manufacturing industry is

production is pulled by the shipment of finished goods. In fact, the main contents of the industry are welding, 
cutting, bending, and other low skilled jobs, which are accomplished mainly manual labour. And since the 
production characteristics could be expressed as: multispecies, small amount and high value of single product, the 
production was mainly driven by orders. It showed that the assessment result is consistent with reality, and the 
rationality of the method is verified. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The establish of a scientific assessment system, making the assessment of lean level no longer depends on subjective 
evaluation. Also, such method help managers find key factors for lean implementation, thus the best improvement 
effect at a certain cost could be achieved. As previous studies mainly focus on measuring the leanness level of 
organization from the perspective of integrity, the general model does not take full account of the differences in 
production industries. In this research, a leanness assessment method based on principal components analysis was 
proposed, the key leanness factors of a production industry are reflected through production related data, thus the 
drawback that the previous models have not considered the applicability of different type of production 
organizations was overcame.

Abstract 
Change is something that cannot be avoided in organizational life as well as changes in research institutions. The 
rapid development of science and technology has become a driving force for research institutions to be able to adapt 
and have the ability to compete with other research institutions or other institutions. These changes make research 
institutions must be able to identify the potential and resources they have to be able to survive and improve. 
Organizational changes in research institutions do not necessarily just happen, but there needs to be readiness to 
change in organizations or researchers as the main drivers of research activities. This study aims to find out how the 
dynamics of readiness to change for researchers when responding to organizational changes in their research 
institutions. The method used uses a qualitative approach by conducting surveys and will be interpreted 
descriptively and in depth interviews. The results found are the level of readiness to change for researchers is high 
enough which means they respond to changes in the organization of research institutions responded positively and 
showed willingness to support and get involved in the success of the organizational change targets.

INTRODUCTION 
Change is a sure thing as time goes by, everything will change. As an illustration, change is an individual who 
grows and develops. As for living things that move dynamically and make many changes, profit organizations and 
non-profits will also experience change. Organizational changes can move forward or stagnate or decline. It depends 
on how the speed and strategy of the organization responds to changes that exist from within or from outside the 
organizational environment itself. 
Research institutions as organizations engaged in the development of science and technology are inseparable from 
their ability to respond to change. The advancement of science and technology in the regional, national and even 
international environments has been the trigger for the changes that continue to roll along with the progress and 
various discoveries in the field of science and technology. These changes trigger changes from every interested 
organization, as well as research institutions both internally and externally. As in two cases, two research institutions 
must undergo and undergo fundamental changes, namely organizational changes from their structure and governance, 
thus impacting the overall change of each organizational line. The response to change that must be done as a form of 
strategy for the research institution is to survive and be able to develop itself in the future, so that it can be in line with 
the development of science and technology as its core business. 
In this case study involving two research institutions with the same background in making organizational changes. 
Research in the field of plantations alone has existed and stood since the Dutch colonial era in line with the time and 
moment of independence of the Republic of Indonesia, it is in the shade of the government, especially from the 
Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture. Alongside the road institutional structures that are difficult to do, it requires 
changes in the status of governance and organizational structure of research institutions. Organizational change is

that have similarities and there are several different aspects based on the approach of the two research institutions 
managing changes. 
The changes made by the two organizations or research institutions do not change the existing organizational 
culture before only making explicit the values that can be understood by all organizations. The changes that have been 
made focus on changes in the management of the organization of research and a clearer focus of research, especially 
the output that must be achieved to support the independence of the organization. Organizational changes are 
incremental continuously which aims to be able to change the mainset of individuals throughout the members so that 
they are more open, competitive, and professional in working in their fields. 
The first change made by the organization is to communicate the plan of change to all its members. It aims to 
improve the readiness of individual members to support the change and readiness of the organization to change. The 
process covers all levels of organizational members and the most important role is the managers as agents of change. 
Communication regarding plan information and implementation of changes is done with the change team educating its 
managers as agents of change that will transmit to all of its subordinates. Plan changes as the change path of the plan 
changes, transition periods, and organizational change processes that take a long time. In the change planning process, 
all management prepares changes from all material aspects of change related to strategy, structure, systems, shared 
values, skills, staff, and leadership styles. Seven areas from 7 McKinsey are important aspects to be designed and 
implemented in organizational change because they cover all components of organizational change. 
Based on the dynamics of changes in the research institute, it was found that the role of style from leaderhip 
plays an important role in organizational changes that are in line with the objectives of the change. An open, 
communicative, assertive, and committed leadership style to support organizational change is the direction and 
motivation for its members to be ready and willing to contribute to organizational change. 
 
CONCLUSION 
Changes to institutions or organizations can be done spontaneously because they need to prepare for it. 
Preparing all organizational components to change is a shared responsibility that promotes organizational members 
with aden aden. 
Two research institutions in this study have been studied quite a lot. The two research groups are responsible for 
the organization's potential for the institution by looking at the resources of each organization. In this study it can be 
concluded that this study is able to produce, build, and use resources by looking at seven organizational elements of 7 
Mckinsey. 
The success of the organization in planning organizational changes by paying attention to and handling various 
important things to be implemented in the implementation. Organizational readiness to change the organization's speed 
measurement for correctional information appropriately. That is because there are organizations that can be accessed 
by organizations with sources of information and sources of information. Besides that there is an organization's ability 
quickly and in accordance with what is needed by the organization. This was done as a previous dimension of 
repeatability. Arrangement needed. And the final dimension is the innovation carried out by the organization itself in 
the organization. Organizational change itself is an ongoing activity and must have goals based on organizational 
needs. 
When two research institutions were able to prioritize the preparation of changes to support the success of the 
change, it was proven to have a positive impact on the success of the organization's change. Before making changes, 
the two research institutions are able to explore organizational resources, potential, know the source of the problem, 
and know the needs of the organization now and in the future. 
Based on this research, it is better for future research to be more able to measure organizational readiness in 
more depth with the broader subject of research. Subsequent research can be carried out at government research 
institutions or profit and non-profit research institutions. It is useful to build empirically about the importance and 
impact and variables of organizational readiness to change. As well as the results of this study can be used as a 
reference for private or government research institutions, both profit and non-profit, when planning and making 
organizational changes.

Abstract 
This research article proposes new metaheuristics method to solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 
This method is called Partial Comparison Optimization (PCO). TSP is defined as a problem where a 
salesman must visit all cities where each city is only visited once, and must start from and return to the 
origin city. The goal of solving this problem is to determine the route with minimum total distance or 
cost. TSP was first formulated in 1930 and it is one of the most intensively studied problems in 
optimization. Variants and various application of TSP have been developed and solved to accomodate 
industrial problems. TSP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It means TSP can be solved 
in polynomial time. Exact methods are hard to solve big size TSP problem. The process of the exact 
method needs longer computational time to solve the problem. The limitation of exact method in dealing 
with complex TSP only can be solved by metaheuristics. PCO is powerful metaheuristic to solve 
combinatorial problems such as TSP. To test the performance of PCO, it was used to solve some TSPLIB 
instances. In this research PCO gave good optimum solution that almost close to the optimal solution of 
every TSPLIB instance.

1. Introduction
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is problem of a salesman to search shortest traveling distance for 
visiting every city and back to the origin city (Yan et al. 2017). Salesman has to search sequence of cities from 
origin city and back to the origin city. For the different permutation of cities sequence, a salesman will obtain 
different traveling distance. It become to the salesman to search shortest traveling. Cities in TSP are located in 
Euclidean plane and the distance between two cities is ordinary Euclidean distance (Wang et al. 2017). In a various 
objection, shortest traveling distance could be defined as minimum traveling cost. 
TSP can be simply defined as a complete weighted graph G = (V, E, d) from the perspective of graph 
theory (Wang, 2017). V = {1, 2, . . . , n} is a set of vertices (cities). E = {(i, j )|(i, j ) ∈ V × V } is a set of edges, and d 
is a function assigning a weight (distance) dij to every edge (i, j) (Wang et al. 2017).  
It is one the most widely and famous studied combinatorial problems (Ozden et al. 2017). It has several 
applications in its purest formulation, such as transportation, logistics, and planning. In the development, TSP is

Table 2 shows that PCO has good solution to solve TSP. The result almost close to the optimal solution of 
every TSPLIB instance. Even one of the solution of PCO has better solution than optimum tour declared by TSPLIB 
instance. PCO optimum tour (1 14 13 12 7 6 15 5 11 9 10 19 20 21 16 3 2 17 4 18 22 8 1) give 75.25 compared with 
TSPLIB instance tour (1 14 13 12 7 6 15 5 11 9 10 19 20 21 16 3 2 17 22 4 18 8 1) that give result 75.64 in 
ulysses22 data. 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
PCO is new metaheuristic proposed to solve combinatorial problem such as TSP. PCO has high capability 
to give optimum solution in order to search shortest distance of TSP. In future research, PCO can be improved in the 
time of calculation.

Abstract 
Last mile logistics is the most time consuming and expensive stage of the delivery process. Facing the 
competitiveness of E-commerce with the rapidly fluctuating consumer demand is one of the biggest 
challenges faced by most of the companies. Further, Last mile delivery performance became the most 
crucial factor of the relationship between E-commerce retailer and end customer, as it can either establish 
or break the bond, which directly affects on the reordering decision of the customer. At present, customers 
have plenty of online buying options to switch up. Therefore, retailers exert pressure on Last mile service 
providers to optimize their performance. The challenge lies in the reaction of last mile services providers 
when meeting the requirements of increased parcel demand. Thus, maintaining cost efficiency and high 
quality of the service are essential for Last mile services providers to succeed in online business. 
Unfortunately, most of the Last mile strategies fail because of not conducting proper studies on the 
expectations of key parties; retailers, last mile service providers and customers. This scrutiny focuses on 
eliminating the inefficiencies in Last mile delivery by identifying the factors that should be considered 
when implementing a Last mile strategy by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of current practices 
through qualitative and quantitative analysis, using key parties engaged in last mile delivery in Sri Lanka. 
Thematic analysis and regression analysis are used as the main methodologies to identify the relationships 
within the variables. The strategic model presented by the current scrutiny as the final output can be used

Abstract 
The objective of this study is to apply ECRS technique to reduce waste in production line of detergent packaging 
process. The flow process chart has been used to analyze the data for improvement using ECRS. Consequently, 
the unnecessary workflows in the process are removed and some similar tasks are combined. Apart from this, the 
rearrangement in working position and re-layout of the production line are also applied. After applying the ECRS 
concept, the results shown that the number of workers in the process was reduced from 12 to 9 persons which 
saved the operating cost about 54,000 THB/month. Due to the reduction of the distance of product flow in machine 
A and B from 31.36 to 24.41 meters and 26.48 to 24.41 meters, respectively, the cycle times of machine A and B 
was decreased from 397 to 319 seconds and 354 to 319 seconds, respectively. Finally, the line balancing was 
increased from 72% to 92%.

Abstract 
The norm space is the pairs of vector space with defined norm in the vector space. An example of vector space is ℓ𝑝𝑝. 
Vector space ℓ𝑝𝑝 is a space that contains all real number sequences that satisfy the sums of all elements in ℓ𝑝𝑝 normed 
space. Furthermore at ℓ𝑝𝑝 can be defined as a norm-2 ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝, that is equal to the sum of all 2 dimensional matrix 
determinant in norms in ℓ𝑝𝑝, such that ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝൯ is a 2-normed space. Result of this study is seeking at the 
completeness of 2-normed space ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝൯by utilizing the completeness of norm space ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝൯.

Because ‖𝑥𝑥, 𝑎𝑎‖𝑝𝑝≤2
1−1
𝑝𝑝‖𝑥𝑥‖𝑝𝑝‖𝑎𝑎‖𝑝𝑝= ‖𝑥𝑥‖0 and ‖𝑥𝑥, 𝑏𝑏‖𝑝𝑝≤2
1−1
𝑝𝑝‖𝑥𝑥‖𝑝𝑝‖𝑏𝑏‖𝑝𝑝= ‖𝑥𝑥‖0, it results  
2‖𝑥𝑥‖𝑝𝑝‖𝑎𝑎, 𝑏𝑏‖𝑝𝑝≤3‖𝑎𝑎‖𝑝𝑝‖𝑥𝑥, 𝑏𝑏‖𝑝𝑝+ 3‖𝑏𝑏‖𝑝𝑝‖𝑥𝑥, 𝑎𝑎‖𝑝𝑝 
≤3൫‖𝑎𝑎‖𝑝𝑝+ ‖𝑏𝑏‖𝑝𝑝൯‖𝑥𝑥‖0 
or 
2‖𝑎𝑎, 𝑏𝑏‖𝑝𝑝
3൫‖𝑎𝑎‖𝑝𝑝+ ‖𝑏𝑏‖𝑝𝑝൯
‖𝑥𝑥‖𝑝𝑝≤‖𝑥𝑥‖0. 
That show that ‖∙‖0 is equivalent to ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝∎ 
 
Corollary 1. (ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙‖0) space is Banach space. 
 
From Definition 6. about Banach space and with explanation above, obtains that (𝓵𝓵𝒑𝒑, ‖∙‖0) space is Banach space. 
After that, form Lemma 1. is obtain 
 
‖𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦‖𝑝𝑝≤2
1−1
𝑝𝑝‖𝑥𝑥‖𝑝𝑝‖𝑦𝑦‖𝑝𝑝 
‖𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛−𝑥𝑥, 𝑦𝑦‖𝑝𝑝≤21−1/𝑝𝑝‖𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛−𝑥𝑥‖𝑝𝑝‖𝑦𝑦‖𝑝𝑝 
Since 𝑦𝑦∈ℓ𝑝𝑝, then ∑|𝑦𝑦𝑘𝑘|𝑝𝑝< ∞
𝑘𝑘
, such that ‖𝑦𝑦‖𝑝𝑝 is finite. As result, if (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is a convergent sequence in ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, |∙|𝑝𝑝൯, 
then 21−1/𝑝𝑝‖𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛−𝑥𝑥‖𝑝𝑝‖𝑦𝑦‖𝑝𝑝→0. From that, the results can be obtained from the following theorem. 
 
Theorem 2. In ℓ𝑝𝑝 space, if a sequence (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is convergent to 𝑥𝑥∈ℓ𝑝𝑝 in ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝 term, then this sequence will 
convergent to 𝑥𝑥 in ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝. Similar to that, if sequence (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is a Cauchy sequence in ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝 term, then this sequence is 
Cauchy sequence in ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝. 
 
Proof. (1) Let {𝑎𝑎, 𝑏𝑏} is independent set in ℓ𝑝𝑝 and ‖∙‖0 is defined. If (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is convergent to 𝑥𝑥 in ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝, then 
‖𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛−𝑥𝑥, 𝑎𝑎‖ →0, for 𝑛𝑛→∞ 
and 
‖𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛−𝑥𝑥, 𝑏𝑏‖ →0, for 𝑛𝑛→∞. 
This resulted 
‖𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛−𝑥𝑥‖0 →0, for 𝑛𝑛→∞ 
its mean (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is convergent to 𝑥𝑥 in ‖∙‖0. From Theorem 1., it has been obtain that (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is convergent to 𝑥𝑥 in ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝. 
(2) Let {𝑎𝑎, 𝑏𝑏} is independent set in ℓ𝑝𝑝 and ‖∙‖0 is defined. If (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is a Cauchy sequence in ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝, then  
‖𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚−𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛, 𝑎𝑎‖ →0, for 𝑚𝑚, 𝑛𝑛→∞ 
And 
‖𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚−𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛, 𝑏𝑏‖ →0, for 𝑚𝑚, 𝑛𝑛→∞. 
This resulted 
‖𝑥𝑥𝑚𝑚−𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛‖0 →0, for 𝑛𝑛→∞ 
its mean (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is Cauchy sequence in ‖∙‖0. From Theorem 1., it has been obtain that (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is Cauchy sequence in 
‖∙‖𝑝𝑝. ∎ 
 
Theorem 2. resulted that ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝൯ is a 2-Banach space. This is explained in the following corollary 
 
Corollary 2. ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝൯ is a 2-Banach space. 
 
Proof. let (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is a Cauchy sequence in ℓ𝑝𝑝 with ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝 term. Then with Theorem 2. has obtained that (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is a 
Cauchy sequence in ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝. Since ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝൯ is a Banach space, then for all Cauchy sequences (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛)  in ℓ𝑝𝑝 is 
convergent to 𝑥𝑥∈ℓ𝑝𝑝 in ‖∙‖𝑝𝑝. From Lemma 2. (𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛) is convergent in ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝, such that ൫ℓ𝑝𝑝, ‖∙,∙‖𝑝𝑝൯ is 2-Banach space.

Abstract 
Generalized Space Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model was used to model the time series data that had correlation 
inter-location (space time). In the stage of model identification, spatial weight on GSTAR model shown relations of 
inter-location, which were weight normalized cross-correlation, binary, uniform, and inverse of distance. Data 
grouping uses the CLARANS (Clustering Large Application based on Randomized Search) Cluster analysis method, 
which is a clustering method that involves spatial elements by determining the number of clusters at the beginning 
where each object has the opportunity to be selected as a cluster center. The data used was secondary data of Farmer 
Exchange Rates in 32 provinces for 71 months from year 2005 to 2013, which has been obtained from the Economic 
Indicators published by BPS every month. Model candidates that have been obtained of the data were GSTAR(1;1) 
and GSTAR(2;1;1).

The value of STACF in Table 2, uses a cross correlation matrix of binary, uniform, and inverse distance decreases 
significantly (tail off) on all spatial lags so it can be concluded that the data obtained is stationary data. STPACF value 
in Table 3 cut off at certain time lags and spatial lags. The following is a list of candidate models from the four weight 
matrices of the location.

follow: 
a. 
The Role of Matrix Weight The location at the identification stage of the model is to see how much correlation 
each neighbor has to a location. The Location Weight Matrix also plays a role in checking stationary and 
identifying candidates for the Generalized Space-Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model. 
b. Model candidates for Farmer Exchange Rate data include GSTAR (1; 1) and GSTAR (2; 1.1).

Abstract 
Graph applications develop quite rapidly in the transportation system. One of the applications is used to search for 
travel routes. The route from a terminal to an intersection that must be passed exactly once and must return to the 
original terminal is a very important issue. Determination of the TMB travel route (Trans Metro Bandung) using the 
Nearest Neighbor method. The results show that the TMB bus journey on corridor 2 (Cibeureum - Cicaheum) can be 
formulated into graph form. The bus transportation system is modeled in graph using the point symbol (Vertex) as a 
shelter and edge symbol as a path that connects between shelters. The TMB bus route in the graph is a closed track 
and is called the Hamilton Cycle. The results of route calculation and search from TMB corridor 2 produce different 
routes and distances from the initial, including: St. Ah. Nasution - St. Ahmad Yani - St. Ibrahim Adjie - St. Jakarta - 
St. Ahmad Yani - St. Asia Afrika - St. Sudirman - St. Rajawali Barat - St. Elang - St. Rajawali Timur - St. Kebon 
Jati - St. Perintis Kemerdekaan - St. Lembong - St. Ahmad Yani - St. Ah. Nasution. From a distance of 28.4 km to 
27.65 km.

Abstract 
Multicollinearity is the condition that there is a correlation between independent variables which is a problem. This 
event often occurs in regression analysis. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method 
regression can reduce multicollinearity and increase the accuracy of linear regression models. The lasso parameter 
estimator can be solved by the LARS (Least Angle Regression and Shrinkage) algorithm which calculates the 
correlation vector, the largest absolute correlation value, equiangular vector, inner product vector, and determines 
the LARS algorithm limiter for LASSO. LASSO method regression with a more detailed procedure and selecting the 
best model using the 𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝 Mallows statistics is discussed in this paper. LASSO method will be applied to Indonesia's 
foreign exchange deposit data. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Correlation in regression analysis is correlation with the aim to predict the value of non-independent variables
based on the independent variables. In fact, a correlation between variables does not only consist of two variables, but 
there can be a correlation between three or more variables called multiple linear regression (Permai and Tanty, 2018)

Model Regresi dari Metode LASSO Regression 
Based on Table 4 and Table 5 can be obtained the model of LASSO method as follows: 
Y෡= −0.077358603X1 −0.14037599X2 + 0.104015412X3 + 0.013263973X4 
The meaning of the model above is if net foreign assets increase by one trillion, the value of Indonesia's 
foreign exchange deposits will decrease by 0.077358603 or 7.7358603%. As with net domestic assets, if there is an 
increase of one trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits will decrease by 0.14037599 or 
1.4037599%. Different from the net bill to the central government, if it experiences an increase of one trillion, the 
value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposit will increase by 0.104015412 or 1.04015412%. While bills to other 
sectors, if there is an increase of one trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits will increase by 
0.013263973 or 1.3263973%. 
 
4. Conclusions  
 
In this paper we have analyzed the LASSO method parameter can be specified with LARS algorithm which 
calculates correlation vector, the largest absolute correlation value, equiangular vector, inner product vector, and 
determines the LARS algorithm limiter for LASSO. The model of LASSO method as follows:  
 
Y෡= −0.077358603X1 −0.14037599X2 + 0.104015412X3 + 0.013263973X4 
 
Base on model if net foreign assets increase by one trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits 
will decrease by 0.077358603 or 7.7358603%. As with net domestic assets, if there is an increase of one trillion, the 
value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits will decrease by 0.14037599 or 1.4037599%. Different from the net 
bill to the central government, if it experiences an increase of one trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange 
deposit will increase by 0.104015412 or 1.04015412%. While bills to other sectors, if there is an increase of one 
trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits will increase by 0.013263973 or 1.3263973%.

Abstract 
Problems by junior high school students in learning mathematics is when solving math problems. Then conducted 
research aimed to find out the types and causes of errors made by students especially when completing mathematical 
questions on the inner circle and outer circle triangle to find alternative solutions and overcome the causes of the 
students' errors. The subjects of this study were students of class VIII5junior high school 5 Siak Hulu and totaling 36 
people. This study uses a qualitative descriptive method. Data analysis techniques are descriptive analysis 
techniques. The data collection method used is the test method. Based on the results of the study, there were still 
many students who made mistakes in solving math problems in the subject of inner circle and outer circle of 
triangles. the types of errors are: misconceptions, principle errors, and operating errors in which the most common 
mistakes are the misconceptions of painting the inner circle and the outer circle of the triangle with the number of 
errors 60 and the percentage of 44.44%. 54 and a percentage of 40%, and a principle error of 21 and a percentage of 
15.55%.

Principle Error 
Students are confused to distinguish which formula is used to 
find the length of the radius of the inner circle and the outer 
circle of the triangle, it is not complete to write the formula and 
also really do not understand the formula. 
 
 
We can discussion alternative problem SolvingWhat can be attempted to overcome the mistakes of students 
in solving problems such as students must be diligent in repeating at home the lessons that have been obtained at 
school, more thoroughly in answering and reading questions, the teacher must familiarize students to solve problems 
with the correct problem solving steps and complete, the teacher should provide material and an easy way for 
students to be studied at home and the teacher asks the material at the next meeting for each student so that students 
are more motivated to learn. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Based on the research that has been conducted on students of class VIII5 of junior high school 4 Siak Hulu, it 
can be concluded that: 
The types of errors that students carry out in solving math problems are the following topics: the inner circle 
and the outer circle of the triangle are as follows: 
a) Errors related to concepts 
 Error specifying the angle bisector 
 Error determining the location of the center point 
b) Errors related to Operations 
 Error in calculating 
 Error entering the known number 
c) Errors related to principles 
 Error using unrelated formulas 
 Error using the formula between the inner circle and the outer circle of the triangle. 
 
The cause of the students' mistakes is that they do not want to solve problems correctly, are less diligent and 
lazy in memorizing formulas. As a result, students just leave the answer before completing it correctly, are less 
careful about the calculation and how to solve the problem that is done due to rush. forget the formula, because 
students do not take lessons and often sleep during the learning process. consider the problem difficult so that it 
doesn't solve it correctly. students forget and do not understand the concept used to paint outer circles and inner 
circles of triangles and consider this material difficult and too much.

Abstract 
The purpose of this research is to help Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) take the right 
strategies to improve their business performance. Expert Analysis use Fuzzy Logic Tahani System which 
measure performance and provide convenience. Fuzzy input consists of financial, customer, internal 
business process and learning perspective, also grocery store growth. While the non-fuzzy variable fill each 
perspective determined by the domain expert. From the simulation results based on the data on respondents 
number 1 (one) for the final value (Na) of 84.0625 by using rounding integers to 84, then when using the 
rules of membership functions, the calculation is as follows: μ_ (Less) [x] = 0; x≥75, so the result is 0, μ
_ (Enough) [x] = ((85-x)) / 10; 75 ≤x ≤85, so the result is 0.1, μ_ (Good) [x] = ((x-75)) / 10; 75 ≤x ≤85, so 
the result is 0.9. The results concluded that the performance of MSMEs in this respondent is ""GOOD"", and 
this is accordance to the results of the liner regression calculation which also shows the ""GOOD"" category 
results.

ABSTRACT 
Over the decades, the lean philosophy has been successfully adopted by many companies across a broad 
spectrum of industries. In recent years there has been a drive to adopt a more lean approach both in the manufacturing 
and testing of products. Performance in today’s testing facilities tends to be negatively affected by a number of issues. 
XYZ Electronics Corporation, as the market leader and global supplier in the industry for more than sixty five years, 
integrated approaches to keep their proven track record of quality excellence, thus the birth of Incoming Quality 
Control (IQC) Department. IQC is experiencing performance issues due to volatile workload that is affecting the 
whole operation.  
The study aims to reinforce the goal of the company towards operational excellence by addressing the 
performance issues and improving the capability, capacity and competency of IQC Department in terms of systems 
improvement. 
The study made use of interview, questionnaire, observation and document analysis in order to acquire 
information. Monte Carlo Simulation, Queuing Theory and levelling strategy are employed to analyze the data.  
After analyzing all gathered data, the results showed that the OGP equipment is over utilized due to current 
sample size scheme, no alternative tool used for dimension inspection and no predefined schedule per department. 
With these information, the researcher came up with the following solutions to address the equipment overutilization 
problem: implement schedule adjustments, utilization of alternative tools and design of new sampling plan.

Abstract 
Creating smart cities has grown to be vital in achieving sustainability in urban development. Further, it 
urges the necessity of initiating smart cities to overcome the issues owned by the rapid urbanization of 
countries. Initiating smart cities has become a trend in the modern world as it benefits in widespread 
connectivity and drive effective action, which is important for sustainable urban development. However, 
enabling smart cities is one of major challenges faced by countries. As previous researches stated, smart 
cities require funding and partnerships for its survival. Further, the need for policy changes, limited capital 
availability, political uncertainties and disorganized funding structures could also prevent investing in smart 
cities. Hence, identifying drivers and barriers for enabling smart cities has become paramount to study, thus 
selected as the main purpose of this research paper. Accordingly, an extensive literature survey was 
conducted. Fifty-two (52) key literature projects from recognised databases were critically reviewed to 
identify the concept of smart city, and the drivers and barriers for initiating smart cities. Finally, the most 
and least drivers and barriers were determined based on the critical review of literature. The probable 
strategies were also proposed as the main implication of this research which may ensure enabling smart 
cities.

1. Introduction
United Nations world population prospects distinguished that the world population will increase between 1950 and 
2100 by 8.7 billion people and future population growth will be in urban areas (Heilig 2015). According to While and 
Whitehead (2013), the emergence of climate change is determined as a threat to socio ecological sustainability in the 
world. With the increasing rate of urbanisation, urban areas face the challenge of achieving sustainable development 
within the cities (Ju-raschek et al. 2018). Rapid urbanisation in the developed world throughout the mid-20th century 
has shifted to the developing regions of Asia, Latin America and Africa (Zevenbergen, et al. 2008). Remark-ably, 
Asian region is identified as a rapidly urbanizing region where, placing sustainability in cities is an important aspect 
which is required to be concerned (Ooi 2009). As stated by Schaffers, et al. (2011), smart cities is an ideological 
solution for sustainable urban development. In the drive to become smart, cities will have to face certain barriers 
(Allwinkle and Cruickshank 2011). Naphade, et al. (2011) stated that, smarter city initiatives often require extensive 
coordination, sponsorship and support across multiple functional silos. Many researchers have identified the 
importance of stakeholder management for the success of projects (Yang, et al. 2009). Moreover, Bakıcı, et al. (2013) 
identified that lack of skilled human capital, low level of local entrepreneurship and innovation, lack of project capital 
funding and global connectivity as barriers in initiating smart cities. With the growing requirement of smart cities, it 
is useful to review on the strategies, which can be utilized to enhance the initiation of smart cities. Hence, it was the

Abstract 
The construction industry, being the largest industry, generates massive quantities of Construction and Demolition 
(C&D) waste. Generation of C&D waste leads to issues related to environmental pollution, adverse health issues, 
economic issues, social issues, and undesirable landfill creations. Strategies such as the 3R concept (Reduce, Reuse, 
Recycle), and waste hierarchy are followed in the construction industry for C&D waste management. Although such 
strategies are applied to manage the C&D waste, C&D waste management is still in a primary stage. In order to 
eliminate C&D waste, the Zero waste concept emerged as a potential solution. Zero waste means the elimination of 
waste through redesigning the product lifecycle. Strategies such as eco-design, industrial symbiosis, closed-loop 
supply chain management, innovative technology, product stewardship, life-cycle assessment, and environmental 
management system (EMS) are employed to implement the zero waste concept in the construction industry. Although 
adopting zero waste concept in the construction industry has several benefits, only limited studies could be found on 
zero waste management in the construction industry. Therefore, this paper aims to review the available strategies to 
implement zero waste concept in the construction industry by critically reviewing the secondary data on waste 
management studies performed in the construction industry.  
Keywords : 
Construction Industry, Construction and Demolition Waste, Zero Waste, Strategies 
1.0. Introduction 
The construction industry is considered a key economic driver in an economy with its considerable contribution to the 
gross national product along with employment and business opportunities (Sapuay 2016). However, the construction 
industry is also one of the largest polluters and faces the challenges regarding the reducing of construction waste 
generation (Banihashemi et al. 2018; Elgizawy et al.2016). As defined by Kofoworola and Gheewala (2008), 
Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste mean the waste generated through new construction, demolition, and 
renovation activities of structures and buildings. C&D waste comprise of concrete, bricks, tiles, ceramics, and gypsum-
based materials, wood, glass, plastic, electrical wiring, asphalt, tar and tarred products, metals soil and dredged soil, 
insulation materials, mixed C&D, and hazardous components (Elgizawy et al. 2016, Ghosh and Ghosh 2016; Hsiao 
et al. 2002). Although many researchers have attempted to manage C&D waste since the 1980s, still, it remains in a 
primary stage (Hao et al. 2007).  
As depicted in literature, the lack of interest of contractors, poor knowledge in the designing stage, use of low-quality 
products and lack of expertise in material handling, and issues related to the delivery of materials has led to the 
generation of C&D waste (Kofoworola and Gheewala 2008). Poor C&D waste management has led to environmental 
impacts, health issues, land depletion, soil and water pollution, and economic impacts (Coelho and Brito 2012; 
Elgizawy et al. 2016; Lingard et al. 2000; Nitivattananon and Borongan 2007; Wahi et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2010; 
Yeheyis et al. 2013). In order to manage the C&D waste, various strategies, i.e., 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), waste 
hierarchy, client awareness, and zero waste concept are being followed (Ling and Nguyen 2013; Nitivattananon and 
Borongan, 2007; Zaman 2015). As Zaman (2015) mentioned, the Zero waste is a perfectionistic concept to address 
the critical waste issue in the society. 
By challenging the traditional waste management method, zero waste concept converts waste into useful resources 
(Curran and Williams 2012; Ksiazek et al. 2016; Pietzsch et al. 2017). Further, Curran and Williams (2012) define 
Zero Waste as the redesigning of resources to reduce the harmful impacts to the environment through the emissions 
and to minimize resource wastage through a whole system approach. Thus, the implementation of zero waste concept

Abstract 
The growing demand for sustainable Food Supply Chains (FSCs) is steering adoption of sustainable practices. 
Adoption alone cannot reap the desired benefits, lest it is followed by evaluation and re-examination of the practices. 
This study proposes an analytical policy framework for the adoption of sustainable innovation practices (SIPs) in the 
Flour Milling sector with the help of an illustration of an Indian flour mill. In the pursuit for sustainability, the 
company implemented few SIPs and embracing of these practices has influenced the decisions within the strategic, 
operational and tactical domains of the company. Hence, investigation and identification of SIPs that have had an 
insightful impact on the sustainable performance of the company is needed. Best-Worst method, a multi-criteria 
technique, ideally suited in decision making environment involving multiple decision makers with conflicting 
judgments, is adopted in the present study for evaluation of SIPs. The final inference is that ‘Increasing 
sustainability awareness’ is the most important SIP, having the maximum social and environmental impact with 
minimum economic input. The outcomes of this case-based study can be utilized as reference for other industry 
managers to make key strategic decisions regarding practical implementation of SIPs, with an objective to enhance 
sustainability of their FSC.

Introduction of sustainable food safety measures ranks 9th. This in no way implies that this SIP is not be continued. 
It only gives an indication that this SIP has led to only a marginal improvement in the sustainable output of the SC 
as compared to the last assessment report.

BWM method has proved to be an effective MCDM too for finding a compromised ranking for the SIP’s based on 
their economic, environmental and social performance. It gives a clear idea to the DMs about which SIPs should be 
carried on and which need more improvement. If they are adopted effectively by the DMs, then it can be 
instrumental for the company in the overall sustainable performance of the FSC. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The study has attempted to present a MCDM model for performance evaluation of Sustainability Innovation 
Practices implemented in the wheat milling sector with specific fact findings of Delhi flour Mills Company. The 
company faces a tough task of attaining a productive FSC while striking a balance between complying with the 
sustainability regulations enforced by the government and the pressure exerted by the stakeholders. As a 
consequence, the challenge which lies further ahead for the company is to investigate and identify the SIPs that have 
had an insightful impact in the last assessment year on the sustainable performance of the company so that key 
decisions can be made for the next year. Nine key ongoing SIPs are identified and analyzed for their impact on the 
overall sustainability performance of the SC. The motivation behind the study was to provide an analytical 
framework to DMs so that existing policies can be modified subject to the constraints of cost-efficiency and 
sustainable productivity of the ongoing SIPs, keeping in mind the stakeholders’ interest and arriving on key 
decisions for broadening the spectrum of sustainability.  Therefore, performance evaluation of the SIPs are done 
based on significant reduction of the total energy use and the greenhouse emissions of the SC along-with 
enhancement of social wellbeing, within the budgetary constraints of the company. Since sustainability is a multi-
criteria concept, therefore, to assess the relevance of each SIP as compared to each other and within the context of 
overall sustainability, a recently developed multi-criteria method called the Best-Worst method is used. To evaluate 
and improve the current practices and processes, the DMs are asked to identify the best (most desirable), and the 
worst (least desirable) SIPs, followed by a pairwise vector comparison of best SIP and worst SIP with others. The 
weights of the SIPs are generated by solving a max-min model. Then, the weights of the economic, environmental 
and social performance are obtained using the same procedure. Finally, significance of the SIPs is obtained in the 
aggregation phase in terms of their importance to the organizational sustainability of the supply chain. The 
consistency ratio is also checked for the reliability of the comparisons made. The final inference obtained is that 
‘Use of Energy Efficient Equipment’ is the most important sustainability initiative which has maximum long-term 
social, environmental and economic benefits. The outcomes of this study will help industry managers, decision-
makers and practitioners decide where to channelize their resources during the next stage of implementation of SIPs, 
with an objective to enhance sustainability in their supply chain and move towards sustainable development

Abstract 
The existing ecological imbalance along with the rising social disparities are driving companies towards 
consideration of adoption of sustainability driven supply chain (SC) strategies which aim at a holistic integration of 
the economic, ecological and social enhancement of the overall SC. However, the challenge lies in consideration of 
Triple Bottom Line (TBL). Further, increasing demand from stakeholders for accountability of the sustainability 
practices has put immense pressure on companies for assessment of their SC activities in terms of sustainability. 
However in few developing nations like India, even though companies are required to examine the environmental as 
well as social ramifications of their SC activities, most firms are still focused more on the economic productivity. 
This brings us to the motivation behind this research, in which a multi-criteria analytical framework is developed for 
a manufacturing firm for identifying the sustainability practices, which can aid the firm in simultaneously improving 
on TBL. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) is utilized for establishing relationships between sustainability 
strategies identified through extensive literature review and semi-structured interviews with decision makers. 
Through the analysis of the ISM model developed for the case-based study, it is validated that environmental and 
social sustainability enables economic sustainability in the long run.

1. Introduction
Escalating consciousness of the decision makers regarding environmental and social issues has encouraged most 
manufacturing companies to increase its attention on adoption of sustainability practices, Darbari et al. (2017). In 
particular, the growing stakeholder awareness in India is driving the manufacturers to incorporate sustainability into 
their business, Govindan et al. (2017). The literature has analyzed various factors for implementing sustainable 
practices for different industries. For instance, Diabat et al. (2011) analyzed the driving factors for carrying out 
sustainability practices in Indian textile sector. The results show that social sustainability is mainly focused upon due 
to factors such as employees' involvement, stability and community economic in case of textile industries. Darbari et 
al. (2016), identified crucial factors for social sustainability in reverse supply chain for electronics industry. The 
study concluded that top management commitment, government support and stakeholder empowerment are the most 
imperative and essential facilitators for achieving the desired social performance level for Reverse Logistics (RL) 
system. Kausar et al. (2016), Investigated the key drivers towards sustainability in supply chain (SC) for various

5. Discussions and Conclusion 
 
Continuous environmental deterioration and depletion of natural resources are forcing nations to look into 
innovative ways for incorporating sustainability practices. Governments are hence enforcing strict regulations on the 
firms to resonate sustainability into their SC that will result in economical, ecological and social benefits. 
Environmental improvements for nations like India are not only essential to attract new customers but also for a 
sound future. Identification and effective implementation of the right sustainability practices is still a challenge for 
most firms, particularly in the developing nations. In order to overcome this problem, our research seeks to identify 
the strategies of sustainability for firms in India and analyze interrelationships among them. Further the study helps 
in identifying those strategies that can aid an Indian electronics-component manufacturing firm to achieve overall 
sustainability of the value chain. ISM methodology is implemented for this purpose along with MICMAC analysis. 
A total of 18 strategies are identified from rigorous literature survey, which are used for evaluation of sustainability 
performance of the SC.  The study resulted in the following observations:   
 
MICMAC analysis shows that none of the strategy was obtained in the autonomous-quadrant and only three 
strategies were in the dependent-quadrant which shows that there is less instability among the selected ones. That 
means waste reduction, supply chain risk and customer satisfaction need better attention by DMs, as there is still 
scope for improvement in them. Linkages-quadrant consists of maximum number of strategies, as this quadrant 
illustrates high driving/dependence power, which clearly shows the potential of these strategies in influencing the 
overall SC performance. Further, strategies constituted in the independent-quadrant holds most importance, as 
focusing more on these can lead the electronics-component manufacturing firm towards higher sustainability score.       
 
The relationships among the strategies are demonstrated with the help of the diagraph (Figure 2). Implication drawn 
from the model is that Government rewards and recognition, management commitment and customer involvement 
are most essential strategies for the firm. So a firm working towards making its practices environment friendly, 
incorporating all the parameters defined by the government, gets recognized and rewarded. ISM model shows a 
practical case of an Indian electronics-component manufacturing firm, which will help DMs for focusing on 
improving those sustainability strategies that will eventually aid in improving the overall performance of the firm.  
 
Our study can be applied to the general electronics industry. Although the DMs’ opinions may change as per each 
firm’s requirements, however the validity of the judgments can be checked used structural equation modeling (SEM) 
in future.

Abstract 
In general, the foundations used for the simple development of Indonesian society are stone foundation 
times. The availability of stone times will be reduced if there is no innovation in the foundation. The 
requirements for this foundation will be experienced if the availability of workers is limited. This study 
aims to overcome the problem of skilled workers who are able to make a foundation. One way is to 
change the foundation of the time by making a precast hole foundation. The material used in this 
experiment is a comparison of ordinary concrete with plastic mixed concrete. The composition of the 
concrete mixture is 1: 2: 3 and concrete with material added to 1.97 kg of plastic waste (5% by weight of 
cement) and concrete additives (0.25% of the total volume of concrete). The results obtained from the 
comparison of the concrete composition are concrete concrete made from plastic and additive at the age 
of 14 and 28 days at 1.81 Kg / cm2 and 2.15 Kg / cm2, while the precast foundation test material for 
plastic waste added 5% + concrete additive 0.25% at the age of 14 and 28 days at 2.83 Kg / cm2 and 3.40 
Kg / cm2. These results indicate that this foundation is capable of being used in small-scale house 
construction.

Abstract 
Food Park concept started out in the Philippines in 2016 and has conquered the food and beverage industry in the 
country. Throughout this year, food parks and food trucks alike have sprouted in every corner of the metro. In a report 
by Manila Times Business, demand for sites for building food parks saw a significant rise in the country, mainly 
driven by the millennial market (Yu, 2017). However, regulations regarding food safety and hygiene are poorly 
observed in the food parks. As such, increasing incidence of foodborne diseases and foodborne illnesses were reported. 
This study therefore aims to evaluate the current food safety practice of food park industry in the country and develop 
a food safety plan in order to minimize the occurrence of risk for foodborne diseases and illnesses. The study made 
use of service blueprinting in order to identify the failure points in the food handling process and rubrics-scoring 
method was used in order to identify indicators in food handling and preparation that contribute to foodborne diseases. 
Finally, statistical analyses such as analysis of variance and regression analysis were utilized in order to determine 
significant factors in food handling and preparation that directly contribute to prevalence of foodborne diseases. The 
factors identified in the study will serve as the basis for the authors to develop a food safety plan for food parks. The 
food safety plan consists of policies and procedures for food handling and preparation, which consists of personal 
hygiene of food handler, food hygiene and safety practices, use of materials, and management of leftovers/trash. The 
findings showed the inadequacy and lapses in the current food safety practices in food parks, showing the relationship 
of food-borne diseases and its occurrence in different indicators that are common to food service today.

1. Introduction
The industry that deals with the preparation and selling of food items and products refers to the food service industry. 
Like in other countries, the food industry has developed very well in the Philippines and, according to the nationwide 
Census of Philippine Business and Industry, the country’s food service industry amounts to roughly US$7.2 Billion 
with an estimated 15% to 20% annual growth over the past decades (Asia's Ethnice Food & Ingredients Show IFEX 
Philippines, n.d.). The Philippine consumer food service industry have 80,813 outlets. By subsector, it is composed 
of the fast food, full-service restaurants, cafés/bars, street stalls/kiosks, and home delivery/takeaway. Most recently 
with the rising demand for convenience and the huge influence of social media in marketing, this led to the expansion 
of the food service industry in the form of food parks. Millennial-driven food parks are continuously expanding in the 
retail property market. The food park trend serves as an opportunity for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), 
giving them opportunity to thrive and profit from a captive market setup with lower costs compared with traditional 
establishments such as standalone stores, food courts and malls. The setting up is affordable, flexible and fast 
compared with setting up in malls. Food parks have been trending over the past two years and continues to grow in 
numbers, with the majority of them located in urban communities such as Quezon City and Marikina. The food park 
concept itself is novel and the variety of selection can encourage customers to try it at least once (AURE, 2017). In a 
food park, a great variety of food are offered and served including desserts, main courses, international and local 
delicacies, liquors and non-alcoholic beverages, ready-to-eat foods and other street foods. Each tenant or food stall in 
a food park have their own service process, food handling, preparation, and serving. The tenants must provide safe 
food to the customers, which is totally dependent on the quality of raw materials, food preparation and handling. In

4. Conclusion 
 
The findings have shown the inadequacy and lapses in the current food safety practices in food parks, showing the 
relationship with food-borne diseases that are common to food service today. Among the significant variables is how 
the food handlers’ hygienic practices and attitude towards food safety affects the safety of food items such as cooked 
food, dessert, and beverages being sold in different stalls in food parks, which can lead to health hazards such as 
infections and diseases. Although most food parks are checked by the respective local government they operate in 
before the issuance of health and sanitary permits, not all are kept monitored on a regular basis thus resulting to lapses 
in the food parks’ safety procedures in food handling and processing. Lapses in food handling and processing can 
result to food-borne diseases, with some being easily transferred through physical contact and others through cross 
contamination. Some of these food-borne diseases can be as simple as Salmonella, which usually results to vomiting 
and stomach ache, but there are also much severe diseases like E. Coli which may result to kidney failure and even 
fatality in much severe cases. 
 
Based on the results, it is evident that failures by food handlers to do their tasks properly, which involves food handling 
and processing as well as their personal hygiene, can easily lead to cross contamination and infections on the food 
items. It is also significant to understand that all the materials and equipment used in food handling and processing 
also affects the safety of the food items being sold in food parks. That is why proper cleaning and maintenance of 
materials and equipment are very important aspects in food safety. 
 
The researchers used service blueprints to observe and identify the failure points in food handling and processing 
common in food parks, and utilized a checklist based from a food safety study conducted in Nigeria and modified it 
to better fit the specific needs of food parks, with tasks containing different variables grouped together. The results 
showed low scores on variables related mostly to food hygiene, personal hygiene, materials handling, leftovers and 
trash management. Existing personal gears for food handlers such as hairnet, hand gloves and spit guard are not usually 
available or used in food parks, which if used properly can help in prevention of cross contamination, infection and 
spread of diseases. Some food handlers also commit mistakes in separating raw and cooked food items, which can 
easily cause cross contamination. Materials handling, trash and leftover management are also some of the overlooked 
variables in food safety, which if not properly taken care of may cause cross contamination to food items and become 
a place of incubation for bacteria and pathogens.

With this, the researchers have identified the significant variables in food safety and the relation to food-borne 
diseases, which can be avoided by proper food handling and processing. The researchers want to address these issues 
to the different stalls in food parks and help them improve and have a food safety plan allowing them to assess and 
monitor their own processes. A food safety plan does not only provide the proper procedures for the different tasks in 
food handling and processing, but also acts as a preventive control by including process and sanitation control charts 
which can be used by the food handlers in their implementation. 
 
With the overall findings, the researchers may conclude that following procedures revolving around the basic 
principles of food safety and implementing preventive controls will decrease the chances of cross contamination and 
food-borne diseases.

Abstract 
This study aims to design an ergonomic birthing chair for public maternity hospitals in the Philippines in order to 
provide comfort for patients and maternity healthcare workers. Previous studies prove that for normal delivery, patients 
giving birth in sitting position provides 30% more ease compared to lateral position. In addition, healthcare workers 
are also exposed to less risk for musculoskeletal disorders if they are in sitting position when assisting patients 
compared to standing position. In this regard, the researchers intend to design an ergonomic birthing chair for patients 
with an adjustable chair for healthcare workers by applying the principles of anthropometry that is fit for Filipino 
users. Ergonomic assessment tools such as CMDQ and RULA were used in order to determine the risks of workers 
for MSD due to the current design of birthing bed for normal delivery. Statistical tools such as analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) and correlation analysis were also used in order to determine significant factors that contribute to the MSDs 
of healthcare workers in maternity hospitals. The result of CMDQ and RULA indicated that musculoskeletal disorders 
are evident in the following: (a) obstetricians: wrist (95.2%), thighs (86.9%), shoulders (69.05%), forearms (60.7%) 
and lower back (52.4%); (b) midwives: knees (81.5%), wrists (78.8%), lower back (72.4%) and shoulders (72%). 
Statistical analysis proved that task factors such as positioning, supporting baby’s head as it emerges, supporting 
baby’s neck using both hands, delivering placenta and final positioning significantly contributes to the MSD 
experienced by workers. Thus, the new design of birthing chair proves significant reduction of MSDs for healthcare 
workers and provides more comfort for patients.

1. Introduction
Birthing chair is a device that is shaped to assist women in the physiological upright posture during childbirth. It is 
intended to provide balance and support for patients when delivering babies. In a study by Yap (1996) states that the 
posture adopted by the mother during labor is considered to be the most important factor for the safe passage of fetus 
through birth canal. Based on studies, the natural and most effective posture in giving birth is upright position – sitting, 
squatting, kneeling or standing. The supine position for this delivery facilitates the management of labor and provides 
physiological advantages for mothers and fetuses compared to lateral position. The advantages of upright position for 
labor includes: gravitational forces to promote fetal descent; preventing compression of aorta; inferior umbilical cord; 
increased size of pelvic inlet; promoting more effective bearing down-effort and promoting more efficient contraction. 
In terms of physiological responses, laboring in the seated position has been found to promote active participation, 
control and emotional satisfaction (Yap, 1996).   
The problems affecting childbirth could be most appropriately studied within the confines of human-machine 
environment system, or the Ergonomics approach. The International Ergonomic Association (IEA) defined 
ergonomics as the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other 
elements of a system, and the profession that applies theoretical principles, data and methods to the design in order to 
optimize human well-being and overall system performance. Ergonomists contribute to the design and evaluation of 
tasks, jobs, products, environments and system in order to make them compatible with the needs, abilities and 
limitation of people (Karwowski, 2000).

The design of the birthing chair includes an adjustable opening angle of the pushing handles that provide variation in 
use during the pushing phase based on the height and preferences of the patient. The arm supports offer an opportunity 
to relax in the opening phase of the delivery process. The seat opening offers space for the midwife and obstetricians 
to assist with the childbirth. Two wheels that turn make steering the birthing support possible. The birthing support 
can be equipped with an adjustable infusion stand, pushing straps to enhance the leverage force of the mother and a 
safety harness. Features of the birthing chair also includes a combined headrest, pushing handles, adjustable seat, arm 
support, inclined backrest, and backrest side handles.  
  
4. Conclusion  
  
Based on the result of the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn. First, the result of CMDQ revealed that 
obstetricians and midwives experienced musculoskeletal disorders due to current design of birthing facility in the 
public hospitals in the Philippines. The RULA analysis proved that the subjects were exposed to awkward postures 
and use of muscular force, hence, are exposed to risks for upper limb disorders. The result of the regression analysis 
showed that the following tasks significantly contribute to the musculoskeletal disorders of the subjects: positioning, 
supporting baby’s head as it emerges, supporting baby’s neck using both hands, delivering placenta and final 
positioning. With that, the researchers were able to come up with an ergonomic design of birthing chair focusing on 
the tasks that contribute to the musculoskeletal disorders of the subjects. The design is based on the anthropometric 
measurements gathered from the subjects of the study and using AutoCad software, the researchers made a mock-up 
design prototype.

Abstract 
Toll booth operators are exposed to number of occupational risks due to the nature of their work. According to Bureau 
of Labor and Employment Statistics, a total of 968 cases of occupational injuries and 1,010 cases of Musculoskeletal 
Disorders (MSD) were recorded for workers in toll operations (BLES, 2011). Thus, this paper aims to investigate 
issues surrounding toll booth operators ’comfortability and safety. The main objective of this study is to provide 
solutions in order to minimize the prevalence of MSDs in the operations of toll road industry, particularly, to the 
current line of work of Filipino toll booth tellers. The researcher selected North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) as a model 
representation of other toll road companies here in the country since the highest volume of vehicles were passing along 
NLEX road. Ergonomic assessment tools and statistical analyses were used for the investigation. Based on the result 
of the study, it was found that the workers in the toll road industry were exposed to musculoskeletal disorders such as 
pain in lower back, upper back, shoulders, neck, and hips/buttocks. Similarly, based on the result of Rapid Upper 
Limb Assessment (RULA), the current working posture of toll booth operators could pose high level of work-related 
upper limb disorders due to the poor design of facility. Given this situation, an ergonomically designed toll booth was 
proposed. The design was based from the analysis of the study – respondent survey, anthropometric measurement, 
identified significant risk factors of MSD, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) matrix, and results of physical 
working environment assessment. It was suggested that the proposed design must be constructed in the near future for 
greater benefit over the present design in terms of comfortability and safety of toll booth operators.

1. Introduction
Toll booth is a small structure on some highways and bridges which is used to collect fees. It is operated by a toll teller 
that usually spend long hours of shift working inside just to collect money and/or tickets from highway motorists. 
Based on review of related literatures, toll booth operators/tellers are exposed to number of occupational risks due to 
the nature of their work. In the Philippines, operations related to toll roads and bridges are classified under Support 
Activities for Transportation. In 2011 statistical data of Bureau of Labor and Employment Statistics (BLES) for 
occupational injuries and disease, they have recorded 968 cases of occupational injuries with frequency rate, incidence 
rate, severity rate, and average days lost of 4.35, 10.77, 24.31, and 6.43 respectively. However, for work-related 
musculoskeletal diseases, they recorded 1,010 cases. 5 (0.5%) for carpal tunnel syndrome, 42 (4.16%) for shoulder 
tendinitis, 230 (22.77%) for neck-shoulder pain, 632 (62.57%) for back pain, and lastly, 101 (10%) for other work-
related musculoskeletal diseases. In the health survey conducted by Strauss, Orris, and Buckley (1992) among 207 
toll booth workers, it showed that 43.2% of their respondents had a high prevalence of central nervous system 
complaints (headaches, irritability, or anxiety, and unusual tiredness), mucous membrane irritation (eye irritation, 
nasal congestion, and dry throat), and musculoskeletal problems (joint and back pains). However, the common body 
parts of the toll booth workers that experienced discomfort as identified by Day, Hartman, and Casper (1996) in their 
study were: (1.) Neck; (2.) Upper and Lower Back; (3.) Upper Arm; (4.) Wrist; and (5.) Ankle. Both of the previous 
researchers concluded that further study into the musculoskeletal issues was needed to be done. From the statistical 
tables on nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses requiring days away from work of U.S. Bureau of Labor and 
Statistics (2012), they tallied a total of 4,500 cases of Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in this kind of job in private 
transportation industry. Also, during that year they recorded an incident rate and median days away from work of 22.6 
and 10 respectively. While for occupational injuries, they recorded 8,960 cases with incident rate and median days

4. Conclusion 
 
The study proves that MSDs exist to the current line of work of Filipino toll tellers.  Aside from exposure to this kind 
of occupational risk factors, the toll tellers were prone to the other risks from the different environmental factors (i.e. 
acoustical, thermal, and visual). Based from the results of ManTRA for toll fee collection task, the subjects were also 
exposed to repetition and exertion risks. The statistical tool such as Multiple Regression Analysis is a great tool for 
identifying the contributing factors to the severity of MSDs experienced by the subjects. The recommended design of 
toll booth can be used as reference material for its construction in the different areas of the Philippines. For this greatly 
reduced existence of MSDs (Final RULA Score reduced to 3 and 4) and at the same time keeps the workers from the 
risk of other injuries.

Abstract  
This research investigates whether given set of dining attributes tend to satisfy casual-dining customers, examines for 
other satisfaction factors, filters satisfaction from retention, and determines the weights and ranks of each of these 
retention factors. This research gathers factors that promote not just satisfaction but also retention for casual-dining 
customers, and to set prioritization standards for any casual-dining restaurants. For this research, sample size of 400 
casual-dining customers has been surveyed in order to reduce variability. Correlation analysis was used in order to 
determine the significant relationship of dining attributes to the satisfaction level of casual-dining customers.  
Herzberg’s two factor theory model was also applied to determine satisfaction and retention ratio of dining customers. 
Similarly, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determine and assign weights for each attributes identified 
in the study. Results of the study indicates that major attributes that contribute to the satisfaction of casual-dining 
customers are food quality, physical environment design, price and value of food and employee service. On the other 
hand, based on Herzberg’s two factor theory model and AHP, the top 5 sub-factors that need to be prioritized in order 
to ensure retention of casual-dining customers are food taste, food presentation, restaurant location, food price and 
freshness of ingredients while the least 5 sub-factors that do not affect the satisfaction and retention of customers are 
convenient hours, ease of access of menu, staff appearance, attentive and accommodating staff and delighters. This 
study will help casual-dining restaurants’ management to avoid greater risks when it comes to budget allocation, 
investments, and customer retention planning.

1. Introduction
Food always plays a fundamental role in the lives of human being. The foodservice business today recognized as a 
global economic industry, with producers and consumers stretch around the world (Hanafiah, Harun & Jamaluddin, 
2010). This development can be distinguished from the selection of foodservice establishments blooming in all 
subsectors of the industry, ranging from hotels, food retail, catering, health foodservice, food manufacturing and 
restaurants (Jin, Line & Merkebu, 2015). The food industry has become highly aggressive as customers have become 
more demanding due to sufficient knowledge and information they have about the different trends of restaurant which 
causes marketers to implement effective marketing strategies to get the competitive advantage and better understand 
the needs and wants of the customers (Owour, Alwar & Oyugi, 2015). Kapoor & Solomon (2011) highlighted that 
most successful restaurants compete on the basis of their ability to deliver outstanding service. In other words, 
restaurant industry derives success from their capability to deliver satisfying experiences to customers. Nevertheless, 
even in the luxurious restaurant with the best customer-oriented strategic plans and the tightest quality control systems, 
flawless service delivery cannot be assured (Chen & Kim, 2017).  
Restaurant industry, which involves a great amount of personal interaction among restaurants staff and customers, 
cannot avoid errors, mistakes, failures, and complaints in the process of service delivery. Service delivery failures can 
put restaurants out of business by neglecting the cause of failure (Ekiz, 2012). Businesses like restaurants are

On the other hand, in order to identify which attributes need to be prioritized, Analytical Hierarchy Process was used 
in order to assign weights on the attributes based on importance set by the customers. The result of the analysis is

Based on the result, among the 4 main factors, Food Quality ranked the highest followed up by Physical Environment, 
Price – Value, and lastly, Management Service. Food Quality’s output weight is almost half of the total weight of 4 
factors which tells how important Food Quality for the customers of the casual-dining restaurants to retain. The next 
process was to get the weights and ranks of sub-factors for each main factor. For the Physical Environment, Placement 
or Location ranked as 1 with a weight of 38% while the last rank was the Delighters which covers having TV, games, 
live band or etc. with a weight of 4%. For the Management Service factor, Friendliness of Staffs ranked highest with 
a weight of 35% while the last is Convenient Hours with a weight of 3%. For the Food Quality factor, Tasty Food 
ranked the highest with a weight of 41% while the last is Variety of Food Options with a weight of 6%. For the Price 
– Value factor, the highest rank is the Food Price with a weight of 54% while the factor that ranked the lowest is the 
Promo Services with a weight of 16%. After generating the sub-factors’ weight and rank per main factor, the 
researchers generated their overall weight and rank against other sub-factors by multiplying sub-factor’s weight from 
the main factor’s weight. The overall rank 1 resulted to Tasty Food with a weight of 19.24% while the factor that 
ranked last which is 22nd is Convenient Hours with a weight of 0.44%.

The researchers were able to identify prioritization of service quality dimensions towards customer retention in 
casualdining restaurants. Based on data analysis from 400 respondents, the following conclusions were drawn. First, 
based on the initial survey, the satisfaction level of customers based on the performance of casual-dining restaurants 
in Metro Manila are above average. The attribute with the highest satisfaction rating is ease of access to the menu, 
followed by tasty food, convenient restaurant hours and meal size, while attributes with lowest satisfaction rating are 
convenient parking, beverage price, senior & PWD prioritization and delighters. Similarly, the result of correlation 
analysis proved that satisfaction attributes that have strong significant relationship to the retention of customers to the 
casualdining restaurants are tasty food and food price while satisfaction attributes that have moderate significant 
relationship to retention of customers are convenient parking, variety of food options, freshness of ingredients, food 
presentation and promo services. And finally, based on Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) model, the top 5 attributes 
that need to be prioritized to ensure customer retention are the following: tasty food, food presentation, restaurant 
location, food price and freshness of ingredients.

Abstract 
Public transportation has been evolving through the past years. The latest mode of transportation is the application 
based rides also known as the transport network vehicle services. It has always been the safety of the passenger that 
is being prioritized. Drivers’ health condition should also be taken into consideration especially now that there are an 
increasing number of deaths among the drivers due to accidents mainly caused by fatigue. In this regard, the study 
aims to determine factors affecting the fatigue condition of drivers in order to ensure the safety of drivers and their 
passengers. The study also aims to design a smart watch that will monitor the fatigue level of drivers in order to 
prevent untoward incidents that will affect the safety of both drivers and passengers. Factors such as blood pressure, 
heart rate and oxygen level were considered in the study. The researchers made use of statistical analysis such as 
analysis of variance, correlation and regression in order to determine which factors are significant predictors of the 
fatigue level of drivers and thus, the factors identified will be considered in the design of the smart watch that will 
monitor the fatigue level of drivers.

1. Introduction
Transportation in the country has a major role in the daily activities of people. Public transportation has evolved these 
past few years. In the urban public transit, there are buses, trains and cabs (Teodorović & Janić, 2017). Public 
transportation brought a lot of opportunities for the rapid growth of demand for smartphones (Dickinson et.al, 2015). 
Nowadays, there are other modes of public transportation that have been modified. One of these is the application-
based ride services. The involvement of public in transportation through social media is attaining much favor in the 
government that focuses on the translucency and involvement of the public in any ways. (Majumdar, 2016). 
Transportation have made it workable for government agencies to utilize social media sites like Facebook, Twitter 
and the like through the current developments in technology particularly in the communications (Criado, 2013). 
Application based ride companies like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar were able to manage drivers of private vehicles to 
provide safe, well founded service, reasonable fares for the riders with just an application through smartphone (Flores 
& Rayle, 2017). Based on a survey conducted, the stability of the taxi application based services are dependent on the 
consistent use of the riders. The survey showed that the technology has an intensive effect in the stability of the taxi 
application based service companies (Weng et.al, 2017). Because of increasing demand for this type of transport 
service, health risks for the drivers are also increasing.   
A study by Chung & Wu (2013) stated that the major health risk of public transport drivers are stress and fatigue. The 
primary strain for the factors of stress is the reward and over commitment levels of drivers in rendering services based 
on the booking quota of the company (Chung & Wu, 2013). This could negatively affect the safety and health of both 
drivers and passengers, and may cause road accidents (He et.al, 2016).  
Drivers for all types of vehicles have been experiencing fatigue due to long hours of driving for their daily work (Meng 
et.al, 2015). There is one major contributor to road accidents around the world due to fatigued driving. It was examined 
that despite of being fatigued, the driver still has the motivation to drive which led to a conclusion that behavior of the 
driver is a huge factor in fatigued driving (Jiang et.al, 2017).

4. Conclusion 
 
Based on the result of the study, the following conclusions were drawn: 
 
Correlation analysis was used to prove that factors in demographic, road and environmental that have significant 
relationship to the fatigue condition of the drivers in terms of the following: blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen 
level. Different factors and sub-factors were identified to have positive and negative correlation to the fatigue condition 
of the drivers.  
 
Regression model was developed in order to predict the heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen level of the drivers with 
the corresponding time of the day using regression analysis. These factors served as the basis for the researchers in 
designing a smart watch that will monitor the health condition of the drivers in order to ensure safety of both drivers 
and the passengers.  
 
Using the factors identified in the study, the researchers were able to come up with a proposed design of smart watch 
that will efficiently monitor the health condition of the drivers. The smart watch has a tracking device that records the 
blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen level of the user and has an supporting application that will send notification to 
the closest person of the user in case of emergencies. The smart watch sends alarm every time the user reach the 
critical level of heart rate, blood pressure or oxygen level and has a GPS that tracks the exact location of the user.

Abstract 
The growing industry of carrageenan continues to be characterized by small-scale farmer producers whose collective 
production of agar is the major supply source of the marine produce in the city.  However, the multiplicity of farmers 
engaged in the production contributes to what is an emerging industry in the city as it is in many southern islands.  The 
aggregate production of the agar farmers in the city is sufficient to make local farmers potentially competitive and a 
major source of supply for the marine product. Thus, the study aims to identify and evaluate the various factors to the 
market conditions of carrageenan in the southern Philippine area – production, price, and distribution channels – and 
to design solutions that would reduce the cost of distribution in the seaweed supply chain.  The process involved the 
conduct of a survey and interviews of several stakeholders in the industry who acted as the study’s key informants. 
Statistical tools and other analytical tools were likewise employed to further identify the factors that contribute to the 
current supply chain of the carrageenan industry in the country. Statistical tools were employed in the analyses to 
identify the factors and optimal distribution cost and based on the results.  Three specific areas were considered for 
the farmer-producers: quality standards, growth and maintenance, and harvest conditions.  As with the buyers: quality, 
transport, and selling.  The final group – the assemblers - the areas include quality, transport and selling.  However, 
the least two groups seemed almost identical, the specifics in each of the areas covered had varied operational 
conditions.  As with the farmers, 77% was lopsided for E. espinosum variety; 1005 for the use of the floating planting 
method, and 85% for water movement as a special maintenance concern of the plants.  In reference to growth and 
maintenance, a majority over 80% opted for planting of cultivars within the 1.5-2 meters deep and of cultivars within 
15 to 20 centimeters in length.  Farmers opt to do once a day inspection of the farms and there is almost 100% 
preference for still water conditions in the planting area; a significant 81% of framers prefer water temperature of 
around 25 degrees Celsius, salinity of 20-25 parts per million and all opt for sandy sea bottom. For the buyers, in 
reference to quality, a high 80% prefer agar to be sold to them with 25% moisture content; note that most sold to them 
are combined with sand; and prefer E. espinosum and E. cottonii.  In reference to transport, distance from farm to 
buying station is on the 16-km. distance on the average; the use of truck by all of them; and prefer that seaweeds be 
covered in the course of transport. With the assemblers and bodegas, all have shown preference for 25% moisture 
content of the agar and have noted the mix of sand in most of them; there is a very high preference for E. espinosum 
over other species; and their storage areas are 0ver 800 square meters.  In reference to distance, the similar 16 
kilometers average is noted; the trucks are generally covered during transport; and the movement of produce is done 
daily.  As with selling, storage prior to actual sale takes between 2 to 3 weeks; these are sacked; sale is preferably done 
during the drier days and frequency of sale is done twice to thrice a week.

1. Introduction
The seaweed supply chain in the Philippines is largely subject to disruptions in yield, quality, price, and infrastructures. 
The volatility of the market, compounded by uncontrollable natural interventions, creates unexpected downturns. If 
there is a disturbance in one part of the supply chain, it can affect the whole chain. To ensure a sustainable seaweed 
industry, long-term planning is needed. Here, supply chain risk management can help. In the process, four critical

4. Conclusion  
  
The current supply chain in terms of its structure is not the optimal for the sustainability and maximization of its 
potential. There are many aspects where in there are much room for improvement but the integration of technology 
for the farming practices shall greatly affect the supply chain in a positive way. The involvement of the government 
in terms of microfinancing the needs of the farmers, continued education of updated farming techniques and improving 
infrastructure around the area will greatly increase the chances of making the supply chain sustainable. Introducing 
the private sector to get involved shall promote the improvement of the quality of living of the players in the chain. 
The first objective of the study was to assess the prevailing supply chain of the carrageenan industry in the Zamboanga 
region. The data-gathering process involved the assessment of the industry on-site with the employment of 
observations and interviews with the sample of three groups of major seaweed industry players in Zamboanga City.  
While the agar industry may be “old” and familiar to much of the current farmers, the industry has since changed 
given the demands of the market.  It has become more specialized with the involvement of defined groups as the 
buyers and assemblers performing identified functions. The second objective of the study is to identify the factors 
affecting the supply chain. From careful research analysis, factors affecting quality, production volume and marketing 
were carefully investigated and analyzed.  From the standpoint of the Farmer-Producers, three areas were identified: 
Planting Quality Standards, Growth and Maintenance, and Harvest Conditions.  For the buyers, three factors were 
identified: Quality, Transport, and Selling.  The last group of players – the assemblers, also involved three areas closely 
similar to those of the Buyers: Quality, Transport, and Selling. The factors that were identified to be significant that 
has the most effect on the output of seaweed are the following: Species of seaweed, monitoring of the plantation, 
planting intervals, harvest months, and type of drying beds. The species of seaweed affects the production because 
different types have varying amounts of growth time. The monitoring of the plantation, specifically line inspection 
and deceases have significant effects because these can reduce the output if not monitored. Harvesting months and 
type of drying meds are also significant because post-harvest practices entails the drying of the seaweed. And seaweed 
cannot be sold if it contains high moisture contents, so preferred months are peak of summer and mode of dry are 
racks to minimize contamination. The third objective was to develop a supply chain model/framework and strategy to 
improve the industry performance. The development of a new value chain map, were in there are two major phases. 
Farming activities and Marketing activities. Under the farming activities, will fall under the supervision of a farming 
cooperative made up of the farmers themselves. The creation of the cooperative to watch over the farming activities 
to be better facilitate the farmers.  They could organize among themselves with government assistance.  This is wanting 
given the need for their increase bargaining position in the market – securing their products and their prices.  Moreover, 
they could be the more legitimate link to the actual local market. The intermediate marketing phase is focused on the 
domestic/local market that act as enablers and conduit to the assemblers, who, in turn links to the foreign market.  The 
first line of quality control is the local market who is aware of the foreign market requirements.  The major concern is 
the transport of the produce to the buyers/bodegas.  In all phases, quality must be carefully secured.  The “fate” of the 
farmers are ultimately sealed by the actual sale.  
  
The link to the assemblers is the beginning of the entry of the foreign market.  The assemblers hold the legitimate link 
to exportation where the ultimate crucible of quality is determined and reflected by the price paid for the produce.  
Again, the persistence of Quality is evaluated.

Abstract 
Driving is a primary task that requires full attention. However, several factors could cause distractions and affect the 
attention of drivers. Distractions come from both internal and external sources. Internal distractions happen when a 
person engages into distracting activities inside the vehicle (Beanland et al., 2013) while external distractions come 
from outside of the vehicle wherein there is a delay in recognition of information needed to safely accomplish the 
driving task because there are events, activities, object, or person outside the vehicle that tend to induce the driver to 
shift his attention away from the driving task (Regan et al., 2011). Both external and internal distractions contribute 
to the interference of focus (Post and Schumm, 1997). Thus, this paper aims to analyze contributing factors in internal 
and external sources that affect the attention of drivers in the Philippines. Design of Experiment (DOE) has been used 
to simulate a model for driving performance of subjects to determine the effect or impact of factors in internal and 
external sources to the attention of drivers. Contributing factors of internal sources that were considered in the study 
are tasks, age, gender, driving experience and type of license used by drivers while factors for external sources include 
pedestrian crossing, vehicle cuts-in, vehicle emergency brakes and vehicle counter flows.  On the other hand, 
measurements on the impact of driving performance that were considered in the study are change in speed, lane 
departure and collision count. Statistical analyses such as analysis of variance and Cramer’s V test were employed in 
the study to determine the relationship of contributing factors to the impact of driving performance. The results of the 
study showed that among the contributing factors in the internal sources, eating while driving has the highest impact 
on the driving performance of subjects while for external sources, all contributing factors have significant impact on 
the driving performance of subjects. Therefore, the result of the analysis will serve as the basis for the researchers to 
propose policies and regulations to help drivers avoid driving distractions and ensure road safety.

1. Introduction
Driving is one of the most complex activities done by many people daily. It is an attention-demanding task because 
attention must be allotted to all the surrounding vehicles, objects along the roadways, and objects that are found inside 
the vehicle. When a driver is distracted by other activities and/or events, driving errors can happen and safety is at 
threat (Ericson et al., 2016). This was validated in a study that driving under the influence of distraction can be a factor 
in road accidents (Rupp et al., 2017 and Talbot et al., 2012)  
Driver distraction is a type of driver inattention (NHTSA, 2016 and Regan et al., 2011) wherein it redirects the drivers’ 
concentration in driving to perform other activities that reduces their ability to fully control the vehicle. This happens 
when the driver diverts his attention because he is momentarily focused on an object, person, task, or event that is not 
related to driving such as texting and/or calling while driving (Caird et al., 2014), hands-free texting (TIRF, 2013) 
eating and drinking, smoking (Stutts et al., 2005), looking at paper map, watching videos, checking the news via 
internet access and putting on a make-up and/or grooming (Braitman et al., 2017).  
In previous studies, driver distraction has been classified to have two sources: internal and external (Talbot et al., 
2507","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Bangkok, 
Thailand, March 5-7, 2019

b. Forward Collision Warning (FCW) – Visual and/or audible warning intended alert the driver and 
prevent a collision.  
c. Blind Spot Warning (BSW) – Visual and/or audible notification of vehicle in blind spot. The system 
may provide an additional warning if you use your turn signal when there is a car next to you in another 
lane.  
d. Rear cross-traffic warning – Visual, audible or haptic notification of object or vehicle out of your camera 
range but could be into it.  
e. Lane-departure warning (LDW) – Visual, audible, or haptic warning to alert the driver when they are 
crossing lane markings.  
f. Lane-keeping assist (LKA) – Automatic corrective steering input or braking provided by the vehicle 
when crossing lane markings.  
g. Lane-centering assist – Continuous active steering to stay in between lanes (active steer, auto-steer, etc.)  
h. Adaptive cruise control – Adaptive cruise uses lasers, radar, cameras, or a combination of these systems 
to keep a constant distance between you and the car ahead, automatically maintaining a safe following 
distance. If highway traffic slows, some systems will bring the car to a complete stop and automatically 
come back to speed when traffic gets going again, allowing the driver to do little more than pay attention 
and steer.  
i. Rear automatic emergency braking (Rear AEB) – Brakes are automatically applied to prevent backing 
into something behind the vehicle. This could be triggered by the rear cross-traffic system, or other 
sensors on the vehicle.  
  
2. Cellular phones should have an automatic disable of phone use when driving. This is called Driving Mode. 
Thus, only latest phones and mobiles with the latest operating system has it. It should be a standard that all 
cellphones regardless of the operating system, should have a driving mode.  
  
3. Lawmakers should pass a legislation wherein vehicle drivers who engaged to counter flow, vehicle cut, and 
emergency braking should be penalized. Thus, it should be a requirement for all types of vehicle to install 
dash cam in order to provide concrete evidence of the act.  
  
4. Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) should only put pedestrian lanes near stoplights.   
  
5. Lawmakers should implement a policy that prohibits eating while driving. Currently, the passage of the Anti-
Distracted Driving Act in the Philippines is not as effective as it should be since most of the private vehicles 
have a window tint of 50%-75%, making it hard for enforcers to have a clear vision of the driver while 
driving. It should be stated that in order to have a clear view of what driver is doing inside, an allowable 
grade of 35% for car tint should be implied. Law violators should be penalized depending on how frequent 
the driver has violated the law.   
  
4. Conclusion  
  
Based on the result of the experiment, the following conclusions were drawn:  
(1) The result of initial survey revealed that subjects were exposed to different types of distractions while driving 
both from internal and external sources. From internal sources, majority of the respondents are exposed to 
distractions such as phone conversation, adjusting the radio, eating, drinking and talking to passenger. For 
external sources, respondents are exposed to distractions such as pedestrian crossing, vehicle cuts-in, vehicle 
emergency brakes, and vehicle counter flows.  
(2) The result of the analysis of variance proved that internal and external distractions that affect the driving 
performance of respondents in terms of change in speed, lane departure and collision count differs in terms 
of gender of drivers, years of driving experience and type of license use.   
(3) Cramer’s V test revealed that for internal sources of distraction, factor that has the highest effect of driving 
performance is eating, while for external sources, factors that affect driving performance are pedestrian 
crossing, vehicle cuts-in, sudden breaking and vehicle counter flow.

Abstract   
  
The study aims to investigate the causes of accidents among the food processing company in the Philippines by 
analyzing 82 cases of accident reports which could help in the development of preventive strategies and safety plans 
for companies in reducing the occurrence of workplace accidents. In order to perform an in-depth analysis of accidents, 
the researchers first categorized the factors associated with the accidents based gender, age, type of work, shift, extent 
of disability, accident type, body part affected, place of injury, nature of injury and other contributing factors. Then, 
statistical analysis such as Cramer’s V test were performed in order to determine the significant associations among 
factors considered in the study. Afterwards, task analysis using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is 
employed to determine the detailed task, percentage of responsibility and the failure points that led to the accidents. 
And finally, cause-responsibility analysis such as Occupational Accident Tree Analysis (OATA) and Occupational 
Accident Component Analysis (OACA) were used in order to determine the root causes of accidents and identify the 
percentage responsibility of worker and company towards the accident. The result of the analysis showed that place 
of injury and contributing factors were the most significant factors that led to the accident of workers. These findings 
helped the researchers in developing preventive strategies and safety plans for the companies to reduce occurrence of 
accidents in the future.

1. Introduction  
  
Workplace accident is defined as the occurrence of an unpredicted accident in the workplace during the course of 
employments that are caused by the hazards that are inherent in, or is related to it (Baktiyari et al., 2012). These 
accidents are caused by various workplace factors (Khanzode et al., 2012) that resulted in loss of production, illness 
or injury, or damage to equipment or property (Reese et al., 2006). According to the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) statistics, about 317 million accidents occur at work every year, which made workplace accident a public priority 
(Hajakbari, 2014). Many authors have investigated the importance of workplace accidents starting from different 
perspectives through multiple approaches (Beland et al., 1991) and addressed workplace accidents in different 
workplace groups (Mearns et al., 2000; Probst, 2002; Barling et al., 2003; Rundmo and Hale, 2003; Gyekye, 2005; 
Håvold, 2007; Håvold and Nesset, 2009). The objective of workplace accident research is to understand accidents by 
obtaining accurate and objective information about the causes of accident, so that these accidents can be reduced and 
preventive measures can be designed (Jacinto et al., 2008 and Dotchev et al., 2008). However, the creation and 
application of preventive measure depends on the type of industry and their corresponding activities.  
  
In the Philippines, data shows that within major industry group, the manufacturing industry occupies the top place and 
has the highest number of accidents with 23,641 (48.6% of the total) in 2013. More than one in five fatal accidents at 
work in the Philippines took place within the manufacturing sector, resulted to a highest percentage share compared 
to other sectors. Whilst, wholesale and retail trade sectors had a percentage increase of 11.8%, followed by 
accommodation and food service sectors with 51.85% and construction with 37.82%.

Similarly, the concept of a prevention culture is implicitly use to Case 2 and Case 3 also stated in table above based 
on the concept of a safety culture. The difference between prevention and safety culture is the latter aims to reduce 
work-related risks and mostly address workplace level that is found mainly in high-risk industries and emphasized on 
the protection of health, whereas the former emphasizes both the protection and promotion of health (Kim et al., 2016), 
and requires to reduce risks in the workplace level by promoting technological improvements, compliance with 
regulations and labor inspections, and introduction of an occupational safety and health management system, as well 
as managed culture change to achieve a positive safety culture. This also includes workers at all workplaces.  
  
4. Conclusion  
  
The study applied statistical analysis and cause-responsibility analysis on 82 cases of accidents in a food processing 
company to evaluate causes associated with all the factors given. A complete coding and classification was developed 
to analyze and coded each accident in terms of the victim’s age, gender, the type of worker, shift, place, type and 
nature of injury, body parts affected and contributing factors. Similar to the study of Chi et al., (2017), coding scheme 
was able to identify factors contributing to the accidents. Contributing factors such as insufficient/ inadequate 
illumination, exposure to chemical substances, deficiencies in personal protective equipment and poor housekeeping 
and cleaning mostly have damaging effects on the workplace accidents were associated with place and type of injury 
derived through analysis of Cramer’s V by applying multi-linear event sequencing method. With the support of the 
practical information and tools of Task Analysis, FMEA and Cause-Responsibility Analysis, identification of hazards, 
determination of accident causes, responsible groups and their role on accident as well as the responsibility rate (Jabarri 
et al., 2016) were determined to enhance safety of workers. As a result of using Cramer’s V as well as the CRA 
technique on the 82 cases the results confirmed that the study was well applicable to achieve the objectives of the 
research. For responsible groups involved, the analysis of this research can be useful as a way of adding relevant 
knowledge to the management of workplace safety (Carillo-Castrillo et al., 2013) and can be used among other risk 
assessment, preventive plan and safety measures in any food processing company. Future researches may be extended 
to assess the effectiveness of these tools by developing Probabilistic Risk Assessment and Fault Tree Analysis 
approach particularly on the analysis of accidents.

Abstract 
Lean Manufacturing is an approach to system efficiency by reducing waste. This approach is done by understanding the 
company's general picture through the flow of information and materials on the production floor by creating value stream 
mapping. Problems that occur is the discovery of delay time in the production flow due to value added time and non-
value added time. There is unbalanced causing increasing length of production lead time. The purpose of the research 
conducted to 1) Identify the value and non-value added time contained in the flow of production process 2) Conduct 
analysis of the VSM made and 3) Finding the root of the problem using the 5W + 1H method. VSM is made by 
collecting the data cycle time from the work station by the time watch study method. Current State Map show that there 
is a Value Added and Non-Value Added Time Time, which occurs in one cycle. Total Value Added Time was 328.8 
minutes, while the total Non-Value Added Time is 5.667 days. While the manufacture of Future State Map Total Value 
Added Time was 328.8 minutes, while Total Non-Value Added Time is 5.125 days.

1. Introduction
The development of the industrial world so rapidly causing increasingly fierce industry competition among industries 
primarily engaged in the same place. To win this competition the company is required to have a strategy for minimizing 
or eliminating waste throughout the production process flow continuously (Apel,Azizi,Chapel). The process flow is a 
sequence of jobs or activities involved in producing goods and services. Improving the production process, satisfying 
customers and achieving high productivity has a target company. 
Throughout the production process flow are activities that provide added value (value added) and non-value-added (non 
value added). Non-value added activities this always result in waste. In an effort to minimize the process that do not add 
value (non-value added) for firms required an improvement in the flow of the production process and the flow of 
information through the creation of Value Stream Mapping (Feld,Nowak). Various studies use VSM as a tool. Many 
research topics are applied using VSM such as VSM quality, energy VSM, sustainable VSM, etc. Various studies use 
USM as a tool to minimize processes that do not add value to the company. VSM such as VSM quality, VSM Energy, 
VSM Sustainable, etc. are often applied in various research topics. For example, process industries, automobile 
industries, electrical manufacturing services and others using VSM as the tool (Rother,Wilson,Yusof). 
Currently a manufacture company especially as a producer of CPO (Crude Palm Oil) and palm kernel still found their 
value-added activity (non-value adding activity) or waste in the production process such delay as a result of the 
accumulation in the threshing. Buildup that occurs as a result of differences in the production capacity of each process 
and processing times are not balanced on threshing station. These activities ultimately lead to increased production of 
long lead times. The consumption of electrical energy and water usage from year to year increase was also a factor why 
companies should look at the waste that occurs through the manufacture of Value Stream Mapping (Edtmayr,Meudt). 
Based on this problem, it is necessary to do this research related to Value Stream Mapping and any factors that cause 
waste throughout the production process flow. It analyzed in depth entire activities through the main flows, starting from 
raw material and ending with final process in shop floor (Verma).

Abstract 
The aim of this research is to study the feasibility of reducing cost of forklift's tire replacement. According to the 
gathering data, the new tire replacement cost from January to June 2018 is 617,280 THB which seems very high. 
In order to reduce this cost, the VA/VE technique is chosen to analyze the data due to its accomplishment in an 
automotive industry. A comparison between the new OEMs tire and retreading tire in 1,000 working hours has 
been analyzed based on this concept. Its implementation and details of a feasibility ranking table are clearly 
demonstrated and discussed. The results shown that the replacement cost of the retreading tires are only 288,560 
THB which is lower than the new OEM tire by 53.25%.

In the era of industry 4.0, banking activities has embedded in society’s daily life. Industry 4.0 drives 
conventional bank become digital bank.  Unfortunarely, only 36% of Indonesia’s population is connected to formal 
financial institutions, and this condition leaves 64% of population in Indonesia is unbanked. Bank Mandiri as leading 
bank in Indonesia constructed “2018 Digital Banking Strategy” to penetrate the market. Unfortunately, the growth of 
Indonesia’s economy and increasing internet user are not in line with growth of Bank Mandiri E-channel user growth. 
This research aimed to to analyze factors that influence banking market in East Java and provide 
recommendation for Bank Mandiri East Java Region with their Electronic banking service sales strategy using data 
analytics approach.  
Several methods are involved in this research. Started with data and information collection from Bank 
Mandiri East Java Region, data analytics process by considering banking performance and economic condition by 
using factor analysis. Recommendation of sales strategy is by using multiple regression analysis to analyze sales 
enablers. 
Output of this reserach will be a marketing and sales recommendation for Bank Mandiri for their banking area in 
East Java.

number of ATMs, and Number of Branches. Contribution of Factor number 1 for Bank Mandiri potential market is 
18.546. 
 
4.3 Multiple Regression Analysis  
 
Multiple Regression Analysis consist of dependent variable (Y) and independent variable (X). In this research, 
the dependent variable is Fee-Based Income (FBI) of Bank Mandiri East Java Region, and independent variable consist 
of number of registered user, number of transaction, and total funding of East Java customer. Confidence level is 95%, 
and P-value must not above 0.05. P-value with value more than 0.05 is eliminated. Number of registered user shows 
P-value of 0.7 and number of transaction shows P-value of 0.6, thus these variables must be eliminated.  
 
 
Figure 5 Multiple Regression Analysis from Excel Data Analysis 
From the output of regression of Transaction Frequency and FBI, the adjusted R square is maintained is 90%, 
indicates that the dependent variable (FBI) is 90% influenced by the independent variable (funding). The P-value of 
funding does not exceed the maximum value (0.05) thus indicates that predictor’s value is related to changes in the 
response variable. From the summary output, the regression formula of FBI (Y) is shown below. 
 
Y (FBI) =  122.499.205 + FUNDING *(0.000071)+....BnXn  
 
 
 
With the regression formula, the FBI can be calculated by inputing value of funding (X) in the formula. The 
Y (FBI) is obtained by adding 11.150.737 as constant to the calculation result of 0.000071 coefficient of funding) 
times desired amount of funding. 
 
5. Conclusions and Implications of Research Findings 
 
The finding of this research indicated that Electricity and Gas, Water Supply, Construction, Wholesale and 
Retail trade, Transportation and Storage, Accomodation and Food service Activities, Information and Communication, 
Financial and Insurance Activities, Real Estate Activities, Business Activities, Other Service Activities industries are 
dominant variables that dominate banking market and should become priority industry for Bank Mandiri to market 
their Electronic Banking services. Banking aspects such as number of ATMs and number of branches of Bank Mandiri 
also become priority variable to support the market penetration.  
Bank Mandiri East Java region must conduct a program to increase their amount of funding. Increase in 
amount of funding influence 90% for the increase of Fee-based Income of Bank Mandiri East Java Region.

Abstract 
Activities in supply chain may affect the environment and changes environmental performance. Thus, audit supply 
chains is needed based on environmental sustainability. One of the most effective things to improve environmental 
sustainability is integrating traditional supply chain practices into an environmental friendly concept. Efforts to 
improve the performance of the company's traditional supply chain into an environmental friendly supply chain 
requires obtaining the company's supply chain performance to reach the export requirements and improve the produced 
quality by the company. In an effort to improve traditional supply chain performance into an environmental friendly 
supply chain, the Analytic Network Process (ANP) used as a performance measurement method that takes into account 
interrelationships between objective strategies one another in achieving the intended goals according to the provisions 
of the analysis that is processed, there are 4 criterias and 16 most dominant indicators that can improve the quality of 
shrimp feed companies. The percentage of weighting results on the four performance criteria are the criteria for green 
manufacturing with a weight of 33.2 percent, followed by the criteria for green procurement of 27.3 percent, green 
distribution of 23.4 percent and the lowest weight is the reverse logistic criterion of 15.9 percent.

1. Introduction
Environmental damage and global warming have encouraged the public to focus on continuous improvement of 
environmental problems [1]. Continuous protection and improvement of environmental issues have attracted global 
attention in the past two decades. Many companies and governments in various countries have begun to realize the 
importance of environmentally friendly supply chains [2]. Although company regulations on the environment have 
not been too serious to consider, the issue of ""green"" is a new thing that always develops every day and requires 
continuous research in the field to get a complete understanding of environmental problems [3]. 
There are four main components for environmentally friendly practices namely analyzing life cycle, environmentally 
friendly quality management, ISO 1400 certification for environmentally friendly supply chains and ISO 1400 
certification for environmentally friendly designs [4]. In today's competitive market, the scope of environmental 
activities exceeds the limitations of the company and involves the entire supply chain from the supply of raw materials 
for product use and further to reverse logistics processes including product recycling [5]. Supply chains involve 
activities that can affect the natural environment and also produce changes in environmental performance. So this is 
why there is a need to audit supply chains based on environmental sustainability. Every organization must know the 
status and purpose of developing or enhancing an environmentally friendly supply chain [6]. One of the best and most 
effective ways to improve environmental sustainability by integrating traditional supply chain practices with 
environmental friendliness in the concept of ""green supply chain"" [7].

4. Conclusion 
Based on the results of data processing and analysis that have been carried out, some conclusions can be drawn as 
follows: 
1. Measurement of the performance of the green supply chain at PT. X which influences efforts to improve the quality 
of shrimp feed through improving the performance of traditional supply chains into green supply chains using 4 
criteria, namely green procurement, green manufacturing, green distribution and reverse logistics. 
2. The most dominant criteria that influence efforts to improve the quality of shrimp feed through improving the 
performance of traditional supply chains to become a green supply chain by companies based on the ANP method 
are the criteria for green manufacturing (0.3324), followed by the criteria of green procurement (0.2732), green 
distribution (0.2347) and the lowest weight is the reverse logistic criterion (0.1597). 
3. Things that can improve the quality of shrimp feed in accordance with export requirements for performance 
improvement can be done with environmentally friendly manufacturing activities (green manufacturing). 
4. Green Manufacturing is the main criterion with the highest percentage of 33.24% by controlling the use of 
chemicals that influence technology on energy use efficiency, green competencies that is training in understanding 
and capability of human resources in green production and on waste utilization and pollution reduction on the 
company. 
5. Green procurement becomes the second criterion with a percentage of 27.32% by selecting a green supplier that 
implements ISO standards, paying attention to the efficiency of the use of raw materials, using products that can 
be recycled and improving the ability of human resources in managing the procurement of friendly raw materials 
environment in the company. 
6. Green distribution becomes the third criterion with a percentage of 23.47% by doing and improving the use of 
environmentally friendly packaging for the company. 
7. Reverse Logistics becomes the fourth criterion with a percentage of 15.97% by doing and improving the process 
of grouping the level of product redistribution to the company.

Abstract 
Demand uncertainties give challenges in transportation service procurement. Many companies only using 
long-term contract carrier which does not provide flexibility under the instability of transportation demand. 
This research aims to understand the behavior of transportation planning using two transportation sources 
namely contract and spot market carrier in terms of product availability in the market and the transportation 
cost. The contract carrier refers to the long-term agreement between a shipper and a carrier while a shipper 
is also available to purchase their transportation in the spot market in order to satisfy the excess demand. 
The simulation study is developed to capture the behavior of the system subject to the uncertainty of the 
demand, distribution process, and the complexity of the system. The results show that the utilization of spot 
carrier increases the availability of the product in the market, yet it also increases the total transportation 
cost and reduces the utilization of the trucks.  
Keywords 
Long-term contract, spot market, Transportation sourcing, Simulation study, and Supply chain management. 
1. Introduction
Uncertainties occur in many aspects in the supply chain including the distribution process. Peidro et al. (2009) 
mentioned that uncertainty is the difference between the required number of information to perform the process and 
the available information. The demand from the customers is hard to predict. Moreover, the traffic and congestion 
results in the delay, long queuing in the process, and instability of the travel time. Thus, it may result in a lack of 
transportation supply. The cost implication of having a delay in the process includes a cost to reschedule, loss of sales, 
and excess or insufficient inventory. One of the methods to overcome uncertainties is by enabling a flexibility 
(Angkiriwang et al., 2014). The flexibility in the distribution process can be in the form of a flexible schedule, flexible 
capacity, and flexible route (Song and Dong, 2011). There are still few studies addressing the flexible sourcing of 
transportation.  
The development of third-party logistics changes the perspective of having their fleets to outsourcing all of the 
transportation, because it is believed to give more benefit to the company (Alp et al., 2003). Many shippers are 
reserving a certain capacity for their shipment using a long-term contract to obtain a negotiable fare for the delivery 
(Qin et al., 2012) and to maintain a close relationship between a buyer and a supplier (Serel et al., 2001). Nevertheless, 
in the capacity commitment, the shipper does not have the flexibility to increase the capacity of their contract in 
accordance with the unexpected increase of the demand. Re-arrangement of the contract involves complicated and 
long negotiation processes. Thus, the contract itself does not guarantee that the shipper is able to satisfy all the demand. 
Tibben‐Lembke and Rogers (2006) predict that in the future, logistics will have media for exchanging the information 
to facilitate the shipper and buyer to buy or sell their logistics services. This opens new options for the logistics 
sourcing strategy. 
In this paper, we analyze the performance of the shipper by combining two sources of transportation which are 
purchased from a long-term contract and from a spot market. Our work considers a big manufacturing company in

The total cost reflects the sum of the cost for each type of carrier. The more dedicated number of contract carrier 
results in higher cost. Moreover, if we allow a few numbers of the spot carrier into the system, the total cost in slightly 
increase. The escalation of the total cost becomes much higher if companies procure more transportation from the spot 
market.  
The results suggest that the additional allowance of the spot carrier to the system can increase the product availability 
in the retailers and also increase the total cost respectively. The higher number of trucks used results in the lower 
utilization of the dedicated carrier. Thus, the optimum strategy is difficult to obtain because there are tradeoffs among 
the parameters unless we develop a standard of the system.

In this study, we model the delivery system involving one vendor and multi retailers. We solved the transportation 
planning strategy involving two types of carrier which are procured from long-term contract agreement and from the 
spot market. The procurement of dedicated capacity only does not guarantee the accomplishment of the demand. The 
using of additional carriers is undeniable due to the uncertainty of transportation demand. The spot carrier is useful 
when there is an excess transportation demand which can increase the service level of the shipper. Nevertheless, a 
higher number of trucks procured from spot market also increase the cost of transportation. The shipper needs to 
determine their goals in order to have high product availability with low cost of transportation. 
This study can be extended in various ways. The development of transportation demand leads to an increase in travel 
congestion (Ha et al. 2018). Thus, the evaluation of transportation sourcing should accommodate the different results 
in the reliability of the system. The different performances of the spot carrier have not been accommodated. In practice, 
the selection of carrier from spot market requires the decision in several carrier’s attributes that need to be aligned 
with the goals of the shipper.

Abstract 
Price based emission reduction instruments are deemed to be effective in achieving emission reductions, as they induce 
emission reductions through price signals, and also generate revenues which can later be used. Among all, carbon tax 
systems and emission trading schemes are identified as the most popular pricing instruments. The success of a carbon 
pricing instrument heavily depends on the way the firms respond to it after the implementation. However, a study 
conducted on assessing the response of firms is not done. Hence, this research was aimed at evaluating the response 
of firms to carbon pricing instruments in Sri Lankan apparel sector. Initially, a comprehensive literature review was 
carried out from which a conceptual framework was developed, indicating how carbon pricing policy instruments are 
derived from principles of environmental economics and five decision alternatives available for firms in response to 
carbon pricing instruments. From the expert interviews it was found that the above decision is influenced by three 
decision criteria, which indicated analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as the best method to identify the response of 
firms. Hence, as a part of this study, hierarchical structure of AHP was developed using the findings of literature 
review and expert interviews.

1. Introduction
In order to address the issue of climate change and global warming, countries have reached agreements over 
individual and collective commitments to reduce harmful emissions. Initiation of United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ensured international agreements, which were directly focused 
on Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction (Schipper 2006). Advent of the international agreements have 
alarmed countries to look for methods of achieving emission reductions. Many countries have adopted various 
emission reduction policy instruments for many years without much success. In the earlier stages, direct 
command and control mechanisms such as emission cap and energy efficiency mandates were given more 
emphasis (Parry and Williams 1999). However, with the below par results, the attention expanded to incentive 
based approaches which impose a price on carbon emissions (Goulder and Parry 2008). 
According to Cong and Lo (2017), during the past ten years, the countries have inclined more towards price-
based climate policy instruments. Moreover, carbon tax system and emission trading system (ETS) are 
considered as the two most common carbon pricing instruments (Goulder and Parry 2008). Carbon pricing 
instruments focus on internalizing external environmental costs in to the production cost (Lin and Li 2011). 
According to Andrew and Kaidonis (2011), this additional environmental cost is expected to induce 
behavioural changes in firms to minimize carbon emissions. Both ex-post evaluations in the implemented 
countries and ex-ante simulations provide evidences for effectiveness of carbon pricing instruments in 
achieving emission reductions (Wang et al. 2016). Despite the availability of scientific evidence to prove the 
effectiveness, implementation of carbon pricing instruments is not widely popular among developing 
countries. 
This paper presents a conceptual framework to evaluate the response of firms to carbon pricing instruments 
in Sri Lanka. The conceptual framework indicates how principles of environmental economics and

available decision alternatives and the applicable decision making criteria, the hierarchical structure for 
overall objective of “response of firms to carbon pricing instruments” was developed.

Abstract 
Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is a technique for critical analysis and radical redesign of prevailing business 
processes to obtain improvements in performance measures. Though BPR projects seem promising and offer many 
benefits to organisations, researchers have found that typically around seventy percent of reengineering projects fail 
in action due to various issues.  Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify the issues which may have significant 
impacts on the successful implementation of BPR projects. Four case studies were conducted to identify the issues 
faced during actual BPR project implementation. Thirty (30) unique issues faced by the organisations in different 
phases of the reengineering process (i.e. Pre-BPR implementation phase, BPR implementation phase and Post-BPR 
implementation phase) were identified. It is hoped that the findings of this study could facilitate the practitioners in 
identifying the issues in implementing BPR projects that should be given enough consideration to assure the success 
of BPR projects.

1. Introduction
Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is a management technique for transforming organisations in a radical manner 
in order to bring about significant enhancements (Hammer 1990; Hammer and Champy 1993). Simply, BPR is defined 
as the fundamental and radical approaches undertaken to enhance the underlying process efﬁciency through altering 
or rejecting non-value adding activities and redeveloping the process (McNulty and Ferlie 2000). Since BPR 
contributes to reduce the cost of activities via the analysis and redesign of the workflow and processes of the 
organisation, in the current competitive market, it is considered as an effective managerial tool to cope with 
technological and marketing changes (Omidi and Khoshttinat 2016).  
In many instances, the complicated changes brought by BPR projects in all aspects of people, processes, and 
technologies, have resulted in many issues throughout the BPR implementation process (Al-Mashari and Zairi 2000a), 
which has ultimately led to project failures (Champy 1995; Tennant and Wu 2005). Consequently, there is a vital need 
to pay sufficient attention towards issues in implementation to ensure the success of BPR projects (Champy 1995).  
Hence, the aim of this paper is to explore the issues which may have significant impacts on the success of BPR 
projects.  
2. Issues in Implementing BPR Projects
The high failure rate of BPR projects has highlighted the importance of identifying and addressing issues in BPR 
implementation (Champy 1995; Darmani and Hanafizadeh 2013; Padhi et al. 2014). A number of researchers have 
identified some key issues associated with BPR implementation (Al-Mashari and Zairi 2000b; Grover et al. 1995; 
Martin and Cheung 2000; Zhao 2004). Among which only Grover et al. (1995) has put forward a list of sixty-four 
(64) BPR implementation issues classified under six categories by compiling the findings of various researches. Table
1 portrays the potential issues in BPR implementation as put forward by Grover et al. (1995).

5. Conclusions  
 
Though BPR is considered as a key technique to alter the business processes within organisations to attain greater 
improvements in business performance, around seventy percent of BPR projects have resulted in failure (Dennis et al. 
2003; Hammer and Champy 1993; Malhotra 1998; Nauman Habib 2013). This high failure rate of BPR efforts has 
raised the need for identifying issues in implementing BPR projects which may have substantial impact on BPR project 
success. 
 
Through four (04) case studies, altogether thirty (30) issues faced by the Sri Lankan organisations in implementing 
BPR projects were identified under three phases (i.e. Pre-BPR implementation phase, BPR implementation phase, and 
Post-BPR implementation phase). ‘Lack of top management commitment and support’ was the key issue identified in 
Pre-BPR implementation phase, while ‘resistance to change’ and ‘project participants’ conflict between team 
responsibilities and functional responsibilities’ were the key issues faced in BPR implementation phase. On the other 
hand, ‘difficulty in measuring reengineering project performance’ was identified as the key issue faced in Post-BPR 
implementation phase.  
 
The findings of this study are useful for the practitioners in identifying the issues in implementing BPR projects that 
should be given enough consideration to assure the success of BPR projects. This research has opened up the 
opportunity for some new research directions, which could be done in the future. Since, in the existing literature there 
is no practical framework to guide the organisations in successfully reengineering their BPR projects, developing a 
framework for the successful implementation of BPR projects can be considered as a vital future research area.

Abstract 
The purpose of this research was to assess the applicability of integrating Building Information Modelling for 
sustainable and green buildings in Sri Lankan context. A comprehensive literature survey was conducted first to review 
the existing knowledge on BIM integration to green buildings, Green BIM techniques used and data requirements for 
the use of Green BIM. Subsequently, a single case study was carried out to practically apply the Green BIM 
technology. The selection of the case was based upon the availability of data required to use BIM integrated sustainable 
techniques. Thus, the data availability was analyzed first through a questionnaire survey including the data identified 
from literature. Based on the findings of questionnaire survey, an existing green building was selected for the case 
study. A framework was developed including the steps to be followed for the use of Green BIM for selected green 
building. The research findings revealed that, though BIM was not well established technology in Sri Lankan 
construction industry, there is a potential for the use of Green BIM in existing green buildings, if the required data are 
adequately and accurately available.

1. Introduction
Increasingly, the need of green technology has come to the forefront in both developed and developing 
countries. (Bhattarai et al. 2013). Because of the higher environmental performance, green building 
construction has recently become a new trend in Sri Lanka as well (Waidyasekara and Fernanado 2013). 
Meanwhile, as a response for the massive energy consumption, number of subsequent technologies were 
evolved in the field of construction, which facilitate the achievement of sustainable outcomes.  
In light of this, Green BIM as one of such modern technologies, has extensively been discussed in the field 
of research to be integrated with sustainable outcomes of buildings. Green BIM is considered as the use of 
BIM tools, to enhance the building performance and to achieve the sustainability objectives of a project 
(Krygiel and Nies 2008).  Green BIM has significantly been appreciated in construction industry and thus, 
building owners have focused to integrate BIM with sustainable design strategies (Wong and Fan 2013). 
Green BIM offers various comprehensive building performance analysis in terms of energy, water, lighting, 
sustainable materials and life cycle cost analysis, which are important to evaluate the overall energy 
performance of buildings that leads to reduce the energy consumption (Wong and Zhou 2015).  
However, when considering the Sri Lankan context, since BIM is not yet established, the need of using Green 
BIM technology is still unknown. Thus, this research was focused to assess the potential of Green BIM 
implementation for the existing green buildings in Sri Lanka. The scope of research was limited for the 
existing green buildings due to the practical barriers of conducting Green BIM for green building projects 
during design and construction phases.

As presented in the table, there are slight differences between the simulated value and actual value. The reasons for 
the differences basically depends on the simulating method used in the software. It considers weather condition and 
data, geographical location of the building and building orientation in order to determine the impact of solar radiation 
to the building. However, this comparison was limited for several parameters as all simulation results given from 
Green BIM software cannot be manually calculated or taken. Due to the ability of Green BIM software to provide 
comprehensive energy simulation and performance results, Green BIM simulation results are more reliable and 
important for energy management of buildings. Comprehensive Green BIM simulations can be used to evaluate the 
energy performance of buildings. As this study focused to assess the ability of using Green BIM, it can be concluded 
that, it is possible to generate Green BIM simulation results to enhance the energy performance of existing buildings. 
To facilitate the research aim, this study focused on a single case study and come up with a conclusion that since the 
data are available in existing green buildings, there is a potential to use Green BIM technology for the existing green 
buildings in Sri Lanka, even though BIM has not been implemented during the early stages.  
5. Conclusions 
According to the aforementioned findings, though the data availability appears to be numerically satisfactory, there 
could be issues due to the lack of accuracy and reliability of data, which are hidden and invisible until practical 
implementation is initiated. Hence, even though the data are available apparently, a proper examination should be 
carried out in order to realize the accuracy and actual availability of data up to the accepted level. However, as this 
study was able to conduct energy analysis of Green BIM, it can be concluded that, there is a possibility of using Green 
BIM techniques for existing green buildings in Sri Lanka. However, further studies need to be undertaken to identify 
and evaluate this applicability when the level of data availability is different in green buildings.

Abstract 
The consumer behaviour has forced many organizations to progress from traditional ways of doing things. Lean 
principles has recently assumed a very important position in consideration of procedures that can increase efficiency 
and effectiveness in a number of operating divisions in organizations. Courier service companies seem to have been 
left behind in embracing the transformational effects of lean principles, as majority of them are still operating, and 
based on traditional routine method of servicing clients. This has to change in order to confront the rapidly changing 
and increasingly competitive nature of modern courier service demands. Applications like Uber, for example; have 
created a disruption within the market, while responding to the consumer behaviour, of wanting things easier, and 
wanting them now. The paper examines application of lean principles in the manufacturing, production, services and 
allied sectors. The absence of research output on courier service sectors is conspicuous in literature. A methodological 
improvement on how lean principle can be applied in courier service sector is presented. The principle is capable of 
upgrading the sector in a manner that can respond to the e-commerce market, with better improved processes and 
better pay-back.

required can be the basis of research in courrier service. There has to be a debate on whether a courier company require 
a huge warehouse, whereas their service is to deliver within a certain period, which should ultimately resolve their 
inventory nightmare. There are organisations which are still building massive warehouse, which offer variety of 
service (Anonymous 2, 2018), however, there is a need to investigate whether courier organisations, should follow 
suit. This will also assist on how the courier sectors should respond to the ecommerce market, which is growing rapidly 
world wide (Anonymous 3, 2018) and courier playing one of the critical part in ensuring that things are delivered 
within the expected time, it has become vital for the implementation of Lean principles which will be responding to 
the pull system used by ecommerce platform.  
 
Conclusion 
 
The above illustrates that there is a need for further research on building a relationship between Lean principles and 
transportation industry, especially on the courier sector, which plays a key role within the ecommerce platform. This 
will ensure that, organsiation seize the opportunity of growing, by responding to the market demand in a well 
structured, cost effective way, applying world-class principles.

Abstract 
The increase in population and users of motorized vehicles is increasing in Indonesia. One of the increasing 
numbers of toll road users. The toll road payment system has varied. The problem is the use of a ticket 
system that can lead to congestion queues. The development of the current payment system is the use of 
the toll card system. The toll card cannot perfectly overcome congestion at the toll gate. On the Menanggal 
toll gate is the main entrance with 2 types of toll booths (GTO and Hybrid). It can be said that there are 
quite a lot of vehicles that run daily at the gate and not infrequently there is a long queue density during 
office hours and during work breaks. This study aims to compare GTO and Hybrid systems. The 
methodology used was using the Indonesian road capacity manual MKJI 1997. The conclusion of this study 
was that the rate of arrival that occurred on each shift was shift 1, the level of vehicles coming was 1083 
pcs / hour, shift 2, 1308 pcs / hour. For Shift 3, 209 pcs / hour. Next is the number of vehicles that pass per 
second. In each second time, it is divided by 6 substations, 3 HYBRID substations and 3 automatic toll 
booths (GTO). But for shift 3 there is a difference because the substations that operate are only 4 substations, 
which consist of 1 HYBRID substation and 3 automatic toll booths (GTO). So it can be concluded that the 
capacity of the abandoning Menanggal is still safe. The difference in the efficiency of transaction time on 
GTO and HYBRID is 1; 1.5 of these results are obtained from the number of vehicles passing between the 
2 types of substations.

Abstract 
Around a billion new tires are generated every year around the world as a result of the global growth of 
the tire industry, but only a small percentage are reused as in closed-loop supply systems. The mining 
industry is one of the world’s massive scrap off-the-road (OTR) tire generators considering their 
uninterrupted high-scale activity fueling faster OTR tire life cycles. The handling of massive OTR tires 
discarded from the mining industry represents an economic, environmental and social challenge. As a 
solution to this problem, reverse logistics plays an important role enabling the cost-effective management 
of residual items while affecting the service and product recovery value, adequate final disposition and 
the development of environmentally friendly practices. This research proposes a solution approach to the 
problem of the reverse logistics network for residual OTR tires from the mining industry, illustrating with 
a Colombian case study. An optimization model is proposed to determine the final OTR tires disposition 
at a minimum cost. Results showed that opening a power generation plant might be a potentially cost-
effective solution that could help mines to comply with the country’s regulations and turn this waste into 
a positive value good.

Introduction
The tire industry is a global and growing industry, in which around a billion new tires are generated every year
around the world (Kumar & Saravanan, 2014), with only a small percentage of these being properly disposed for
reuse in closed-loop supply systems. This research develops in the context of the mining industry, a significant
market segment for the tire industry, but even more significant with regards to the share of scrap tires by weight that
is generated as an externality of the mining operations (Sheerin, 2017). In the world, the handling of massive OTR
(Off the Road) tires discarded from the mining activity, oftentimes simply disposed as a whole and piled up near the
operation, has represented an economic, environmental and social challenge.
As for the economical adversities advised, are due to the logistical difficulties in transporting OTR tires from remote 
places to any given location due to its huge dimensions: the diameters of these tires oscillate between 2 and 3 
meters, but they can reach up to 4 meters with weights of more than 3 tons (Goodyear, 2017). Downsizing these tires 
as an initial step for reusing and/or recycling also poses both significant technical and economic challenges, due to 
its gigantic dimensions that requires important investments in heavy duty large-sized shears for tires to be chopped 
up into pieces small enough to fit into a large shredder and then into mechanical grinding pulverization systems. 
Most usual ecology conversion alternatives into by-products start from tire triturate, directly used as raw materials in 
road construction, parks and sports surfaces (Ferrão, Ribeiro & Silva, 2008). Tire triturate is as well input of a 
variety of energy recovering techniques used as fuels (Amari, Themelis & Wernick, 1999; Jang, Yoo, Oh & Iwasaki, 
1998) and incineration processes available including dedicated incineration, incineration in utility and industrial 
boilers, incineration in cement kilns and pyrolysis (Galvagno, Casu, Casabianca, Calabrese, & Cornacchia, 2002).  
As cited in Evans (1997), scrap tire accumulation can also potentially create adverse environmental effects and 
threats to public health and safety. Problems associated with scrap tires include solid waste management in landfills

model, the total logistic cost was minimized and the analysis showed that a considerable investment shall be made in 
order to offset the high fixed costs and to accomplish the implementation of the reverse logistics network. The 
generating plant variable costs and the shredder set-up costs were also considered and found to be relatively low in 
comparison to the other costs mentioned earlier. Because of the already high initial investment, the scope of this 
work only considers the incorporation of a single (1) set of shredders, which must be shared and sequenced between 
mines. It does not incorporate, as well, the flow of smaller tires coming from the surrounding cities. This should be 
taken into account for future research, given that urban settings exhibit a similar problem as to the one from the 
mining industry. Nevertheless, the urban issue is expected to require less investment for the implementation of the 
solution, given that the dimensions of urban tires are relatively easy to handle, but a greater deal in transport due to 
the sparsity of locations and lesser amount of cargo.

Abstract 
Indonesian palm oil industry will have high competitiveness if there is a balance and sustainability of the industrial 
structure between the upstream-midstream-downstream will be achieved because the maximum added value and 
stability of the industry.  Existing conditions of the use of technology, policy evaluation and technology utilization 
program in the processed oil palm industry needs to be mapped in order to increase the competitiveness and 
sustainability of the Indonesian oil palm industry. The purpose of this study is to support the improvement of the 
competitiveness and sustainability of the palm oil industry in Indonesia through the use of mapping technology on a 
national palm oil industry, especially in upstream and midstream industry.  Primary data is obtained from the result of 
field survey through interviews, observations, questionnaires and Focus Group Discussions (FGD). While secondary 
data is obtained from relevant institutions at the Central, Provincial and Regency/Municipality levels.  Gaps 
technology used on the Indonesia palm oil industry today, compared with ideal conditions that have developed in the 
industry done. Gap analysis was carried out to the five standard benchmarks namely processing technology, energy, 
environment, human resources, financing, and research. Results of the analysis shows that the type of technology used 
is still dominant with 'semi- mechanical technology'.  In order to develop the use of technology in the palm oil industry 
will require improvements in aspects of Technology and Environmental Management System, Product Development 
and Technology Cooking Oils (Indonesian Branded). Some of the action plan is to be implemented include continuous 
sterilizer, gasification, methane capture, recovery tanks, recovery β-carotene, ISPO Implementation, vitamin A 
fortification, mandatory SNI for cooking oils and Indonesian Branding.

1. Introduction
Indonesia’s being the largest producer of palm oil (crude palm oil) has puts the palm oil industrial sector as the
leading national flagship, priority, and strategic sector. In the future, the palm oil will be able to become Indonesia’s 
flagship commodity, on accounts of (a) its deep industrial structure, (b) Indonesia's supportive natural resources, (c) 
abundant human resources, and (d) human resource’s competitive productivity. The national palm oil industry will be 
highly competitive if the balance and sustainability of the industrial structure in the upstream-downstream sectors are 
achieved. Building such an industry, Indonesia will attain a maximum added value and industrial stability.

The aspect of resource use in the palm oil industry in question is the balance of the use of water (water balance). 
When evaluated in the manufacturing industry, the use of water looks normal and balanced, but when it involves the 
calculation of water capture of palm trees, the resource use becomes unbalanced and wasteful. 
The environmental management system had already been met by several downstream industries, while upstream 
and midstream industries implement it as part of ISPO or RSPO requirements. All in all, environmental aspects are 
more emphasized in the upstream palm oil industry in Indonesia. 
 
3.4.4 Analysis on the Utilization of Technology in Labor Management  
The use of technology in labor management and labor involvement in the use of technology are important aspects 
to be evaluated. The availability of technology cannot be separated from the role of labors. Technology transfer 
appears to have run so well in the palm oil industry, where in overall industries surveyed, almost all technologies are 
operated by the Indonesian workers. 
 
3.4.5 Analysis on the Utilization of Technology in Cost Management 
The use of technology in managing costs was conducted to study the extent to which the use of technology in the 
palm oil industry affect the financing. The evaluation is associated with the cost structure of production, profitability, 
and the policy of selling price. The evaluation results are presented in Table 8. 
 
3.4.6 Analysis on the Utilization of Technology in Research Management 
The use of technology in the management of research was conducted to study business resilience and the 
sustainability of the palm oil industry. Indonesian oil companies generally have had internal research institutes, where 
research, especially in the downstream industries has been intensified. While research institutes or divisions in the 
upstream and midstream industries have not conducted research  on product development intensively although 
institutes or divisions are already formed. The upstream industries conducted more research on increasing the yield 
with a focus on raw materials. 
Palm oil industry in Indonesia conduct less research on process technology, where the overall processing 
technology is ""given"" by the machine manufacturing countries. This is not surprising due to the fact that the 
technological development of industrial machinery is slow in Indonesia. A similar phenomenon also occurs in almost 
all industries in Indonesia. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Palm oil upstream industry which has grown in Indonesia is currently the industry's crude palm oils (CPO), palm 
kernel oils (PKO), and palm kernel expeller as raw fodder.  Palm oil waste processing industry such as old trunks, 
bunches of empty shells, and have not grown commercially.  Almost all group companies have a PKO factory 
processing seeds of palm kernel oil becomes.  Generally the PKO factory built to absorb the oil from the nuclei of 
several other mills in the group.  Manufacturer of PKO will generally utilize by-product called Palm Kernel Expeller 
(TCE) as a raw material for animal feed.   
The logging industry survey amongst (mid stream) palm oil is done on cooking oil industry.  According to the 
characteristics of its industrial products, cooking oil and stearin derivative dominant island of Java.  Cooking oil 
industries in the region Sumatran mostly do the delivery in the form of bulk (bulk) and not do the packaging for 
consumer pack.  Industry who do packaging for consumer pack would add vitamin A fortification of stages and 
generally add more filters to filter the oil before it is packaged. 
The position of the utilization of technology in the upstream industry oil palm in Indonesia compared with the 
development of palm oil processing technologies that are available today are at a High level, while in the industry 
between palm oil are at the level of the Medium.  The results of research to successfully map the standard utilization 
of technology in the industry of processed between upstream and midstream palm oil processing.  The results of the 
gap analysis shows the largest gap the utilization of technology found on the aspects of the management of research 
development, environmental management, and energy management.

Abstract 
Assessment of employee performance is important in improving company performance. Performance appraisal takes 
into account factors that support employee performance in accordance with the aspects reviewed. Usually 
performance appraisals are carried out only by direct supervisors. The existence of differences in the results of the 
assessment of superiors with perceived employee perceptions, often results in employee dissatisfaction. Performance 
appraisal will be better if it involves more than one assessor. A 360 degree feedback method is a method of 
assessment by involving superiors, peers, and self assessment. Integration of 360-degree feedback methods and 
analytical hierarchy process (AHP) are used to improve assessment results. The application of this method was 
carried out on nurses in the care ward of one mental hospital, involving 52 people, consisting of 12 superiors and 40 
employees. The results show that the priority factors that influence nurse performances are work competency 
factors. There is a difference in the value of the gap between the assessment of superiors and employee ratings. The 
method integration has proven to have reduced the assessment gap level, so that the assessment results will be better.

1. Introduction
In a company context, employee performance is defined as employee contributions in achieving company goals. 
Employee performance appraisal is defined as a process to identify, evaluate, and develop employee performance 
within the company, so that the goals and objectives of the company can be effectively achieved. At the same time, 
employee performance measurement also benefits employees in terms of recognition, receiving feedback, and 
offering career guidance (Lansbury, 1988). The company's ability to measure employee performance is the basis for 
calibrating the effectiveness of other measurement capabilities (Shang, 2004). The definition of performance 
measurement is often a challenge because organizations have many goals and are often conflicting. The terms 
performance evaluation, performance evaluation, performance management are also used to describe the 
performance measurement process (Islam & Rasad, 2006). 
Employee performance appraisal has been carried out by many companies since a few centuries ago. Performance 
appraisal systems have been widely debated by many people. Overall, performance appraisal is seen as an 
inseparable part of organizational life. Formal performance appraisal must be an important part of the organization, 
because formal assessments are needed as a basis for various human resource decisions, such as salary increases, 
promotions, demotions, terminations, and are also needed to determine employee training needs (Longenecker & 
Fink, 1999). High-performance companies practice performance appraisal as a way to create competitive advantage. 
The application of a performance appraisal system requires sufficient caution. Ineffective scoring systems can bring 
many problems including low morale, decreased employee productivity, reduced employee enthusiasm and support 
for the organization (Somerick, 1993).

The next step is to evaluate employee performance using the 360 degree feedback method, where the performance 
evaluation of an employee is carried out by superiors, by colleagues, and by himself. The assessments carried out by 
each party have different weights, based on a paired comparison assessment. Valuation by superiors has a weight of 
0.344, assessment by colleagues has a weight of 0.415, and self-assessment weighs 0.241. 
 
Table 5 shows the results of the subfactor assessment recapitulation conducted on 40 respondents as assessed 
employees. For each subfactor, look for the minimum value, maximum value, and average value. The maximum 
value obtained by employees from all subfactors is shown in column 6, while the minimum value obtained by 
employees from all subfactors is shown in column 7.

nursing modalities, leadership, and ability to make decisions, with an average value of 3,800, 3,720, and 3,765, 
respectively. The three sub-factors are part of the work competency factor which has the highest or most important 
priority weight to achieve good performance values. It is recommended that paramedic members should pay more 
attention and try to make improvements by increasing understanding or conducting discussions with superiors or 
coworkers about the shortcomings or difficulties faced in order to improve and improve the performance of the 
nurse members themselves. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Employee performance appraisal is often crucial. The subjectivity of the assessor can influence the results of the 
assessment. Appraisers can provide different assessments of employee perceptions. Separate performance appraisals 
between superiors and co-workers with the value of the employees themselves will make a difference. This 
difference in value is called a negative gap. Employee valuation methods that involve many parties will result in a 
better level of assessment. Employee assessment methods that integrate 360 degree feedback and AHP can be used 
to reduce the negative gap value that occurs. In the case of nurses in mental hospitals, the results of the performance 
appraisal were sufficient to satisfy the employees.

Abstract 
Construction is a process which involves numerous parties having their own goals and objectives towards achieving 
a desired goal. Thus, formation of conflicts amongst different parties are common in construction projects as each 
party is working for its own benefit. Conflicts should be avoided at the first instance, as it may consume huge sum of 
money and time to resolve. Therefore it is beneficial if the conflicts can be avoided at the pre contract stage which is 
the foremost stage of a construction project. Hence the aim of this research is to develop a pre contract practice which 
would avoid conflicts at the construction stage.  
A preliminary interview was initially conducted amongst three industrial experts in construction field to identify the 
activities in the pre contract practice to eliminate the causes of conflicts. Then a questionnaire survey was followed 
to identify the significant activities in pre contract practice.  Preliminary interview findings identified 105 activities 
which can be followed in pre contract practice to avoid conflicts.  Further, 97 activities were identified as significant 
in the questionnaire survey. Thus, this paper solely address the causes of conflicts by suggesting activities in pre 
contract stage to eliminate the conflict in the construction industry.

1. Introduction
Construction is a complex process which needs variety of skills and competencies (Bertelsen, 2003).
Therefore many discrete groups with different goals and needs get into temporarily assembled multiple-
party organization (TMO) to work in the construction project (Walker, 1996). Each group expects to
maximize their own benefits. Conflicts in the construction project environment are inevitable due to this
perception difference among the parties of the TMO (Jayasena & Kavinda, 2012). Thus, Collins Cobuild
English dictionary (1995) defines conflict as “a state of opposition between ideas, interests, etc.
disagreement or controversy”. Conflicts may occur due to shortage of limited resources, such as time,
money, labour, materials and equipment (Kathleen, 2003). Hohns (1979) had identified five factors which
may cause conflicts in construction projects. They are existence of errors, failures in estimating cost at the
beginning, reaction of consumer and people involved, change in conditions and defects or omissions in the
contract documents. On another study by Kumaraswamy (1997) determined ten causes for conflicts as
inadequate design information, inaccurate design information, inadequate site investigations, slow client
response, poor communications, unrealistic time targets, inadequate contract administration, uncontrollable
external events, incomplete tender information and unclear risk allocation. Thus, improper management of
conflicts leads to project delays, undetermined team spirit, increase project costs and damage continuing
business relationships if they are not properly managed (Cheung & Suen, 2002). Therefore causes of
conflicts should be properly identified and managed to avoid unnecessary issues in construction projects.
It is noted that most of the causes could be well managed in the pre contract stage (ref). Pre contract stage 
can be defined as the stage prior to commencement of work on site according to the traditional stages in

5. Conclusions  
The construction industry is a place where conflicts are inevitable because multi-disciplinary parties are 
involved. Thus this study identified 50 causes which creates conflicts in the construction projects through 
a literature review. Accordingly 105 activities in the pre-construction stage which would eliminate the 
above identified causes were identified and carried forward to a questionnaire survey. Thus, 97 activities 
was identified as significant and refined pre contract practice was proposed through RIBA plan of work to 
avoid conflicts in construction stage. Contractor should attend in pre bid meeting and ask the things need 
to be clarified, Contractor should prepare a realistic program, Contractor should identify the work correctly 
when pricing; send tender questionnaires for clarifications in the tender document, define the completion 
date are identified as important practice among all identified practices through survey. Anyhow, all of these 
practices need to follow in each stage of RIBA plan of work throughout the pre contract stage to avoid the 
conflicts in project construction stage.

Abstract 
The prediction of the mechanical properties of hot rolled steel sheet is one of the most challenging tasks for the steel 
manufacturer. Typically, the chemical composition of raw material for hot rolling process is not stable. Therefore steel 
manufacturer has to predict the mechanical properties including yield strength (YS), tensile strength (TS) and 
elongation (EL) based on input chemical composition. Currently, the method for prediction is the simple linear 
regression (SLR). The predictor in SLR is only the carbon equivalent which is inadequate to accurately predict the 
mechanical properties. Thus, this paper proposes the multiple linear regression (MLR) to determine more accurate 
regression equation. There are three important rolling process parameters considered in MLR including sheet 
thickness, finish temperature, and coiling temperature. It is found that MLR can yield better prediction value in terms 
of yield strength and elongation while SLR is still the appropriate method for the prediction of tensile strength. Based 
on the comparisons, both SLR and MLR can enhance the accuracy in predicting the mechanical properties of hot 
rolled steel sheet.

1. Introduction
Hot rolled steel sheet for some business, for instant, the automotive industry are required the high quality and the 
specialized properties. The high quality of the hot rolled steel sheet can be reflexed by the mechanical properties. In 
hot rolling process (or hot strip mill), there are many parameters that can affect the mechanical properties. In present, 
the prediction of quality characteristics of the hot rolled steel sheets for automotive industry has been performed by 
utilizing the simple linear regression model. The input data including the material compositions and hot rolling process 
parameters are considered as the independent variables in prediction equation. Not only the input parameters but also 
the output data from hot rolling process were continuously collected from production line. These big data have been 
utilized in anticipating the mechanical properties of hot rolled steel sheet. In present, customer requirement for the 
mechanical properties is so variety depending on customers. Therefore, manufacturer give much attention in process 
control of hot rolling process so that they can accurate control the vital material properties. This paper intends to 
determine the accurate mathematical model that is more accurate in predicting the important quality characteristics of 
hot rolled sheet.  
The use of big data from prediction of mechanical properties have been received much interest in the many 
manufacturing. There are many techniques that can be utilized to make the mathematical model in order to study the

5. Conclusions 
 
This paper aims to improve the control of hot rolling process. In order to achieve proper process control, the regression 
equation is needed to be appropriately modeled so that the quality characteristics in terms of yield strength, tensile 
strength, and elongation will be accurately predicted and controlled. The current prediction method of this steel 
manufacturer relies on only the carbon equivalent as Equation (1) and the simple liner regression is mainly used for 
predicting the mechanical properties. To improve the prediction of these mechanical properties, the multiple linear 
regression (MLR) model is employed to deal with the accuracy of prediction. The addition of factors which are hot 
rolling process parameters, thickness, and material composition successfully yields more appropriate prediction 
models for YS and EL. However, the SLR model is still the preferable method for prediction of the tensile strength. 
It can be concluded that the big data and the mathematical modeling techniques can significantly improve the 
prediction of the mechanical properties of hot rolled steel sheet in coil.  
In addition, these prediction equations can be utilized for process control so as to get the desired product 
characteristics. The recommended process parameters can be determined by solving these equations with optimization 
approach as well. The future research that should be done is the development on the accurate prediction equation by 
other modeling techniques.

Abstract 
 
Internet has been rapidly develop and bring an e-commerce activity as a daily needs, includes in Indonesia. 
One of e-commerce practice is C2C, such as Kaskus, which evolves into social-commerce. Social-
commerce creates connection between product and community. Lately, Kaskus has facing many problems 
within business develops with others e-commerce. In the internal section, there was lack of employees 
competency, whilst in the external section they were wondering about Kaskus FJB (Trading Forum) 
continuity. SWOT methods and PESTLE analysis were applied to solves these problems. SWOT concluded 
that students college may selected as a new employement, considering their potential market and 
development skill. PESTLE was used as a based to determine new service inside Kaskus, resulted in 
suggestion to create tourism page. Therefore, Kaskus will be able to compete with others e-commerce.

Introduction 
Information technology in digital era is effecting in daily needs such as social and other 
life aspect. Today, people around the world are use internet to share and find an information. In 
this digital era, all activity in traditional culture has been changed into modern culture. For 
example, buying and selling activities are now digitally, learning activities can be accessed by 
internet, etc. [1]. Today, people are not strange about e-commerce. E-commerce is a business 
model in which transactions take place over electronic networks, especially internet. There are lot 
of e-commerce arround the world who are in competitor [2]. In Indonesia, retail e-commerce sales 
figures from 2016 is up from 5.78 billion U.S. dollars, then in 2022 is predict e-commerce sales 
set to surpass 14.4 billion U.S. dollars in revenues [3]. There are classification of  e-commerce 
such as B2B, B2C, C2C, C2B. In this paper, researcher discuss about e-commerce in C2C model 
[4]. The growth of e-commerce are influence by industry structure, there are many individual 
businessman comes in business world. They use internet as an instrument for online marketplace. 
Online marketplace is one of C2C model. This model usually take advantages on website to 
promote and create online transaction [5]. Implementation of C2C model could be a social-
commerce, by using social media as media for transaction of product or service [6]. Social-
commerce is representative from Web 2.0. It is gives information by one person to others (monolog 
media) or by people to others (social media monolog). Some examples of Web 2.0 social media 
sites include blogs, web forums, virtual communities, and social networks [7]. One of social-
commerece implementation in Indonesia is Kaskus [8].

By PESTLE analysis, it can concluded that tourism page is better to add in. Because, it 
make easy people to get information, souvenirs, accomodation, and tourism package. Beside a new 
policy, tourism page can increase visitors and advertisement in Kaskus. Then, Kaskus could be 
famous as a social e-commerce in society.

Conclusion 
To need for programmers need to be addressed as a long-term problem that must be 
resolved properly. By utilize the potential of fresh graduates will be the best solution when 
compared to hiring developers programmers in now. It is cause by company's limitations and future 
of kaskus. Younger developers will have more creative power when trained well. Therefore, 
recruiting potential programmers from among students with the concept of tiered recruitment, 
scholarship, and training to be the right choice of kaskus to solve human resources problem kaskus 
in the future. 
 
5. 
Research Direction 
The finding of study could be used as a basis for Kaskus to set up policy toward 
implementation results by SWOT and PESTLE analysis. Freshgraduates are necessary to complete 
human resource in Kaskus as potential empolyement. It can be utilized to create innovation and 
creativity within Kaskus. In other side, Tourism page should be implemented because it can 
improve Kaskus’s benefit and total visitors in tourism spot. This study could give an implicit 
recommendation to create innovation inside e-commerce. Further study should giving results about 
Kaskus development. SWOT and PESTLE analysis could be a basis for next study. It is also 
combine by others methods which influence in e-commerce. The next study, researcher should be

Abstract 
Sharif (1986) defined technology into Technoware (physical thing), Humanware (human), Infoware 
(knowledge), and Orgaware (social component) or simply as THIO.  Further, Sharif (2012), Huang dan 
Cox (2016), and Gudanowska (2016) added that one component which makes organization system may 
collaborate electronically through Cysnetware called as THIOC. Kilubi (2015) and Kilubi and Haasis 
(2016) identified 2 (two) other components to be united into THIO’s frame, they were Manageware (M) 
and Partnerware (P), called as THIOCMP. All of those components of technology was used to measure 
technology contribution in an industry, called by Technometrics.  The technology contribution in 
Technometrics is called as Technology Contribution Coefficient (TCC). In measuring the TCC, the first 
thing to do is measure the level of sophistication to know the company's position in terms of technology 
utilization. Sharif (2012) uses the degree of sophistication of technological components as a measure of 
technological innovation. Sharif (2012) conducted sophistication degree of THIOC components. However, 
there is no any research in developing sophistication degree for M and P components yet. This paper aims 
to develop the sophistication degree of M and P components of technology using Concept Mapping (CM). 
Trochim and McLinden (2017) explained that CM is a unique integration of qualitative and quantitative 
methods designed to enable a group of people to articulate and depict graphically a coherent conceptual 
framework or model of any topic or issue of interest. Furthermore, Jackson and Trochim (2002) described 
that this method appears to be especially well suited for the type of text generated by open-ended questions 
as well for organizational research questions that are exploratory in nature, aimed at scale or interview 
question development, and/or developing conceptual coding schemes. Six steps to estimate the 
sophistication degree of M and P components using CM consist of Preparation; Generation; Structuring; 
Representation; Interpretation; and Utilization. Preparation step focused to identify the specific elements 
and identify the participants that will be related with the sophistication degree of M and P components. The 
generation step is used to generate the statement that represents the supporting component of M and P, 
respectively. There are 6 (six) supporting components of M, and 14 (fourteen) components of P. The third 
step, structuring the statement by adjusting the scoring of the statement. Each participant scores each 
statement on a 5-point Likert-type response scale for each desired scoring. In the representation step, the 
score result of the statement is processed using XLStat software and the results of multidimensional scaling 
(MDS) configuration are obtained. The results of processing the score of M and P components are valid 
because the Kruskal's stress value is greater than the probability value of 0.05. In the interpretation step, the 
statement grouping is shown on the point rating map. The position of the point shows closeness because of 
similarity between statements. Then statements are combined in the form of clusters and given names. The

Abstract 
Today, the business world is moving towards the “Green Concept” and most organizations focus on increasing 
performance in their operations while reducing the impact on environment. In manufacturing sector, adopting green 
concept in to managing supply chains is getting an increasing attention due to higher possibility of environmental 
impact during supply chain activities. The purpose of this study is to identify the direct impact of green supply chain 
management (GSCM) practices on different dimensions of operational performance (flexibility, delivery, quality, & 
cost) and the indirect impact through these on customer satisfaction. Data have been collected through a survey for 
which a total of 94 managers in manufacturing organizations responded. Partial Least Square Structural Equation 
Modeling (PLS-SEM) was applied to analyze the data and SmartsPLS software was used. The study revealed that 
(GSCM) Practices lead to improve all dimensions of operational performance (flexibility, delivery, quality and cost) 
where only production flexibility and delivery significantly in turn improves customer satisfaction. Any indirect 
impact of GSCM practices on customer satisfaction through production cost and quality was not found in the study.   
This research has several important implications for manufacturers who have implemented and are willing to 
implement GSCM practices in their firms. In addition, the study significantly contributes to the literature by 
providing empirical evidence for the impact of four dimensions of GSCM practices (green purchasing, cooperation 
with customers, eco-design, and investment recovery) on operational performance and customer satisfaction. 
Keywords: Green Supply Chain Management Practices, Operational Performance, Customer Satisfaction. 
1. Introduction 
Today, the business world is moving toward the “Green Concept”. Most of organizations focus on increasing 
efficiency of resources while reducing the impact on human health, productivity and environment. Supply chain 
management is the main activity in the manufacturing firm. Therefore, most of manufacturing firms are 
incorporating with the green supply chain management (GSCM) practices into their operations for reducing 
pollution and wastage, recycling and reusing, minimizing natural resource uses and reducing emission. (K. G. A. S. 
Waidyasekara and R. L. N. Sandamali , 2012). Many manufacturers pay attention to customer expectations and 
current customers are highly knowledgeable and consider the environmental impact mostly. They pressure to 
manufacturer to avoid the environmental harmful activities and protect the environment. Most of customers are 
becoming increasingly knowledgeable and demanding for environmentally friendly products (Thoo Ai Chin, et al., 
2015). Supply chain management interacts with suppliers, manufacturers and customers to enhance the efficiency 
and productivity.  Customer is an important party for business organizations for their sustainability. Therefore, it 
will be worthwhile to study the impact of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices on operational 
performance and customer satisfaction. 
 
Existing literature suggests that manufacturing organizations should adopt environmental sustainability and 
successful implementation of GSCM practices will lead to reduce waste, save money, green marketing awareness, 
improve employee morale, fulfill public response and then increase organization overall performance including 
environmental, economic and operational performance ( Lorette, Kristie, 2018)

5 Conclusion  
There is no comprehensive investigation of the relationship of GSCM practices (green purchasing, cooperation with 
customers, eco-design and investment recovery) with operational performance (flexibility, delivery, quality and 
cost) and customer satisfaction. Therefore, this research study contributes to the literature providing empirical 
evidence for the impact of GSCM practices on operational performance and customer satisfaction. According to the 
results of the study, both of individual dimensions of GSCM practices and overall GSCM practices are significantly 
and positively linked with all the dimensions of operational performance. However, only the indirect impact through 
flexibility and delivery on customer satisfaction are indirectly associated with customer satisfaction while quality 
and cost have no significant mediating effect impact. 
 
6. Theoretical and Managerial implications  
 
This research study provides empirical evidence for the impact of four dimensions of GSCM practices (green 
purchasing, cooperation with customers, eco-design and investment recovery) on four operational performance 
dimensions (flexibility, delivery, quality, and cost) and customer satisfaction. According to the respondents of the 
study, most of the manufacturing firms already have begun to implement GSCM practices such as considering 
suppliers‟ ISO 14000 certification; providing design specification to suppliers that include environmental 
requirement for purchased item; cooperating with customers for green packaging; cooperating with customers using 
less energy during product transportation; designing product for reuse, recycle, recovery of material/components 
parts; selling the scrap and used materials etc.  Existing literature suggests that specific activities to support 
environmental collaboration, monitoring and control including monitoring reverse ﬂows of materials; sharing 
techniques and knowledge related to environmental management with supply chain partners; working to control the 
environmental risk associated with suppliers‟ operations; and working to assure proper product use (Vachon, S., 
2007).These  findings offer  directions to manufacturers to enhance operational performance and customer 
satisfaction while implementing environmental practices throughout their supply chain. 
 
7. Limitations and future research 
 
This study has a few limitations that might be overcome in future research in similar field.  Data were collected only 
from manufacturing managers in Sri Lanka. If a future study increases the sample size and collect data from 
worldwide manufacturers, those findings will be valid to a broader context.  In particular, the mediating role of 
quality and cost which found insignificant in this study can be reexamined. as a mediator. In addition, in depth 
studies that collect data from different managers within a selected manufacturing firm may explore a detailed 
information related to the relationships revealed in this study.

Abstract 
Shipping lines play a major role in economic development of a country by contributing to the international trade in 
every industry. Therefore, optimizing operations in these firms would be of a great importance and this could be 
effectively done through IT-based solutions. Therefore, this study was carried out to explore an in depth 
understanding on whether there is feasibility to optimize shipping line operations through increasing the usage of IT 
solutions. The study used both primary and secondary data to achieve its objectives. First, secondary data were used 
to identify current issues in shipping line operations and they were obtained from a database maintained by a 
selected shipping line in Sri Lanka. Secondly, primary data were used to identify current system issues, the benefits 
of system, and solutions to avoid the existing issues. To collect primary data, a survey was conducted where the 
respondents were 47 import and export staff in shipping line companies in Sri Lanka. After collecting data, A 
detailed descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, independent sample t-test, and Chi-square test were 
performed to analyse the data. The findings of this study will lead to effective implementation of IT solutions for 
optimizing shipping line operations. Particularly it emphasizes the importance of installing integrated collaboration 
systems as their potential to overcome many optimization issues is very high.

1. Introduction
Shipping lines are third party logistic companies mainly involve in import and export consignment of all types of 
consumer goods, raw material, and fuel. They are backbone of international trade in every industry of a country. 
They have to follow a huge, complicated process in the import and export trade. Well-optimized shipping line 
operations facilitate organizations to carry out their operations properly through properly handling import and export 
activities. To carry out shipping line operations properly, they have to   make a lot of efforts to collect and manage 
right and timely information. Those efforts incur higher costs to organizations.  
ABC Pvt Ltd is a shipping line and a clearing agency. There are several issues including bottlenecks, great 
uncertainty, unmanageable workloads and problem of effective use time that can be identified in the organization’s 
operations. This study was conducted to identify the operational issue and to evaluate the ability to optimize 
shipping line operations using Information Technology.  
2. Literature review
2.1 Challenges/Issues in Shipping Line Operations and Their Impact 
According to IBM business consulting services, there are some identified future trends in shipping lines. According 
to their perspective, the market in future will be free and more open while the industry become more concentrated 
and more focused on customer relationships.  Looking ahead of ten years, they believe that leading container 
shipping lines will have the following characteristics.

When analyzing the relationship between future challenges and current system features using t-test, no significant 
relationship was identified. This implies that current system features would not be sufficient to the face future 
challenges in shipping line industry.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
This study examines whether there is ability to optimize shipping line operations using Information Technology. 
The study used both survey method and secondary data from shipping line companies. The study was also aimed to 
evaluate and understand the issues in shipping line operations and explore the IT related opportunities to overcome 
these issues. 
 
Based on the findings, it can be concluded that time management, inefficient system, inefficient system usage and 
no punctuality as major issues in shipping line operations. To identify feasible IT based solutions, respondents were 
questioned about the software tools, various features in the software, and the ability to face future trends and 
minimize the current issues in shipping line operations. As per the results, organization should try to implement 
software and most importantly, vessel budgeting systems that will particularly help to overcome lack of robust 
network profitability. In addition, the results revealed that the current system features in Sri Lankan shipping lines 
are not sufficient to successfully face future trends. Organization should try to develop their current system with 
important features which have been identified through the study. 
 
6. Implications of the Study 
This study has many important practical and theoretical implications. As the study implies, to avoid the issues in 
shipping line operations, organization should focus on the Information Technology based solution. Shipping line

organizations should avoid operation delay situations, focus on their system capabilities, and try to get proper 
knowledge about the system usage. Shipping line companies should attempt to minimize the barriers to satisfy 
customer requirements through communication breakdown and document delays. Organization also should concern 
about provide punctual service through the use of right IT tools.  
 
The study has some implications for the researchers and academics who explore   knowledge about current issues 
and future challenges in shipping line operations and investigate how to overcome these issues using Information 
Technology tools. This study contributes to literature because there is very limited number of previous research   
focusing on shipping line operations particularly with reference to Sri Lanka. In addition, there was no previous 
research addressing the features of Information Technology tools and their ability to optimize the shipping line 
operations.  
 
7. Limitations and Future Research  
 
This study was conducted for identifying current issues in shipping line operations. For this study used secondary 
data from only one shipping line firm which may not represent the whole industry’s issues. So future researchers can 
conduct research for the whole industry and through that they will be able to identify the issues in shipping lines and 
most suitable software can be introduced to Sri Lanka. This study only examined the possibility to optimize shipping 
line operations using Information Technology based solutions. Future researchers can explore the ways to overcome 
the mentioned issues using Information Technology tools. The small sample size is another limitation of this study. 
The time and resource constraints largely impacted the sample size.

Abstract 
This paper deals with the problem of having a service by solid waste collection sites for surrounding solid waste 
producers, in such a way that waste-induced disaster risk faced by the waste producers is relatively equal. To cope 
with the problem, a location mathematical model of which objective is minimizing the gap between maximum and 
minimum value of waste-induced disaster risk experienced by the waste producers is proposed in the paper. The 
model applicability is subsequently demonstrated by using a problem of having such a relatively fair service taking 
place in the autonomous Regency of Klaten, Central Java, Indonesia. From the application to 2015 problem context 
in the regency, it is concluded that Klaten Regency should build 32 solid waste collection sites in order to minimize 
the gap between maximum and minimum value of waste-induced disaster risk experienced by its 101 solid waste 
producers. The application of the same model to projected 2022 problem context in the same region, in the 
meantime, shows that having a minimum gap between maximum and minimum value of waste-induced disaster risk 
for the 101 solid waste producers can be obtained by establishing 33 solid waste collection sites. In general, it is 
conclusive that an equity-based positioning of solid waste collection sites for an equitable waste-induced disaster 
risk is possible to achieve.

1. Motivation
Equality or justice (see, for instance, Pliefke 2008 and Zhang 2014) is an issue of which importance grows 
significantly over time. This includes equality on being exposed to disasters (see, for example, Tafti and Tomlinson 
2018). This is especially crucial for people living in disaster-prone areas. It is generally accepted that waste is 
capable of becoming disastrous once it is not maintained well. Bad waste management results in severe problems 
such as landslide (Defu et al. 2013), disturbance to microhydro power station (Parlan 2013) and harmful impacts to 
land resources and environment (Wang et al. 2010), to name a few.  
In many countries, the existence of solid waste collection sites – to which residents in surrounding areas have 
to send solid waste they produce and from which the waste is subsequently transported to final waste disposal sites – 
is not new. It is also well known that people do not want to reside close to waste sites, a phenomenon known as 
NIMBY (not in my backyard) syndrome (see, for instance, Afullo 2015; Crozier and Hajzler 2010; Feldman and 
Turner 2010; Feldman and Turner 2014; Flynn 201; Hsu 2006; Johnson and Scicchitano 2012; Sakai 2012; Wong 
2016; Wu et al. 2014) or LULU (locally unwanted land use) (see, for example, Kim and Kim 2014; Nakazawa 2017, 
2018; and Schively 2007). All of these facts lead to the need of positioning shared waste facilities relatively equally. 
This is even more important in the presence of a drastically growing solid waste production, a circumstance 
occurring in many places around the world. 
People concerned with waste-caused problems are already familiar with operations research techniques and 
methods in aiding the management of waste. In particular, the use of location models in waste operation context is 
abundant (see, for instance, Erkut et al. 2008; Ghiani et al. 2012; Korucu et al. 2013; Korucu and Karademir 2014; 
Ojha et al. 2007). It is clear from previous paragraphs that having waste facilities with relatively equal services to 
their users is of importance. Location models of p-center or p-dispersion, in the meantime, particularly aims at 
getting solutions with fairness for all parties. The search by the authors, however, found that the use of p-center 
models as well as p-dispersion ones on the positioning of waste facilities is not many (see, for instance, Maharani,

Abstract 
Innovation is an essential support for the organization's survival in the market. In this context, the 
advancement of technology can provide inputs for organizations to produce a consolidated position in a 
such competitive and technological world. Emerging technologies of Industry 4.0, like Internet of Things, 
Big Data and Simulation, arise in this context bringing terrific transformations in the mode of production 
and consequently in the management of production. The aim of this article is to make visible how these 
tools go far beyond technological innovations, providing aspects capable of assisting in the production 
management, offering, to managers, data that aid the decision making. For this, was analyzed a broad of 
scientific papers present in different journals of Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Scielo, Science Direct and 
Engineering Village. The results show that the use of these technologies can enable organizations to 
improve their processes, faster problem solving, increased productivity and improved process safety. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Continuous advancement of technology is the driving force for innovation. Organizations that want to survive in a 
world so competitive and increasingly digital, seek refuge in technological advancement. The search for intelligent 
production, which will synthesize innovative and intelligent products and / or services, should be the main focus of 
any organization. 
Over time, the industry underwent profound changes, which led to transformations in the manner of production, the 
size of production and consequently the way of managing itself. The First Industrial Revolution began in the mid-
eighteenth century. Through the invention of the steam engine, mankind went from a manual production to a more 
technological and mechanical production. (Guangli et al., 2018) In this context the production had a size, volume 
and variety was considerably reduced. (Yin et al., 2017)

5 Conclusion  
The key point for decision making is knowledge. Technologies provide, through tools, the basis for these decisions 
to be made. The internet of things works with a great integrator of objects, capable of interacting, communicating 
and sharing various information. Big data is capable of storing a large amount of data and the simulation has 
attributes that facilitate beneficial choices for the organization. The integration of these technologies also bring 
diverse benefits to society, contributing to its development and efficiency. 
 
Today, the information base has a huge variety and amount of data. All of these factors contribute to an even greater 
share of technology. The formation of intelligent factories creates a collaborative network of machines capable of 
rapidly exchanging information autonomously. Is it possible that in the future machines alone make decisions? 
Analysis at this point is the starting point for a possible response. 
 
Technology, with its attributes, can become much more precise and assertive, but the human factor is necessary to 
perform information analysis and make the right decisions. These competences encompass aspects that 
mathematical and logical algorithms can not learn and reproduce, such as consciousness, empathy, and creativity. Of 
course more technologies will come. New skills and learning will be demanded. Therefore, the new challenge will 
be the definition of these new competencies for the professional of the future.

Abstract 
Oil and gas industries has for a long time been faced with an increase of accident. For that, enormous efforts are 
maximized to reduce them by improving the safety systems performances of these processes. Safety instrumented 
systems (SISs) are practically considered important elements to avoid dangerous situations. Their availability to 
respond to these situations need to be guaranteed by experts and specialists. This paper presents an overview of 
different methods and used to estimate the unavailability of a safety instrumented systems in any process plant. The 
case study focused on a high integrity pressure protection system (HIPPS) that exists in most process industries and 
requiring high levels of availability for effective safety. First, the system is modelled as reliability block diagram, a 
method often used in the reliability analysis of safety systems. In fact, each part of a system considered to be 
available to make the whole system available and effective while considering the simultaneous failure of each part 
due to common-cause failures. Then, the safety system is modeled as a Petri process, using Petri nets approach. A 
quantitative and numerical evaluation of this model allows assessing better the availability in terms of probability of 
failure on demand (PFD).

Abstract 
Multiproduct Multivehicle Inventory Routing  (MMIRP) is an extension of the Inventory 
Routing Problem (IRP) that integrating route and inventory decisions simultaneously to 
minimize total transportation and inventory costs. This paper aims to implement The MMIRP 
method to design the routes of LPG distribution in Indonesian LPG supply chain.The MMIRP 
model of this article considers two products: 5.5 kg and 12 kg LPG and 2 vehicles to dispersed 
sub-agent and retailer customers. The existing distribution activities the company does not pay 
attention a route sequence and inventory at the customers so the expenses of transportation 
costs are very high and when the customer visited the inventory level is still high. The problems 
are solved using Mixed Integer Linear Programming with LINGO software. The results 
obtained after applying MMIRP resulted in a total distance can savings of 1.75% or 9.77 km, 
reducing total fuel consumption of 13.39% or 11.84 liters and minimizing total transportation 
and inventory costs by 16.01%.

Abstract 
Nowadays air pollution is the leading concern among the people. To be safe from the polluted air, using the available 
general mask is not sufficient to avoid severe health hazards. If modern technology can be embedded into a mask with 
every layer of protection from the air pollution then it will be a safer mask to use. This paper is about to develop a 
more advanced mask with a different layer of protection from dust, bacteria and hazardous elements of the air in low 
cost with wirelessly airflow control system. The product ensures 94% purification of air with its embedded technology. 
Before developing the mask a survey has been done and the product is designed on the basis of customer requirement. 
Materials of the product are selected through the relative performance index of the key features. This will be made at 
the lightweight so that users will feel comfortable to use. The Product is targeted to the customers’ e.g.  Factory 
workers, Medical Patient, General People. The product is low power consumption and can be charged fast. It can be 
run about 8 hours with fully charged.

Introduction 
It is estimated that outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million excess deaths worldwide each year. There is a good reason 
to worry about Air Quality at the Environmental Performance Index for Air Quality. According to the World Health 
Organization, 91% of the world’s population lives in places where air quality exceeds WHO guideline limits. The cost 
of a polluted environment: 1.7 million child deaths a year, says WHO. Air pollution acts as a silent killer.9 out of 10 
people worldwide breathe polluted air. 
Air pollution levels increasing in many of the world’s underdeveloped and developing cities. Most of the air pollution 
is happening to the industrial area and it is now unstoppable. And it is also uncontrollable to purify the air of the whole 
industry. Thus, the workers of the industry are facing very severe health problems because of air pollution. The musk 
they wear barely remove the hazardous and finer particles which cause very bad effects on their health. Most of the 
factory workers don’t wear a mask due to their loss of lung capacity, bronchitis, asthma etc. People are facing lack of 
sleep and are getting tired because of breathing the polluted air more and more. 
Advanced Air Purifier Facial Mask is designed to provide 94% purified air. This project idea also includes bacteria 
killing by UV light protection. This mask can remove the fine particles of below 0.3 microns and Nanoparticles easily 
and efficiently. Normal masks can’t provide all the protections. In this product, anyone the smokes, fumes, odors, and 
chemicals are removed through the carbon filter. Then the HEPA filter is generally used to separate the dust, particles 
larger than 0.3 microns etc. A polarizer is used for the advanced bacteria protection and separation of the particles 
from the air and with Nano filter removes the other particles of Nano level. The air pump is used in this product for a 
better-controlled supply of air. It gives wireless connectivity up to 10 meters.

Conclusion: 
The main aim of this research is designing and building a low cost, wirelessly controlled advanced air purifying facial 
mask. This system is both wireless and manually controlled. As the system is battery powered and low noise making 
air pump is used, so the noise interference is reduced and subject safety is ensured. The cost of the system is USD 
21.825 which is ideal for under developed and developed countries. The component used for this system consumes 
very low power and it takes maximum current of 55 mA. It is capable of running about 8hrs by one full charge. It can 
be more cost efficient by further development in future.

Abstract 
Digital Human Modeling (DHM), the process of CAD representation of human body form, is an emerging tool used 
to simulate workplaces in order to provide solutions for ergonomics related problems. Digital humans/manikins are 
being incorporated in the software, can be manipulated easily and assessed for work related discomfort, injuries and 
workplace design. Manual workers in small scale industries are often exposed to work related discomfort and pain 
while performing work. These exposures may lead to development of work related musculoskeletal disorders 
(WRMSDs) and low back pain (LBP), affecting the efficiency of workers and productivity of the industry. The main 
objective of current study is to analyze the working postures of manual workers in small scale industries by using 
Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) assessment in CATIA V5R20 software.  The workers in stone cutting and 
polishing industry were selected, and found to be working in awkward postures involving heavy manual lifting, 
bending, twisting and turning of the trunk. Most of the postures indicated a high risk score of 7, indicating changes 
in the posture to be done immediately. Ergonomic interventions were suggested and the improved posture was 
evaluated using RULA and the posture indicated a score of 3, indicating low risk. The manual lifting task was also 
assessed using NIOSH lifting equation at the origin and destination of lift, using CATIA V5R20. The ergonomic 
interventions reduced the value of lifting index from 1.79 to 0.98, indicating safe limit. The results indicate that 
awkward working posture risks can be minimized by effectively using ergonomic interventions.

destination.

In order to reduce the value of lifting index and hence reduce the risks of low back pain and injuries to the operator, 
ergonomic redesign of the task is necessary. The measures taken to reduce the value of lifting index are 1) To adapt 
a push cart or trolley to carry the stone slabs. 2) Modifications of the variables are suggested. 3) Raising the height 
of the place at origin by building a platform. The changes made are shown in figure 6 above. With the necessary 
changes in the workplace the lifting index value is 1.2 at the origin of lift and 0.98 at the destination. A lifting index 
value of less than 1 indicates the lifting load is safe for the operator.

Conclusion 
Digital Human Models and simulation have emerged as significant tools to facilitate proactive ergonomic 
investigations. The DHM technologies have allowed the ergonomist to early identification of ergonomic issues, and 
reduce or eliminate the need for physical and real human operator testing.  
Based on the results obtained from the studies conducted in the stone quarry and stone polishing industries, the 
working postures practiced by the workers while performing tasks are risky and unsafe. More workers are required 
to work in unsafe conditions handling heavy loads repetitively. The RULA method used to analyze the working 
postures indicated that about 57% postures in manual cutting, 50% postures in machine cutting and 46% postures in 
polishing units are in high category requiring further investigation and immediate change. Some of the postures were 
modeled in CATIA V5 to find out the risk levels, and the improvements were suggested based on CATIA results. In 
one case of lifting of heavy stone slabs in stone quarry, the RULA score is reduced to 3and 4 indicating medium 
risk, by incorporating engineering controls. Similarly in the polishing unit the RULA score for some postures is 7 in

the high risk category. This can be brought down by incorporating ergonomic design of the workplace and hence the 
RULA score in reduced to 3 and 4. To determine the risks of workers to lower back pain and discomfort, NIOSH 
lifting equation was used to calculate the recommended weight limit and lifting index. In a particular case, the value 
of lifting index was brought down from 1.79 to 0.98, indicating safe limits. Overall the work in stone quarry and 
stone polishing units involves manual work with less amount of mechanization. It is suggested to use push carts and 
trolleys for movement of heavy stone slabs. For lifting and lowering the stone slabs it is recommended to encourage 
team lifting by two or more persons to reduce the stress on the workers. An example of the suggestion made is 
shown in figure 7, the use of push cart with a scissor lift so that the height of the trolley can be raised or lowered. 
This helps in avoiding the forward bending and heavy lifting of the operators. Also the use of such trolley reduced 
the RULA score.

Abstract 
This paper outlines a comparative study between the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and the 
ASEAN Credit Transfer System (ACTS). In 2015, ASEAN member countries will form the ASEAN Economic 
Community (AEC), a region promoting economic integration and the subsequent free flow of people, trade and culture. 
The AEC will have significant impacts on higher education across the ASEAN region, and this research investigates 
how knowledge management techniques can be utilized to respond effectively to the forthcoming ACTS. The ACTS 
is a tool created to enhance and facilitate credit transfer allocation between members of the ASEAN University 
Network (AUN) and will present particular challenges for Thailand’s university administration and management. The 
paper presents a case study from Thailand, and leverages Common Knowledge Acquisition and Documentation 
Structuring (CommonKADS) to capture appropriate knowledge from Europe, where a successful Europe-wide credit 
transfer system already exists. The paper undertakes a comparative study between the ECTS and the proposed ACTS. 
The case study is based within the Faculties of Law, at Chiang Mai University (CMU), Thailand, and University 
Lumière Lyon 2, France. In Thailand, a requirement exists to prepare and provide a new framework to ensure its 
Credit Transfer System (CTS) procedure correlates with the needs of the ASEAN University Network CTS (AUN-
CTS). The AUN-CTS is a particular aspect of the AUN, which members must adhere to. This research therefore 
studies the importance and usefulness of the ECTS in comparison to the ACTS and more importantly, captures existing 
and relevant knowledge from the ECTS to raise awareness and enhance the credit transfer procedure of the CMU law 
faculty. Results show that utilizing knowledge to create a successful credit transfer allocation will facilitate increased 
student and faculty exchange, including training programs and worker mobility.

1. Introduction
A credit transfer system is an important facilitate instrument for academic exchange programs. A successful 
ASEAN credit transfer allocation will facilitate students’ mobility within ASEAN universities. In 2010, there was no 
such a reliable international credit transfer system at Chiang Mai University (CMU). The CMU was not familiar with 
any cooperation of undergraduate student international exchange program. Although, the AEC 2015 was effective 
implemented in December 31, 2015. Up until 2016, the Faculty of Law, Chiang Mai University sought to acquire a 
quality assurance ASEAN Credit Transfer Model to accommodate its undergraduate students’ international mobility, 
especially intra ASEAN University Network. In order to have a prompt and credential of grade and a number of credits 
transfer from host country to home country, a study of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) was initiated. 
The ECTS is a successful European Credit Transfer System, globally. In this study, a knowledge management 
approach was proposed and suggested by using a CommonKADS technique. This research leverages its fundamental

5. Discussion & Conclusion 
 
In this study, the 2 groups of expert interview from CMU and University Lumiere’ Lyon 2 were performed 
with the ECTS model was examined. A CommonKADS technique is applied to capture appropriate knowledge from 
Europe. The case study is based within the Faculties of Law, at Chiang Mai University, Thailand, and University 
Lumiere Lyon2, France. This research therefore studies the importance and usefulness of the ECTS in comparison to 
the ACTS. As of 2016, there is no AUN credit transfer system in CMU and ASEAN University Network.  In this 
research, a model of ASEAN University Network Credit Transfer System was created. It provides a process for student 
and faculty academic exchange through the University Notification Rules and Regulations. There are 3 types of ACTS-
CMU credit transfer: Type I Direct Credit Transfer, Type II Transformation Credit Transfer and Type III Auditing. 
The AUN-CTS is a particular aspect of the AUN, which members must adhere to. Results show that utilizing 
knowledge to create a successful credit transfer allocation will facilitate increased student and faculty exchange, 
including training programs and worker mobility.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 is an emerging term that has drawn great attention the past few years. It consists of variety of technologies 
including internet of things, cloud computing, sensor, mobile devices, big data. The goal of industry 4.0 is to 
incorporate these technologies to create the factories that are highly efficient and highly adaptive to meet 
organizational goals. The adoption of this concepts has been reported worldwide in various name such as “Industrial 
Internet of Things” in the US or “the Made in China 2025 initiative” in China. However, there is no publication of the 
current situation of the adoption in Thailand. This paper presents a survey of current adoption of the concept of industry 
4.0 in Thai industries in the attempt to identify the gap between the current situation and the ideal situation that the 
industries want to position themselves. The survey was conducted using questionnaires with 50 factories located 
throughout Thailand and across many sectors.  The results were analyzed using association rule mining techniques. It 
was founded that industry 4.0 technologies that has highest percentage of implementation at presents are mobile 
devices and sensor technologies but still there are gaps of need for both technologies. The technology that has not yet 
implemented but has highest need is big data technology. The overall results suggested that, at the moment, it was not 
found the evident that Thai industries have explicit plan to transform their organization with respect to industry 4.0 
concept.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0, a term develop in German, has been regarded as the next generation of industry (Lee, Bagheri, &
Kao, 2015). It is also known in other synonyms such as Smart Manufacturing, Smart Production or Internet of Things 
(Kamble, Gunasekaran, & Gawankar, 2018). Industry 4.0 refers to the collection of current concepts for example 
smart factory, cyber-physical systems, self-organization, and corporate social responsibility (Heiner & Kemper, 2014). 
It focused on creating intelligent factory that increase manufacturing flexibility in the same time mass customized, 
improved quality and productivity. Factory should be able to monitor physical processes and make smart decision 
real-time (Zhong, Xu, Klotz, & Newman, 2017).  
The adoption of this concept have been reported world-wide. In German, industry 4.0 plan was launched in 2013 
in which factory occupied by intelligent machines and products are able to communicate with each other 
autonomously. In The United States, the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) was founded in 2014 with the support 
of GE, AT&T, Cisco, Intel and IBM to provide resources and ideas on the Industrial internet of Things (IIoT). In 
China, the Made in China 2025 initiatives was set up by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (Zhong 
et al., 2017). In Korea, the term the fourth industrial revolution is more widely accepted by Korean government and 
numbers of initiatives has been setup (Sung, 2018). However, there has been no report on the current adoption in 
Thailand. 
This research is a part of MSIE-CBHE project or the Erasmus+ Curriculum Development of Master’s Degree 
Program in Industrial Engineering for Thailand Sustainable Smart Industry -MSIE4.0 project funded by the European 
Commission (project number 586137-EPP-I-2017-I-TH-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP). The objective of the project is to design 
a master’s degree program that prepare Thai student to have adequate skill in the context of industry 4.0. The project

Figure 6 shows links between features of smart operations concepts. Most of the links are highly correlated 
between data collected and shared cross-enterprise (externally). For example, there are connections between 
production and research and development data, purchasing and production data, sales and finance data, purchasing 
and finance data. 
Table 3 lists 10 rules extracted from the total of 18 rules extracted from model 3. Association rules use “if/then” 
statements to uncover relationships in data. The premises column in Table 3 is the “if” part, while the conclusion 
column is the “then” part. Support is the probability that both premises and conclusion are found together in the 
database. Confidence measures how often the rule has been found to be true. For example, rule number 3 (RD external 
⇒ Production external) showed support of 0.54 and confidence of 0.871; this means that in 54% of company who 
select both sharing R&D data externally and sharing production data externally, and 87.1% of companies that select 
sharing R&D data externally also select sharing production data externally. 
Table 3: Association rules from model 3. 
 
Table 3 shows highly correlation among data sharing externally. For example, R&D and production data are 
related together (rule 3, and rule 7), purchasing data are correlated with production data (rule 8) and service data are 
correlated with R&D data (rule 3). 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper presents the analysis of survey result from the questionnaire of 50 Thai large scale companies regarding 
to the adoption of industry 4.0 concept. The results suggested that most Thai companies are operating at less than ideal 
status. Biggest gaps in terms of technologies are founded to be Big data, M2M and sensor technology. Currently, less 
than half of the companies surveyed applied some of the industry 4.0 concept in their operational function especially 
sales, logistics and purchasing. However, ideally they would like to increase their adoption in all the fuctions. The 
functions that shows the biggest gap are IT, production, and R&D. 
The results from association rules mining reveal that for Thai industry, in strategy level, technologies that Thai 
companies already have are mobile devices and sensor. These technologies have direct links to their need, for example. 
the company who has mobile device technology also express need for that technology. Most Thai industry does not 
have big data technology yet but there is a strong link of those who already need and have sensor technology to the 
need of big data in the future. Big data can be identified as a gap for Thai Industry that need to be fulfilled.   
For the adoption level, For Thai companies regarding the concept of smart factory, the technologies already 
implemented are M2M and interoperability. M2M communication has link to sensor, mobile device and big data. The 
link between M2M and sensor is obvious since sensor is one of the most important parts in order for M2M to work. 
Mobile device helps to access M2M data anywhere and big data helps to analyze M2M data.  
For the concept of smart operation, the results suggested that for Thai and EU data are stored and used externally 
and they are highly co-related. There is no link to technology need on the Thai side but there are link from current

smart operation data to the big data technology. For data driven service aspects, only frequent itemset can but found 
but no rules between them. 
To sum up there are certain gaps between current status of companies to the concept of industry 4.0, both in 
strategy level and adoption level. Once the gaps have been identified, there is immediate need for the design of new 
industrial engineering curriculum that incorporate those need in to the design in order to prepare workforce with the 
right skill that are able to work efficiently regarding to industry 40 concept.

Abstract 
The SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) constitute 98% of the Moroccan economics. 
They represent the real nerve center of our economy with 40% of production and 31% of 
exports. They are present in all sectors of Moroccan economic activity; however, an alarming 
report from inforisk notes an 8% increase in business failure in 2018, compared with only 1% 
of corporate default growth worldwide. Indeed, 40% of the failures of the Moroccan 
companies are due to unpaid bills, and 70% of our companies support delays of payment 
higher than 90 days. In a context of recession and economic crisis, banks are increasingly 
reluctant to grant credit, not having or having very few assets, such as machines, premises and 
vehicles. The SMEs cannot access to conventional financing except at quasi-prohibitive rates, 
which makes late payments very difficult for the latter to absorb. The purpose of our study is 
to understand through system dynamics causal loop diagram, the impact of late payments on 
the financial health of the supply chain by considering two variables, namely the cash in hand 
and the inventory. As we applied our model to a Moroccan distribution firm, the study 
showed that large firm absorbs delay in payment.

1. Introduction
Over the course of history, supply chains have emerged to meet the diverse needs of human societies, to exploit 
natural resources, and to enable humans to engage profitably in commerce and trade (Casson,2013). The very 
extensive supply chain literature addresses supply chain practices and performance (Swink et al., 2007; Flynn et 
al., 2010), supply chain strategies and their dynamics over time (Ketchen & Giunipero, 2004), and to some 
degree addresses changing supply chain configurations (Halldorsson et al., 2007; Ülkü & Schmidt, 2011), as 
manager strive to improve factory performance, the trouble is that often the meaning is lost (Zeng, 2017), while 
interest in SCM is immense, it is clear that much of the knowledge about SCM resides in narrow functional silos

Abstract 
 
The increasing amount of food waste is perceived as a problem in urgent need of a solution to solve it. In this article, 
the relationship between users in public university and their food waste behaviour is accessed. Besides, this study 
also aims to examine reverse logistics across food waste recycling. The two key factors that had been found that 
affect the food waste behaviour among users in public university are knowledge and experience, and accessibility 
and availability. By using the survey method, a set of questionnaire was distributed to 400 users. In this study, there 
is a significant relationship between knowledge and experience as well as the accessibility and availability of food 
waste behaviour. This study contributed to university management and users in order to have adequate food waste 
management.

1. Introduction 
 
As concern about climate change, environmental responsibility, and sustainability escalates throughout the 
developed world. Reverse logistics is a relatively new business concept, and firms tend to dedicate their assets and 
resources on the forward operations and to overlook reverse logistics, and the value can be generated (Hazen, 2011). 
The significant reverse logistics in the food industry is evident in the requirement to provide quality and safe food to 
consumers without posing any threat to the environment.  Wasted food is a considerable component of the world’s 
food system challenges. Food waste can be described as all edible food materials produced for human consumption 
but left uneaten, either lost or discarded throughout the food supply chain (Haibin,& Chen, 2015). Food waste, on 
the other hand, is the food that is discarded by retailers and consumers, for instance, unsold food that is destroyed by 
a supermarket after they pass their expiry date as well as uneaten food at school buffets. According to FAO (2017), 
approximately one-third of food produced in the world for human consumption is lost and waste globally. The 
amount of loss and waste is about 1.3 billion tonnes per year. Food is lost and wasted throughout the supply chain 
means from the initial production until the household production (Wigmore, 2013).  
 
Malaysia is well-known for its diversity of exotic cuisine, and we are proud of the diversity and tastiness of our 
food. Unfortunately, our familiar foodie environment turning into a culture of waste. According to the Statistics 
from Solid Waste Corporation Management (AlBakri, 2016), every year, an average Malaysian household throws 
away more than one month’s salary on the food they do not eat. The issues of food loss and food waste are 
becoming more and more prevalent as essential matters for leaders to address as Malaysia’s food security becomes a 
national concern increasingly.  Despite the massive amount and complexity of food waste produces, the standard of 
food waste management in Malaysia is still weak. These include outdated documentation and framework of food 
waste generations rates and its composition, inefficient storage and collection system — furthermore, the lack of 
knowledge among users in public university about food waste issues and being ignorant about the effect that 
improper food waste management has lead worsened to the problem. This paper explores insight about the food 
waste behaviour which highlighted a complex inter-relationship between personal factor (knowledge and 
experience), situational factor (accessibility and availability).

for knowledge and experience is less than 0.7 so it is considered as weak. However, the combination of the number 
of items has improved the Cronbach alpha values for an overall unit of measurement.  
 
Correlation analysis was used to examine the occurrence and strength of the relationship between all variables which 
are knowledge and experience, accessibility and availability, and food waste behaviour. Based on table 3, the p-
value for knowledge & experience is 0.000 at which it is less than α value of 0.01. Therefore the study concludes 
that there is a relationship between knowledge & experience and food waste behaviour. H1 which is a significant 
relationship between knowledge & experience and food waste behaviour should not be rejected. A positive 
relationship exists between knowledge & experience and food waste behaviour in which the correlation coefficient 
value, r = 0.541. This means that when knowledge & experience increases, sustainable food waste behaviour also 
increases. Based on table 3, the p-value for accessibility and availability is 0.000 at which it is less than α value of 
0.01. Therefore the study concludes that there is a relationship between accessibility & availability and food waste 
behaviour. H2 which is a significant relationship between accessibility & availability and food waste behaviour 
should not be rejected. A positive relationship exists between accessibility & availability and food waste behaviour 
in which the correlation coefficient value, r = 0.206. This means that when accessibility & availability increases, 
sustainable food waste behaviour also increases.

5. Discussion 
 
Reverse logistics is rarely discussed in recycling waste management (A. Jalil et al., 2016) and primarily focus on 
recapturing values from end-users back to the supply chain (Vlachos, 2014). In this study, it is perceived that women 
(Mainieri et al., 1997; Zalega, 2018) tend to participate in surveys that focus on environmental behaviours (i.e. 
recycling behaviour; waste behaviour; conserving energy behaviour) . This is an important finding because 
according to Schahn & Holzer (1990), they reported that gender as crucial in modifying environment behaviours. 
The objective of this study was twofold: (a) to investigate the relation of a personal factor which is knowledge and 
experience to the food waste behaviour among users in a public university and (b) to investigate the relation of a 
situational factor which is accessibility and availability to the food waste behaviour among users in a public 
university. Correlation analyses supported the hypotheses under study: Specific consumer knowledge and 
experience correlated food waste behaviour as well as accessibility and availability correlated the behaviour with the 
weakest strength in comparison to the latter (Derqui & Fernandez, 2017) which the author suggests that engagement 
among tertiary students are considered necessary to influence the recycling food waste behaviour effectively. A 
practical design of situational factors such as composting pit; secondary food take-back point and organic refuse 
system allow students to be more attentive in refuse their snacks and meals (Karim Ghani et al., 2015). Whereby, the 
study showed a significant correlation between situational factor (accessibility and availability) with food waste 
behaviour (A. Jalil et al., 2016). On the other hand, the personal factors that focus on the end users’ knowledge and 
experience on how to dispose of the food waste after they consume can bring impact to the food waste behaviour. 
The finding showed that there is a strong relationship between knowledge and experience with food waste 
behaviour. This factor exerted the positive relation with significant value on users’ behaviour hence, students likely 
to change their food waste behaviour if they are exposed to positive engagement and reinforcement in the tertiary 
setting (Karim Ghani et al., 2015). According to Derqui and Fernandez in their study, the level of food waste 
knowledge of the tertiary students in university level is still low (2017) due to the low awareness activities that 
provide the right knowledge on organic waste especially food waste. Thus, it is crucial to focus on this factor so that 
it can bring a revolution to tertiary education that focuses on future sustainable behaviour and conservation attitude 
(Abdul Ghafar, 2017).  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The finding of the study generates a clear picture of how the critical factor has a significant relationship with food 
waste behaviour among users. The study has determined the knowledge and experience, as well as accessibility and

availability, are the essential factors when addressing the food waste behaviour of the users. Therefore, the tertiary 
institution should take action in combating food waste behaviour and strengthen the users’ knowledge on sustainable 
behaviour that focuses on sustainable consumption and recycling or refusing sustainably of organic waste. The 
university setting is an example of a significant source for food waste especially the canteens and cafes. Melikoglu 
et al. argued when there are plenty of individuals dining at the same place, it has a significant impact when it comes 
to food waste (2013). Hence, it is essential to promote sustainable behaviour  at the tertiary level.

Abstract 
This research is to study a patient examination operation problem, which contains the patient appointment 
scheduling policy and patients' examination room assignment policy.  The objective of this study is to 
minimize the patient waiting time with constraints of the medical staff workload balance and utilization. 
This research uses a case image center to construct a simulation model of the patient ultrasound examination 
operations in order to examine the performance of different policies in two scenarios.  Based on the 
numerical simulation, the results show that the optimal patient inter-arrival time in Scenario 1 is 18 minutes. 
In Scenario 2, the weighted cumulative examination point policy outperforms the cumulative examination 
point policy, the cumulative examination time policy, and random policy.

Abstract 
Wire rope manufacturing industry in Malaysia is thriving and demands are rising for the products. Productive 
workers are needed to fulfill the work orders however, the existing work stations designs have detrimental effects on 
workers’ health. This is because the productivity level is always linked to the wellbeing of the workers. In response, 
Karakuri Kaizen concept implementations has been selected to improve the current workstation designs.  The 
relationship between Karakuri Kaizen with productivity and ergonomics during the concept implementations is 
studied. A case study on the proposed concept had been performed in a wire rope manufacturing factory by means 
of questionnaire and experiments concerning both previous and improved workstation designs. Validation of the 
results are done by using productivity reports throughout the year, REBA analysis and Paired Samples t-test. Reba 
analysis shows significant improvement from REBA Level 3 and 4 on previous designs to Level 2 after concept 
implementation. Productivity increases around 5.8% throughout the study. Compelling differences between two 
samples have also been recognized through Paired Samples t-test. Therefore, the implementation of Karakuri Kaizen 
concept on the workstation designs has positive impacts on both productivity and ergonomics in wire rope 
manufacturing industry dictated by the results of this study. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
A wire rope maker factory was established in Malaysia in the early 1980s with the aim of developing high quality 
wire rope to be marketed globally. Generally, the manufacturing process can be divided into two major departments. 
The first department will consist of batch pickling, pre-drawing, inline patenting, pickling and coating. Second 
department will comprise of   intermediate drawing, stranding, closing and lastly packaging. Most of the processes 
during rope manufacturing require manual handling by the operators to move heavy bobbins at the workstations and 
around the production floor. Manual Handling involves manual lifting, lowering, carrying, pushing and pulling loads 
and have always being associated with musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) (Deros et al., 2015). Musculoskeletal 
disorders have reduced operator’s productivity and detrimental effects on the health of the workers. Pain and 
discomforts experienced by the workers have been recorded in wrists, arms, neck and back as the aftermath of their 
job specifications.

4. Conclusion  
This study was conducted to identify the relationship between Karakuri Kaizen concept with productivity and 
ergonomics especially at Drawing process workstation in wire rope manufacturing industry. This study also has 
been conducted out in order to achieve the three main objectives which are: to evaluate and analyze the manual 
material handling activity at existing workstation design that effect operator’s productivity and health, to design 
ergonomics workstation by implementing Karakuri Kaizen concept, and to identify the relationship between 
productivity and ergonomics consideration through before and after Karakuri Kaizen concept implementation at 
Drawing process workstation. 
 
Through the study, implementing Karakuri Kaizen concept at workstation design does give impacts on both 
productivity and ergonomics. This study can be as reference for any other manufacturing industries that looking for 
a solution to increase their process productivity and at the same time consider the ergonomics factor to improve their 
worker’s health on the production floor. 
 
During implementation of the study, several areas had been identified to work on the future work which are, 
i. This study can be use as reference but with extend the scope by implementing the concept on other wire rope 
manufacturing processes such as Stranding and Closing process to view the effectiveness as overall. 
ii. Running the same study but evaluate it in term of electric current energy cost saving since through this concept, 
there are no electric motors or sensors involved. Only by using gravitational potential energy and that can be 
considered as a green energy aspect. 
iii. Evaluate the relationship between Karakuri Kaizen concept with other factors such as machine breakdown ratio 
and height of the facilities or worktable and determining the optimum level of these factors that can increase the 
productivity.

Abstract 
Retail industry is the most rapidly changing and dynamic industry in emerging economies like India. Indian 
retail industry is witnessing rapid growth due to vigorous investments, rise of multiformat retail, growing trends 
in e-commerce and m-commerce, and increasing penetration of internet. The growth in the sector is coupled 
with intense competition, shrinking revenues and rising expenditure on promotional activities, drawing attention 
of the decision makers towards efficient operations. It is imperative to develop methodologies for efficiency 
measurement to support planning and implementation of efficient operations. In this study we propose an 
approach for measuring the efficiency of multiple retail stores based on self and peer evaluation using Data 
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology. The study also present comparison between self and peer 
evaluation scores and suggest roadmap for inefficient stores to identify the inputs and outputs to be optimized 
with respect to the nearest efficient benchmark. The validity and application of the proposed approach is 
presented through a case study.

Abstract 
This research study unravels the concept of wastage in the hospitality industry in a holistic view. The overall purpose 
of the research study is to scrutinize and establish what challenges the hospitality industry is facing regarding wastage 
in their establishments and what impact waste has on their environment. The secondary purpose that follows the first 
one is to examine what the current waste management solutions are in the industry and if they are effective in the 
current environmental quandary the industry is facing. The tourism and hospitality industry is one of the largest 
industries of the world. It contributes 10.3 percent to the global gross domestic product (GDP) and it elevates a total 
of 8.7 percent of the unemployment epidemic worldwide by providing 234 million jobs globally. The hospitality 
industry has shown impressive and significant growth levels since the industry began decades ago, which proves to 
have a great positive effect on its economic contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP) not only in South Africa 
but across the globe. This industry creates jobs and generates prosperity worldwide. However this fast growing 
industry with all its positivity also has detrimental effects on the environment and its natural resources which is a 
major concern in a global perspective. The industry uses excessive amounts of natural resources and thus creates a 
detrimental impact on its environment and surroundings. The concerns with hoteliers’ relationship with environmental 
challenges and social responsibility have reached high levels on the public agenda. The Substantial press coverage of 
degradation, high pollution levels and polarization of the environment are increasing every year. The hospitality 
industry is working in partnership with government and private organizations to try and minimize to the very least the 
negative effect pollution and miss use of the natural resources such as energy and water but it is not enough. The 
industry is ever evolving and has established a customer orientated program that makes their guest receive the best 
and freshest product but this has had a direct effect on wastage in a holistic view. Hoteliers have also introduced 
‘greening’ to their daily tasks but this has also proven not to combat wastage in its totality.

In the previous graph food waste was the highest causes of wastage in the hotels and the graph above indicate that in 
the research conducted most waste is incurred during buffets and then staff meals and fine dining and then A la carte 
and room service servings.  
 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion and recommendations 
In the 21st century guests are different and more sophisticated then they have ever been before but there are ways of 
saving even though providing the best service to the guests. Preservation of the natural resource is of uttermost priority 
and concern because wastage of it has detrimental effects for the current generation is for the generations to come. All 
hospitality establishments have a role to play in enforcing all greening practices and environmentally friendly practices 
across the globe in all their establishments. Saving in a holistic view is required in this industry.

Abstract 
Having precisely analyzed the data from patients with specific diseases, we could obtain not only the patterns and 
knowledge of these diseases, but also the specific characteristics of patients. It is usually considered hypotheses 
in medical studies. Then, the data is prospectively collected to prove or deny this hypothesis, but in many cases, 
there may be relationships between patient data, which has not even been conjectured about them, and no 
hypothesis naturally has been considered. Hence, the purpose of this study is to discover the hidden patterns of 
tuberculosis(TB) patients' datasets. According to various assessment indicators of TB, first, the Entropy-Shannon 
method was used to identify the most important features. After discovering the existing association rule of data by 
using the APRIORI technique, the R software was then used to implement these techniques on 548 data of TB 
patients referred. Following this, the results of the Entropy-Shannon method have identified 18 factors. Also, 
the APRIORI algorithm was discovered nine association rules between the highest values of lift and the minimum 
support and confidence value equaled to 0.5 and 0.9, respectively. The results could be considered for further 
studies, particularly clinical trials as a primary hypothesis or apply to analyze patients' clinical status.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, with advances in IT systems, there are the vast sets of patient data and their clinical symptoms. 
Through detailed data analysis of patients with a particular disease, the patterns and rich knowledge of that 
disease or even patients own particular features may be achieved. Medical studies consider a hypothesis, and then 
data is collected prospectively to prove or disprove the hypothesis; however, in most cases, there may be some 
relations between patient data with no speculation. Data mining techniques can be used to discover such patterns 
in data.  Data mining and knowledge discovery in data is an approach to find the hidden patterns and 
relationships of data (Wu et al. 2014). Today, data mining has been used in many medical science studies, including 
Prediction and diagnosis of the diseases (Bhatt et al. 2018), Effectiveness and survival treatments (Rodger 2015), 
Health Management Services, patient relationship management system (Koh and Tan 2011) and the discovery of 
hidden patterns in diseases dataset (Sim et al. 2014). New ideas such as knowledge discovery from database 
including data mining techniques, today, have become more popular and have been transformed into ideal 
research tools for the researchers. Through them, researchers can identify patterns and relationships between lots 
of variables and it is made possible for them to predict the results of a disease using information available in 
databases reserves (Zolbanin et al. 2015). 
Before applying data mining techniques for medical data, researchers must understand what kind of data mining 
algorithms exists and how they function. Generally, data mining algorithms are classified into two categories, 
predictive (or supervised learning) and descriptive (or unsupervised learning) (Yoo et al. 2012). Prediction data 
mining infers prediction models from datasets and has the ability to classify the data. Classification is one of the 
important prediction data mining in which there is a set of records with a field label. In classification, we are looking 
for a model in order to assign an appropriate label to a record with an unknown label (Buczak et al. 2015). While 
descriptive data mining, unlike classification, clusters data by measuring the similarity between objects and 
discovers unknown patterns or relationships in data so that users can readily understand a huge amount of data 
(Banjari et al. 2015). Association rules which is important technique in this field with exploratory in nature, also 
determine the dependencies

were identified. Association rules discovered in this study are established in this data set but they could be used as 
hypotheses for other studies and these relationships could be examined in other studies.  
The signs of TB depend on which member is attacked by the germs. A TB germ usually involves the lungs and the 
symptoms of TB include a bad cough for more than three weeks, chest pain, and hemoptysis. Other symptoms may 
include weakness or fatigue, weight loss, appetite loss, fever, chills and night sweats which sometimes may not be 
accompanied by none of the above symptoms but it can only be diagnosed with lung accidental X-ray and without 
any symptoms (World Health Organization 2015). Even though TB is without cough and pulmonary symptoms and 
only with weight loss, an individual may have some symptoms such as chest pain which is caused and intensified by 
breathing and coughing. By looking at table 3, it is clear that almost all the main symptoms of TB including 
hemoptysis, fever, weight loss and night sweats are also associated with chronic cough. Therefore, if there are such 
symptoms, physicians can diagnose the disease by considering the high possibility of the occurrence of chronic cough 
in the near future for the patient. 
One of the limitations of association rule discovery data mining method is that the discovered rules are established in 
this dataset and these rules may not be established or changed in another data set of TB patients. Thus, it is better to 
combine several databases to achieve reliable association rules. Another limitation of the study is the number of 
patients that were 548 in this study but large amounts of data are typically required for data mining studies. Therefore, 
in our country, medical and hospital information systems must be strengthened and the storage of patient data and 
electronic records must also be paid much more attention because if there aren’t such storage systems for patients' 
clinical data, data mining studies with large volumes of data   are actually impossible. 
The study was conducted on TB patients and since they all had tuberculosis, it was not possible to create data mining 
models based on classification techniques. It is suggested to carry out a study to establish a classification model for 
TB diagnosis among those susceptible to the disease by considering TB patient data as well as data from patients who 
are suspected to have TB but not infected. Also Since the results of a data mining study are difficult to generalize 
because it is done on a particular data set, it is recommended to conduct systematic review and meta-analysis studies, 
in the case of quantitative results, on data mining studies that have been carried out around the world about a disease 
or particular patients so that the overall results could be achieved by analyzing the results of several studies. For 
instance, a systematic review could be designed and implemented on all data mining studies conducted on tuberculosis.

Abstract 
Today healthcare service has offered the modern treatment approach with medical technology. This kind of 
technology has become such a predominant part of healthcare service because no practical diagnosis or treatment 
strategy is possible without using them. The advancement of technology is also driving medical companies with 
great opportunities to take a new innovative product into market. In addition, company could not focus solely on 
large amount of volume and low production cost to keep up growth, however, they have to control its direction 
towards quality trusted for usage. Meanwhile, climate change and pollution is increasingly unprecedented before 
and putting burdensome on this sector, which is lacking behind other sectors, to become sustainable manufacturing 
organization. That is true that medical device industry considers safety, usability and efficacy of product, but 
product design and development is a major role behind these factors. Sustainable design, sometimes called green 
design, has become a globally significance topic but not many works of academic papers are directly targeted to the 
medical device product. Therefore, the purpose of this study is initially conducted to identify influencing factors and 
then determine key improvement recommendation for sustainable development of medical device. Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to prioritize the influencing factors and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is 
used to find the key improvement attributes recommendation. The result of this study shows linear relationship 
between product user and developer towards quality and sustainability of product. It is found that the most of the top 
concerns of device users are not only safe for present use but also recyclability, which product can be made for 
environmental conservation, at the end of its life.

1. Introduction
One of the biggest industries in healthcare sector is the industry of medical device manufacturing. The industry is 
importantly driven by concept of innovation and new systematic discovery. For the last few decades, it has been 
seen that this industry has become an unprecedented growth due to the fact that there are interested investments in 
innovative technology advancement. According to research conducted by Lucintel (2018), the global medical device 
market is expected to reach approximately $410 billion by 2023. The major drivers of growth for this market rely 
upon healthcare expenditure, increasing of health awareness and boom of aging population. The medical device 
technology leads the way of healthcare much stronger than any other forces. Healthcare organization needs it 
necessarily to provide highly safety treatment service to the patients as they need emergency help. Although every 
medical device company probably has different standards level of defining quality product, it is normal sense that 
the high quality product is not simply sure that it is totally defect-free because there are many development 
processes being paid much attention on. As an example, customer value proposition, value creation and value 
capture. Evidently, products recall for medical device has taken place previously. Those products were sent back to 
company or supplier for field correction and repair (Zuckerman et al., 2011). When this kind of problem occurs, it is

that there is no chemical substance that affects product life time and quality of use when it is operated for patient 
treatment. Material reduction: this is how engineers or company owner put discipline for product plan and 
development design. Careful planning makes company reuse scrap or residual and increase material value for finish 
product. Software: medical software is prominent for today technological use in healthcare organization system. 
This disruptive technology helps to improve healthcare service and improve the quality of care. The hardware, 
which is run by software, necessarily need power supply to fuel. Power supply: more than medical device alone, the 
device is equipped with power supply to support operating system run by motor or software and senor detect. 
Hardware: is made of raw material which refines to create tailored shape product. The combination of modularity of 
elements is the fit shape which all functions are operating in the right way at the same time.  Packaging: the product 
packaging is another factor that material selection, will be used, should carefully consider. The light packaging is 
easy to carry or move to envelop main product and raw material reduction can save a lot of money for company. 
More than that, packaging product should be made of raw material that can be disposal or recycle to create new raw 
material for another product. This result, not only beneficial for economic benefit but also environmental health 
which there is no harm to biological life and human health.  Maintenance and toolkit: is the last priority for engineer 
and manufacturer who should make consideration to produce for spare part and product repair when customers need 
those services. This key improvement recommendation will set aside of customer’s dissatisfaction and also improve 
innovation effort as a system in company perspective. The company does not only lift up reputation but also 
officially comply with the law which ensures the prosperous action to the better world.  
 
5. Conclusion  
Business could be created not just only operate what company wants to do but also has to listen and observe both 
inside and outside environment. Product design and development play a central role for business manufacturing 
company.  However, to get all collectively right information among stakeholder requirement and putting in the 
process is the sparkle of success. The product user and developer are two sides of the same coin which could not be 
separated away that this relationship is a bridge to keep business innovation alive. AHP and QFD are the powerful 
tools for user-centered design which can work best together with cross-functional teams; however, they require 
qualified set of experts who are specialized in solving problem. The result of this study shows sustainable perception 
in healthcare industry that they tend to take responsibility for using product which reduce side effect of environment 
and conserve natural resource utilization. On one plus side, the attributes improvement recommendations are the key 
pathway to reach sustainable product development goal, which material selection is a high priority among names 
ranged. Future research will be conducted to develop robust sustainable product design and development framework 
for medical device with case study, yet make interview with whom responses for product procurement and user. 
This research helps turn the light for researchers or the ones who are new in field of healthcare product to take their 
attention and boost their confidence to do further research by taking concept of sustainability.

Abstract 
Developing countries like Pakistan facing the power theft and blackout issues are in severe need of 
making the system automated, reliable and efficient to better of its economy with the advantages of 
system. This could be made possible by the easy installation and highly   reliable   data   communication 
t h r o u g h    smart grids. In our research, RFID devices are employed to work in synchronization with AMI 
meters to make the smart grid efficient and less time communicated. The major problems of power theft and 
severe blackouts are controlled by employing special types of AMI stage 2 types of meters.  The RFID 
unlike wirelessly, here is employed so that the economy levels are sustained. Unfortunately the conventional 
grid being used in developing countries like Pakistan are not much able to cope with the future challenges 
like increasing energy demands and blackouts etc. Conventional grids employ single way communication 
between the supplier and consumer thus restricting supply to one way which in turn limits the feedback and 
timely responses. Energy crisis in a country like Pakistan are happening because of the reasons like inability 
to use hybridization techniques, theft a nd the b ul ky old economy is maintained.  RFID   over   power  
line conventional grid system. The major reasons for such technology  makes  the  two  way  communication 
in  a much better way and reduces the cost of separate conductors. Different types of RFID possibilities and 
ways are analyzed in the research and they are used for power line carrier technology. The proposed system 
has the ability to revolutionize the power line communication technology with the applications such as 
payment, ticketing, tracking and leads to the new emergent technologies.

1. INTRODUCTION
Power grid is traditionally the term used for a power system with interconnection of generation, transmission, efficient 
distribution and power control. In order to accomplish the efficient distribution of utility to load centers or consumers 
the grid should be such that which actively regulates the supply with the needs of consumer thereby keeping the 
reliability, efficiency, economic and controllability at the proper causes are the use of manpower and inefficient old 
system that is too far from the replaceable capacity and also not capable to involve the modern techniques of 
hybridization and power controllability. [1] Thus to make the system more efficient and reliable keeping in view the 
economy we come across the smart grid also known as future grid, intelligent grid, which is a grid of 20th century. 
Smart grid generally employs the two way communication mechanism between the supplier and consumer which results 
in timely responses enabling the power control in a better way. On the other hand smart grid employs the hybridization 
of   more   than   one   resource   thus avoiding the severe blackouts other than the physical damages. 
Smart  grid  controls  all  the  parameters  of  power system by a central location avoiding the theft as no manpower 
is induced and also the bulky old conventional system is avoided which is generally creating many disturbances and 
flaws subjected to climate conditions. The mechanism by which the two way communication is being held is very 
important from the reliability and economical point of view. In this research paper our main focus is on the radio 
frequency identification devices (RFID) in conjunction with smart metering to make the system automated and more 
accurate. This would generally lead to the elimination of theft, reliability, efficiency and also for the betterment of

The RFID communication technology in conjunction with smart metering technology brings about smart grid to a wider 
level of benefits for the economy and prosperity of a country like Pakistan. Thus in order to maintain all this the efficient 
way of communication is brought in line so that it may results in more possibilities. The power theft in a developing 
country like Pakistan and a definite time lag in communication leads to the severe blackouts and uncertainties. Thus to 
make system work in a better way hybridization and smart grid communication are employed.  
 
 
 CONCLUSION 
 
The proposed methodology of RFID based smart grid with A M I  m e t e r i n g  t e c h n i q u e  i s  u s e f u l  f o r  t h e  
country like Pakistan where power theft and severe blackouts are common. To make the region better of the 
economy, reliability and efficiency of the system must be well structured. So this technology improves all  the  
features  as  the  time  required  for communication is very less and also the two way communication is made possible 
through RFID devices  that  can  be  used  for  tracking  or  other purposes.   The   timely   responses   of   
consumer’s demand and usage are managed and also manpower is completely eliminated as the system is surely 
automated remote managed. Only a single person is controlling number of consumers at a particular station. The 
type of meters and devices are selected on the behalf of speed of operation and reliability. All such arrangement of 
system makes the continuous supply o f    energy p o s s i b l e    without   any   serious blackout or problems 
occurring.

Abstract 
The overall purpose of the study was to investigate and establish some of the motivating factors responsible for the 
failure or success of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the Township of Tembisa. A secondary purpose 
that follows on the first one is to establish to what extent management skills and training skills have an influence on 
the success or failure of small businesses in Tembisa. The study identified and outlined the business and management 
skills required for the management of small enterprises in the township of Tembisa. The primary objective of the study 
is to identify those managerial and business skills that have contributed to the success and or survival of small 
enterprises. The population for the study was made up of SMEs in Tembisa, which were identified from the overall 
population of Tembisa Township small business enterprises. The study used a quantitative research method, and 
questionnaires were completed by 160 small business owners in Tembisa Township. The investigation revealed that 
it is important for small business owners to have financial management, marketing, time management, technical and 
interpersonal communication skills to bring success in the business. It was also discovered that small business owners

Figure 4.6 
The graph above indicates that 153 business owners in Tembisa indicated that they strongly agree that interpersonal 
and communications skills and creativity skills were essential when doing business in Tembisa while 7 business 
owners in Tembisa disagreed. 154 business owners strongly agreed that conceptual and decision making skills, 
Technical skills and Time- management skills were essential when doing business in Tembisa while 6 business owners 
disagreed. 152 business owners in Tembisa strongly agreed that entrepreneurial skills and marketing management 
skills were essential when doing business in Tembisa while 8 disagreed 
 
 
5. Conclusion and recommendations 
 
SMEs play a crucial role in boosting the economy of a country and have significant impact on the GPD and yet these 
enterprises still have a high failure rate that is increasing on a yearly basis. Immediate government interventions are 
encouraged and not just interventions of training and teaching SME owners and management but measures of going 
the extra mile and actually doing day-to-day operational visits and implementation of theoretical knowledge leant in 
the classroom into practical day-to-day operational implementations.  
Financial management skills, marketing skills, entrepreneurial skills, time management skills, conceptual and decision 
making skills, technical skills and, creativity skills are some of the critical skills needed to successfully operate a SME 
and therefore more investment must be put in place to ensure that training for SME owners and their management is 
done on to improve skills.

Abstract 
The emphasis on producing graduates with entrepreneurship abilities have heightened in recent times in Nigeria due 
to the persistent decline in public and private job opportunities. This has mounted unprecedented pressure on the 
engineers who were previously thought to be drivers of job creation and technological transformation. Rather than 
confronting the unhealthy job scarcity appreciably, engineering graduates have surprisingly ranked high in the profile 
of job seekers, to the extent of scampering for lean banking and allied jobs, sales and security agents etc. An attempt 
is made in this paper to review engineering education with a view to ascertain the root cause of graduating massive 
job seeking engineers from Nigerian institutions, short of job creators or entrepreneurs, at least. The making of a 
Nigerian engineer is presented in terms of education and training, including the qualification for admission and the 
eventual admission criteria set by government and institutions. The effects of the prevailing factors surrounding 
engineering education are delineated with specific merits and shortfalls. Opportunities for improvement and areas 
needing reforms were suggested. The policy results of the research, if properly implemented, can reposition 
engineering graduates and engineering educators for accelerated job creation in the country as well as embolden the 
self-dependence prospects of engineers. 
Keywords: Engineering Education, Job Creation, Engineering Graduates, entrepreneurship, Self-Dependence

Introduction
Engineering education and its expectations have long relished an advantage point among policymakers and researchers 
concerned with technology development in Nigeria (Ozor and Mbohwa, 2017, Akinyemi, 1987, Eze, 2008). The need 
to reform the curriculum and other emerging trends necessary for administration of engineering education in line with 
global practice has been stressed (Olunloyo, 2002, Adegbuyi and Uhomoibhi, 2008). Advanced economies have 
turned to sustainability and improvement of developed policies while some developing countries have regrettably been 
caught in a web of vicious circle, occasioned by policy summersault, thereby hampering development. Sustainability 
of engineering education has attracted the concern of some researchers and Institutions alike (Staniskis and Katiliute, 
2016, Cristina, 2016). There seems to be a notion that instructional approaches so far evolved can result in self-
employable Engineering graduates in some quarters, but more continuity and streamlining efforts are still needed. 
Evaluation of the place of sustainability and social responsibility (S-SR) domains and identification of some paradigm 
shift in quality system of Engineering Education and European Scientific and Technical Education for Sustainable 
Industry (ESTE-SI) programme, as new objectives and department strategy for efficient planning has been canvassed 
(Staniskis and Katiliute, 2016). The authors used a four step evaluation and reporting technique to assess S-SR 
organization, content of Engineering programmes, Student participation and culture issues as well as research and 
innovation in a selected pilot institute. The presentation underscores the need for a properly defined implementable 
interim and long term results oriented template for sustainability. Cristina (2016) present a glossary of qualities needed 
to make Engineering graduates who are able to motivate, create, and think outside of the box and suggest original 
course of action when promotion of authentic graduate entrepreneurs matter. The authentic engineering entrepreneurs 
should fit into the job description of any Industry in the sphere of the graduates discipline and go further to create jobs 
upon graduation. Results of past research on engineering education in Nigeria show that the graduates are still

transformation in the republic and produce engineering graduates that can drive job creation. It is noteworthy that 
engineers have recorded a general apathy to participation in politics and by extension ceded critical leadership 
positions to graduates from other disciplines, and only wait to be appointed into any office without reason or proper 
discretion. Even offices directly under the purview of engineers are manned by lawyers, take for example, the Nigerian 
Ministeries of Works and housing is Babatunde Fashola-a lawyer. The minister for Labour and Productivity is Dr 
Chris Ngige- a Medical doctor. The storey is same for many state Governors, National and state house of assembly 
members. This ought not to be so. Engineers must strive to occupy decision making positions that can influence every 
facet of the profession, beginning from education or training to real World practice. With this, engineers will be able 
to transcend the prevailing ordinary to become professionals whom others would want to emulate. It could be argued 
that engineers are not capable of being leaders due to paucity of requisite skills, and should be invited whenever there 
is a function to differentiate or integrate. This perception seems correct considering that many graduate engineers 
today lack the soft skills required for effective leadership. Worse still, they (graduate engineers) lack the basic skill to 
become self-reliant and original. If not, why should an engineer be declared unemployable? 
 
4.1 
Updating of engineering education resources 
 
The complaint of poor performance among Nigerian engineers, especially in terms of practical dexterity has been 
lingering for some time. These engineers whose impact per se cannot be felt in the industries has classmates and 
colleagues who returned to become lecturers and laboratory instructors. The implication is that the students being 
thought by the said lecturers has already inherited a gen of non- good practical performance. Like every other that can 
be transferred from parents to offspring, the students will eventually graduate as no-better-than-lecturer engineers. To 
contain this, there must be a sort of training reform that cuts across every player in engineering education. Sufficient 
is the fact that engineering educators had obtained a grounded knowledge and detailed experience in real world aspects 
of engineering theories, policies and global best practices. 
More emphasis should be laid on current status and future dynamics of the practical aspects of the discipline to drive 
not only job creation, but entrepreneurial capabilities that guarantee the engineers realistic independence. The 
educators ought to be subjected to continuous training workshops and short period visits or even training in emerging 
industries. Achieving this will be more possible policy adjustment and agreement between government and industries. 
Industries should be ready to contribute to making of total world class Nigerian engineer as part of cooperate social 
responsibility. Engineering must be treated as a professional course, which it qualifies in intent, theory and practice. 
Medical doctors and pharmacists are well taken care of right from training to practice and students as well as graduates 
from these professions are in no wise better than engineers. A mouth-watering welfare package should be arranged 
for the engineering educators in other to spur better performance. The subsisting practice of treating engineering 
educators in direct disparity with some fellow professional disciplines should be discouraged forthwith. This will not 
only rekindle the ebbing flame of lecturing and arouse the needed interest in the job but also prevent brain drain in 
engineering schools. It will also provide for more efficient teaching and research exercise.  
 
Conclusion 
 
The performance of Nigerian engineering graduates is largely dependent not on the end, but is much of a path process. 
The time to wake up and embrace the deafening challenges to engineering graduates in Nigeria cannot be postponed 
any further. There is no generation of homo-sapiens with a monopoly of intelligence. The difference is mostly on the 
environmental conditions surrounding the nurture of individuals. Towards this, the environment and training path of 
engineers in Nigeria can be re-engineered to provide for graduation of quality world class engineers that will transform 
the country technologically and economically. Qualitative mastery of the tenets of engineering by lecturers and 
students will aid ample job creation and self-employment, as well as inadvertently effect the actualization of the 
change mantra of the federal government.

Abstract 
 The Laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF) is a new, novel &promising tool in the 
diagnosis of diseases. It plays very important role in study of the muscles of the organs of 
different living beings. The LIF spectroscopic is less invasive compared to other methods. It is 
also clear that the study of intrinsic fluorescence spectra would help in differentiating diseased 
tissues from normal ones.  Fluorescence spectroscopy can reveal physical and chemical changes 
in fluorophores.

Assessing the Effects of Sustainability Practices on Product 
Life Cycle- Clustering Approach

Abstract 
Enterprises are under surveillance for their product’s environmental footprints, quality dimensions and production 
system environment. In addition, there is a growing concern of liability for entire product life cycle where firm is 
responsible for consequences caused by product till its useful life. Enterprises are urged to adopt a Triple Bottom 
Line approach of sustainability to respond effectively to the dynamics of Profit, People and Planet. We use LISREL 
based Structural Equation modeling to identify the mediating role of product life cycle in the relationship of 
sustainable practices and firm performance. Based on the findings, Exploratory Factor Analysis is performed to 
identify cluster of sustainable practices for each product life cycle.  The recommended framework can be used by 
practitioners as a decision support tool in exercising sustainable practices in each product life cycle stage.  
Keywords

1. Introduction
Organizations in today’s business context are faced with multiple challenges. Some of the challenges are internal to 
the business environment while some are external (Leonidou et al., 2017). The challenges within organization are 
related to productivity, quality improvement, workmanship and employees’ training. As employees are important 
part of the business, they need to be trained and empowered (Schwartz, 2017; Clarke, 2018). Similarly, external 
pressures are from customers and government. Government legislation enforces liability on employees, customers 
and environment. Considering the role of employees, customers and government, a Triple Bottom Line (TBL/3BL) 
approach is suggested for an environment friendly production, customer driven policy and an employee friendly 
workplace (Ozgun et al., 2015). Moreover, there is a need to initiate sustainability protocols to pay more attention to 
the negative environmental consequences of product in different life cycle stages (Charter et al., 2017). This study 
has two objectives. First, role of adopting sustainable practices according to product life cycle stages is highlighted. 
Structural Equation Modeling is used to quantitatively investigate the mediating effect of Product Life Cycle (PLC) 
stages in the relationship between Sustainable Practices (SP) and Firm Short Term (STP) and Long-Term 
Performance (LTP).  Based on the findings, clustering of SP bundles according to different PLC stages is performed 
using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). Life cycle stages considered for this study are introduction, growth, 
maturity and decline (Anderson et al., 1984).   
Products throughout their life cycle pass through different stages by varying in terms of profit generation, meeting 
social needs, and environmental footprints. Since PLC encompasses all stages of a product, from inception till 
deception, life cycle analysis (LCA) measures the impact of the product’s performance starting from raw material, 
production, repair till the end of life, and recycling. Modern life cycle analysis evolved in 1990s (Dubey et al., 2017) 
and is regulated by ISO 14040 and 14044. Product evolution is a complex phenomenon for an enterprise to apply 
LCA approach due to societal dynamics, environmental uncertainties and imperfections within the business (da Luz 
et al., 2018). In production contexts, LCA has passed through Cradle-to-Grave, Cradle-to-Cradle and Design for 
Manufacturing (DFM). More focus is on End-of-Life (EOL) practices where maximum values are extracted after 
useful life of a product to minimize its negative footprints (Hourneaux et al., 2018). There is a need to adopt PLC 
stages based sustainable practices to enhance corporate social responsibility.  
It is recognized that an enterprise plays a key role in implementing sustainable practices for attaining strategic edge 
(Hamann et al., 2017). Sustainable practices are receiving research attention for the last two decades, especially in 
the context of corporate social responsibility (Marshall et al., 2015). Customer perception drives the social 
responsibility index and enterprises are urged to limit their environmental consequences for a sustainable society 
(Dzikuć, 2015). Sustainability is defined as the creation of products that use processes to minimize negative 
environmental footprints, reduce energy consumption, are safe for workers, societies, costumer and economically

Abstract 
A facility cannot be smoothly operated if not properly maintained. Hence, facility operations and maintenance (O&M) 
function has obtained a noteworthy recognition due to its significant contribution made for the continuous operation 
of a facility, core-business performance and occupant’s satisfaction. However, the diverse nature of facility O&M 
functions necessitates effective supply chains. In particular, the crucial elements engaged in O&M functions such as 
the parties involved, information flows, finance flows and service/product flows have been neglected in previous 
studies. Hence, this study aims to develop a model for supply chain management of facility O&M function in apparel 
sector. Given the importance of apparel manufacturing to Sri Lankan national economy, the study was focused on 
apparel factories. An in-depth literature review followed by case study design under qualitative approach was deployed 
for empirical investigation. The collected data was analysed using manual content analysis and using QSR N-Vivo 
software. According to the case study findings, supply chain management in O&M functions is carried out in ad-hoc 
manner in case study orgnisations. The study developed a SCM process for facility O&M functions incorporating 
three O&M sub processes; i.e. (a) customer relationship management, (b) internal supply chain management, and (c) 
supplier relationship management. The research findings can be used as a guide by the facility O&M teams for 
optimising the performance of O&M supply chain functions.

1. Introduction
Apparel industry had played a principal role in taking off the Sri Lanka’s economic status since it was unleashed and 
liberalized in 1977 (Board of Investment [BOI], 2018). It has become the largest gross export earner since 1986 
accounting for more than 56% of exports and the country’s largest net foreign income earner since 1992 
(Dheerasinghe, 2009). According to Philbrighty (2016), in order to maintain competitive advantage, speed is an 
important parameter in Sri Lankan textile manufacturing. Superseding the history of maintaining 6 months of lead 
time every year, the industry has reached a 6 weeks of lead time in order to meet the fast and reactive fashion models 
(Philbrighty, 2016). Improved maintenance value stream assist in reducing lead time through reduction of downtime 
(Mostafa et al., 2015). Maintenance in manufacturing at a greater degree determines the production quality and 
quantity and has a direct impact on production cost and satisfaction (Al-Turki et al., 2014). According to the authors, 
the role of maintenance in maintaining assets over its life time is becoming more perceptible given the increase 
acquisition of assets and its maintenance costs. The study carried out by Monageng et al. (2018) targeting textile 
manufacturing factory stressed the importance of maintenance in manufacturing textile to fulfil the demand of local 
and international customers.  
Maintenance comprises all work referring to the economic preservation of facilities, systems, and tools at an 
acceptable level to perform their desired functions (Lewis and Payant, 2007). According to Lai and Yik (2007), the 
performance of buildings are based on the good practices on operation and maintenance (O&M) of facilities, which 
comprise of service installations such as air-conditioning, electrical, ﬁre protection, and plumbing and drainage 
installations. O&M of buildings has become critical to the extent that no building could sustain whether old or new in

5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
Facilities operation and maintenance is something unavoidable in current context and especially in apparel 
manufacturing facilities. Starting from the external fabric up to utility services determine the quality of work 
environment and ensures the continuous production process within the facility. For instance a breakdown in 
compressor would hold the entire sewing process and would impact the targeted output. Hence, O&M is paramount 
for apparel factories. Yet, no factories focus on streamlining its supply chain and determining a practicable O&M 
supply chain process. As a result, synergies, which could be gained in the process is neglected. This could be overcome 
by initially determining the O&M supply chain and establishing the supply chain process. This study had made an 
effort in determining both, which would contribute to industrial practitioners in long run. The O&M maintenance 
supply chain is a chain of networks, which is made of internal customers, external customers, internal suppliers and 
external suppliers along with interrelated information flows, finance flows and service/product flows. Further, the 
O&M supply chain involves direct and indirect relationships among multiple parties creating several challenges such 
as improper coordination, not meeting customer requirements, long waiting time, lack of spare parts, and more. In 
order to address such challenges incorporating SCM process is necessary. The developed O&M-SCM process mainly 
comprises three sub process as CRM, ISCM and SRM. In order to ensure the implementation of such sub processes 
several strategies were introduced through the study. The developed O&M supply chain and the O&M-SCM process 
could be utilized by facilities managers, maintenance engineers and other professional engaged in similar disciplines 
to ensure a seamless service delivery to meet end customer requirement and in long term add on to organisational 
profit. This study had made an effort in determining both, which would contribute to industrial practitioners in long 
run. The study will be further developed to establish a performance measurement system to enhance effectiveness and 
efficiency of FM supply chain.

has been highlighted. As revealed from literature, buildings consume approximately 50% of the global energy 
annually, during construction, operation, maintenance and deconstruction stages. Hence a variety of methods are 
followed to minimise the impacts of embodied energy (EE) and operational energy (OE) in buildings. EE impacts of 
buildings are becoming significant with the increased efficiency in OE consumption. Therefore, considering either EE 
or OE in its individuality is not a pragmatic approach. The design stage was identified as the most suitable stage for 
integrating energy efficiency measures, since most crucial project decisions are taken at this stage. Different 
professionals who can impact energy decisions were also identified. Although a multitude of research has been 
conducted on EE and OE individually, there seems a lack of investigations that focus on both these aspects together. 
Therefore, this paper sets out to develop a conceptual framework to optimise the impact of EE and OE in buildings 
during the design stage by reviewing secondary data. The involvement of construction professionals, barriers and 
strategies to optimise the impact of EE and OE are discussed and incorporated to the framework.

1. Introduction
Construction is a large, dynamic and a multifaceted industry which encompasses developing new structures and 
engineering projects (Celik et al., 2017). The construction industry accounts for around 9% of the global Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP), which is indicative of the economic significance of the industry in the global context (Horta 
et al., 2012). However, the positive impacts of the construction industry on economic growth is overshadowed by the 
industry’s negative environmental impacts (Yusof et al., 2017). Being a large industry with wide ranging aspects, 
construction accounts for a significant proportion of the global energy and resource consumption (Basbagill et al., 
2013). The building sector which is a major sub-sector of construction, consumes approximately 48% of the annual 
global energy production throughout the life cycle stages of construction, operation, maintenance and disposition, 
which emphasizes the need for regulating energy consumption associated with the building sector (Dixit, 2017). 
Lifecycle energy consumption of buildings can be divided into two main categories as Embodied Energy (EE) and 
Operational Energy (OE) (Iddon & Firth, 2013). Although the ratio of the general energy consumption breakup of EE 
to OE of buildings is found to be 16:84 (WBCSD) (as cited by Mani & Venkatarama-Reddy, 2012), the significance 
of EE has increased with the development of buildings which are highly efficient in terms of the OE consumption. 
Therefore, Birgisdottir et al. (2017) highlighted that it is important to consider means of reducing both EE and OE in 
parallel and according to Balouktsi and Lützkendorf, (2016), it is a challenge faced by the construction industry at 
present. Therefore, this paper was aimed at developing a conceptual framework to optimise the impact of EE and OE 
in buildings during the design stage by reviewing secondary data.

The requirement for construction professionals involved in the building design stage, to consider energy efficient 
building design concepts is paramount. However, certain barriers were identified which impede the development of 
energy efficient buildings with low embodied and operational energy and these need to be overcome through the 
implementation of enabling measures. Based on these key considerations, a conceptual framework was developed for 
the design of energy efficient buildings with low embodied and operational energy.  
 
9. Conclusions and Way Forward 
 
The limited number of research that focuses on both EE and OE reduction in parallel, bears testimony to the fact that 
achieving simultaneous EE and OE reductions is a difficult endeavour. This paper looks at theoretical aspects and sets 
the foundation for a larger subsequent empirical investigation on determining strategies for achieving simultaneous 
EE and OE reductions during the building design stage. As the next step of the study, the conceptual framework, can 
be used to develop best practice guidelines to achieve simultaneous EE and OE reduction in buildings during the 
design stage.

Customer orientation, Operations Management, Hospitality Operations and Service excellence 
Abstract 
The tourism and hospitality industry is a rapidly growing, fast paced and dynamic industry. The tourism and hospitality 
industry had a major transformation around the nineteen-sixties, when hotels were no longer exclusively found in city 
centres, but saw the development of new locations. This fueled the expansion of the industry. Around the nineteen-
eighties, the industry evolved a strategy centred on the pampering of the guest. 
The industry’s growth has been rapid and fast paced. This growth is continuing today, and, the more the industry 
grows and advances, the more complex their customers/guests become. Service excellence in the tourism and 
hospitality industry has, therefore, advanced tremendously since a decade ago, and guests have also transformed and 
became more sophisticated. They demand customized service; they expect service excellence at all times; and they 
complain much more often than ever before about every possible aspect of their experience. Because of the demand 
from guests, the industry spends much time training staff on service excellence, motivating staff to prioritize guest 
experience, and putting measures in place to make sure that the rules are adhered to and guests are happy with the 
service they receive. The trends in the current experience of hotels includes, for example, staffing kitchens with master 
chefs to stylize the guests’ dining experience at all mealtimes. Therefore, experience has become a key motivator in 
how service is being customized for the guest. 
Key words: hospitality industry, service excellence, customer orientated service.

Figure 4.6 
 
The graph above indicates that 59 per cent of the guests visiting hotels in the Johannesburg North region are frequent 
travellers and this gives us an insight that these guests are amongst the ones that have loyalty membership with 
particular hotels in the region of Johannesburg North. 25 per cent are the ones that travel 11 – to 30 times a year. 8 per 
cent are the guests that travel 31 – 50 times a year and 7 per cent are the guests that less often that everyone mentioned.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. 
Conclusion  
 
Companies in the tourism and hospitality industry have become customer oriented to meet the demands and 
expectations of their beloved customers. According to Angelo and Vladimir (2011:18) the companies in the hospitality 
industry have an obligation to deliver on the promise they make to customers, owners and its employees. There have 
been many theories and ideas about service delivery to guests but implementation of these theories remains a 
challenge. Guests today are demanding and difficult and expect value for the money they pay. 
Angelo and Vladimir (2011:16) further mentions that successful hospitality companies focus a great deal of 
management attention on establishing quality standards for services, communicating these standards to their 
employees through training programs and measure performance and guests feedback. 
 
Guests of the 21st century have evident or significant difference to the guests from a decade ago when the industry 
started. The difference in these guests is clear and visible by their requirements, behaviors, expectations and overall 
likes and dislikes and hoteliers are to take heed and educate themselves on such matters so to please and keep their 
guests and in the long run maintain them on their side and not captured and swept away by their ever trying competitor.

Abstract 
In recent times, the South African bakery industry has gone under intense competition that threatens 
the survival of players within the sector. An identified bakery firm located in the City of Tshwane 
is not immune to the problem. Faced with fierce competition from established bakery firms such as 
Albany, Sasko, Supreme, Blue Ribbon and retail own brands such as Shoprite, Spar and Pick n Pay, 
the bakery firm urgently need to rethink its strategy to secure its survival. An assessment of total 
quality management (TQM) on the operations of the bakery firm is a recommended strategy for 
continuous improvement and gaining a competitive edge. It is therefore important in this study to 
understand employees’ perceptions of total quality management and establish its impact on 
operational performance. For the sake of bringing this study into operation, the researcher utilised a 
descriptive research design. Data was collected through a well-structured questionnaire from a 
sample of 110 employees working for the bakery firm. Analyses of data that include mean values, 
standard deviation, correlation and regression analyses was performed through the use of the 
Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Results showed that employees had a negative perception 
on total quality management factors that include leadership, knowledge management, supplier 
management, customer focus, employee involvement and process management. A significant 
positive relationship was also found between total quality management (leadership, knowledge 
management, supplier management, customer focus, employee involvement and process 
management) and operational performance. This study also provides recommendations to authorities 
within the bakery industry so as to improve total quality management and operational performances

Stress is considered as coercion from a domain rather than internal individual strain. The widely acclaimed definition 
in modern times is a definition which relates to the manner in which individuals interact with situations. Stress refers 
to the psycho-physical state that occurs when an individual’s resources are insufficient to adapt to the requests and 
pressures of their circumstance. Subsequently, stress is situational and individual phenomenon probable in particular 
circumstances than others and in particular people than others. Stress can impede the accomplishment of objectives, for 
individuals as well as organisations (Michie, 2002). Stress is a typical reaction to everyday occasions in the work 
environment. However, inadequate communication lead to increased stress levels due to superfluous concern and worry 
over genuine or perceived issues of the workplace. The inability to foresee future outcomes due to a lack of 
communication can result into increased stress levels. 
 
2.4.6 Mistakes 
 
Most employee errors originate from lack of comprehension, as opposed to the act of consciously making mistakes. 
Insufficient understanding arises from inadequate communication. When an employee does not comprehend 
instructions, they are likely to perform their task inaccurately even when they have been given logical, clear and concise 
instruction. Instead of being too petrified to ask, employees should be motivated to pose questions to their supervisors 
in cases where they do not comprehend something. Asking questions opens up paths of communication and aid in 
preventing misunderstandings of expected duties. Similarly, employees lacking effective communication skills are less 
likely to request for assistance and clarification. Inadequate communication leads to misconceptions often leading to 
mistakes.  
 
2.5 Causes of ineffective communication (Barriers) 
 
Barriers to communication can arise at all the stages of the communication process (comprised of sender, receiver, 
encoding, message, decoding, channel and feedback). Communication barriers have the capacity to create confusion 
and misunderstanding. 
 
 
3-Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
During the study it was established that certain areas provide opportunities for further research: 
Due to the important role external stakeholders’ play in determining service delivery successes in organisations and 
related companies, it is proposed that a study be undertaken on eMIS system, to understand the benefits and dis-benefits 
that the system has for the organisations and for the community they are servicing. It is recommended that a study be 
undertaken to investigate policies on employee motivation with an aim to improve performance and productivity. The 
language used in existing policies to be reviewed as well, to ensure common understanding by all. 
 
Conclusion 
 
 
The study found that, there are several barriers to communication in organisations and related companies. This paper 
revealed that employees of the same level share similar challenges however on the other hand challenges on each level 
differ. Employees are also not fully aware of what the other levels are experiencing due to different working 
environments they are exposed to. Therefore,  
 Stakeholders (internal and external) play a significant role to determine if communication is effective or not. Also, it 
was noticed that, there are always challenges in organisations but employees are not aware that their challenges are 
results of gaps in communication.

Abstract 
Impact of location factors in building construction cost is increasing over past decades in all over the world. It draws 
the attention towards the concept of analysing the impact of location factors to determine how to estimate the 
building construction cost with a high level of accuracy to prevent client's money from unexpected fluctuations and 
provide most suitable design within client's budget. Even though location index is considered in most countries, Sri 
Lanka has failed to use it and still uses single cost index considering only the time factor where location index is 
vital. This necessitates the development of a holistic analysis on impact of location factors approach to the 
construction sector in Sri Lanka. Preliminary questionnaire survey validated and modified the location factors 
identified in literature review. Further, it is established the most significant factors based on respondents' comments 
towards impact on construction cost in building construction. Moreover, percentages of major cost elements in total 
construction cost were recognized as material (40%), labor (24%), plant and equipment (9%), preliminaries (10%), 
overheads and profit (17%). Detailed survey focused on prioritization of location factors with AHP tool for major 
cost elements of building construction; ground condition and climate are identified as most significant impact 
factors.

Building Construction Cost, Location, Sri Lanka 
1. Introduction
Estimate is the net projected cost of implementing the work for a given project. It reflects all items of 
expenditure which are required to accomplish the work (MacBain, 2014). In construction industry, it is a 
forecast of the measure of a project considering accessible information at the season of expectation 
(Sitsabo, 2012). A main measure of success in making budget estimates is forecasting the outturn capital 
cost and the whole life cost precisely at project inception (Samphaongoen, 2009). Contractors want to be 
confident that the estimates which form the substance of their tenders are realistic and if their tender 
prices are unswervingly high, they will fail to attract work and on the other hand if their prices are too 
low, they will get work at unprofitable rates (Statewide Program Management Group, 2008). 
Factors such as construction site condition, complexity of the project, market rate, project schedule, 
quality of plans and regulatory requirement, location, type and size of the project influence the 
construction cost estimate and substantially impact the project cost (Cartlidge, 2013). Hence, the cost of 
developing or obtaining individual project elements differs not just over time, but also across 
geographical areas (Abeysinghe, 2010). For example, in the UK, tender price is differed based on the 
region of the country where the work is performed; normally, London and the South East of England 
being expensive; the area variations are shown in a location index that is used to adjust prices 
(Samphaongoen, 2009). Therefore, variances in prices between cost analysis data and cost plan are 
adjusted using some indices namely, building cost indices, location indices and tender price indices. 
These are achieved using index numbers stating relative to a base year (Cartlidge, 2013).

major cost element of relevant location factor. ‘Overall Rank’ was prioritized by referring overall 
performance scores. The overall performance score of each location factor integrated to cost elements 
were added together and total performance score for each location factor is obtained which is depicted in 
Figure 1. 
 
According to the total performance score, “ground condition” has the highest impact on the building cost 
when the location changes, while the “infrastructure” in the vicinity got the lowest impact.  
5. Discussion 
 
Generally, location factors impacting on the building construction cost in Sri Lanka are distance from 
Colombo, availability and price of material, availability and wage of labors, legal issues, ground 
condition, local market condition, infrastructure and climate. The process of demarcating the impact of 
each factor on each cost element is complex and specific factors contribute to the other categories. To 
overcome these issues a hierarchical structure was developed. Accordingly, highest percentage of the 
building cost will be obtained by material which is 40%. Others, labor, plant and equipment, preliminaries 
and overheads and profit cover 24%, 9%, 10% and 17% of building construction cost respectively. 
Therefore, ultimate success in construction cost can be achieved by more concern on the ‘material’ 
category.  
 
According to Figure 1 ‘Ground condition’, ‘Climate’, ‘Local market condition’, ‘Availability and price of 
material’, ‘Legal issues’ and ‘Availability and wages of labor’ have respectively obtained the highest total 
performance scores exceeding 0.05 and Distance from Colombo (0.044) obtained the performance score 
very closer to the 0.05. Therefore, the aforesaid location factors can be identified as the most significant 
factors to impact on building construction cost. ‘Ground condition’ is approximately sixteen times greater 
than the least significant factor which is ‘Infrastructure’. It shows the criticality of the highest significant 
factor when comparing with the least significant factor. 
 
In conclusion, a mechanism to quantify the critical factors that effect on construction cost has been 
developed in this study. The process is directed through three core steps, 
1. Identification of major cost elements of a building and location factors affecting 
construction cost of a building  
Figure 1: Overall performance scores of location factors

2. Structuring the location factors hierarchically (Allocation of each location factor to each 
cost element based on their impact) 
3. Defining percentage impact of cost elements to building construction cost based on the 
region 
4. Quantify the effect of the factors on construction cost using AHP tool  
a. Develop the weights for each cost element  
b. Develop the ratings for each location factor for each cost element 
c. Calculate the weighted average rating for each location factor and derive the 
indices  
 
Accordingly, indices can be developed to adjust the cost estimates of buildings or changes in the location. 
This can endow with benefits to cost estimators by providing accurate and reasonable construction cost 
for the achievement of a fair value to the client’s money.  It is expected that the key location factors 
identified in this study improve the understandings of industry practitioners in impact of location factors 
on building construction cost. Analysis are conducted in own customized ways. Therefore, it cannot be 
expected a consistency among the location factor analysis in various buildings. In that case, 
implementation of developed scores in each location will allow making comparisons among locations and 
further find out the impact of the eight location factors on cost.

Abstract 
The competitiveness of industry needs a quality of their human resources. People aspect in organization always treats 
as an object which should follow the rules that has made. In another fact, peoples or employee are the object that 
should need waiting for the treatment. The most important thing in service industry is human capital. Therefore, to 
achieve with more efficient and effectively, organization needs the competence person to do any kind of function. By 
competency profiling, all of factors comes from board of management should be clear and can be translated as a 
business driver and corporate values. In terms of creating basic direction for human capital development, the company 
tries to change all attributes in static to be a competency attribute to catch up the competitiveness. By create in internal 
initiative and describe all of the core competences aspects, it has driven the corporate to develop of competency 
profiling. This modeling based on their   design in a concept from the ethos of work, it   mentioned   as P I N T A R 
concept, and described into their mapping of core competencies by using the theory of Excellent Performance of 
Malcolm Balridge. This mapping process has been made as a concrete policy which should be implemented in field. 
So the goal for management is to focus attention on competencies that really affect competitive advantage. This paper 
used the methodology with description analysis to ensure the approach process can be related to the basic concept and 
elaborated to the theory based. It had designed for the company which has services as a third party logistics. Currently, 
the concept has embedded as part of company culture and philosophy to encourage their employee.

1. Background
The level of competition in the industry requires the quality of its human resources. In the criteria of success, many 
companies measure the numbers and budget because this is considered an indicator as tangible evidence. On a number 
of occasions it can be seen also how many companies strive for success by applying the application of standard 
management theory that is considered to influence processes, products, costs and much more However, it is often 
undeniable that there is one factor that is always left behind and is considered as the last part of the reform process, 
namely the human resource factor. The role of humans in organizations is considered an object that must follow the

5. Conclusion 
 
In general, the results of the analysis and processing of data obtained provide interrelated relationships with 
each other both from the initial preparation of the vision and eg the company, mapping core competencies, 
identifying individual competencies and the performance to be achieved by the company. Some conclusions 
that can be given are: 
1. That the level of competition in the increasingly tight logistics industry causes every company to be able 
to develop adaptive and competent human resource capabilities based on the company's understanding and 
competitive advantage. 
2. Core competency identification provides direction for individual development in order to balance the 
company's pace in business competition based on its goals and vision and mission. 
3. That a strong foundation is needed in translating core competencies through an implementation 
mechanism that is easily absorbed and carried out as a life view and work orientation basis. Uniqueness 
and specificity in outlining core competencies will create creativity and excellence for companies in 
addressing industrial competition. 
4. Thus, identifying the core competencies of the company is creating a basic framework for individual 
development that is based on individual internal conditions such as understanding the business knowledge 
carried out, skills in planning strategies and orientation to customers. These innovative motives will make 
it easy for individuals to develop and be moved to constantly improve their business performance.

Abstract 
Advance in machine learning techniques for machine condition monitoring is now an active field of interest in 
modern industry for predicting the future health of machines. In this paper, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) 
technique is investigated by using the existing datasets of ball bearing fault to classify the fault location and severity. 
To enhance the accuracy, the utilization of statistical features and spectral features are used in pre-processing with 
the proposed method of cascade ANNs. Motor vibration data is collected by using accelerometers attached to the 
housing in the drive end and fan end. To diagnose the faults in the rolling bearing, the vibration data is pre-
processing by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and other statistical features such as standard deviation, skewness 
and kurtosis etc. Then the feature data is fed into cascade ANN_1 and ANN_2 to classify the fault location and 
severity. The objective of this research is to solve the problem of poor features such as slippage frequency 
component in FFT response and inappropriate statistical feature datasets to help increase in accuracy and efficiency. 
The results show that the proposed method gives more accuracy when the poor features are existed and guarantee 
the accuracy near to 100%.

1. Introduction
Machine fault detection and diagnosis play an important role in real world applications for predicting or monitoring 
the health condition of machines in modern industry. Generally, machine faults can be occurred in anytime of 
operation. The chance of faults in bearings is the most frequently occurrence by approximately 51% of all failures 
(Kang et al. 2015). The bearing faults detection and diagnosis is also a challenging topic for many researchers to 
study the pattern of the fault signals. Many researches use vibration signal and acoustic emission (AE) collected 
from accelerometer sensors and microphone sensors respectively attached in the housing of the machine. 
Most researches use vibration signal rather than acoustic emission. However, when the machine run in low speed the 
vibration signal seems to be ineffective because the small vibration fault generates signal in small magnitude and 
hard to classify by conventional methods (Widodo et al. 2009). Thus, the use of AE as input to the next 
classification process for machine faults running at low speed is mentioned in (Islam et al., 2017).      
Feature extraction process are classified into time domain (TD) method and frequency domain (FD) 
method. Features extraction in TD as in (M. M. Tahir et al. 2017) used 10 statistical features to reduce undesired 
impact of fluctuations on the vibration signal. In addition, the use of Laplace wavelet analysis for TD vibration 
signal for feature extraction is introduced in (Al-Raheem and Abdul-Karem 2010). A study on three types of ANNs 
namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) network, and probabilistic neural network (PNN) 
along with the selection of input features, are optimized using genetic algorithms (GA) for the TD vibration signal is 
presented in (B. Samanta et al. 2004). Furthermore, simple statistical features such as standard deviation, skewness, 
kurtosis etc. of the TD vibration signal segments along with peaks of the signal are used as features to the input of 
ANN and Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Discreet Wavelet Transform (DWT) prior to feature extraction 
process (Commander Sunil Tyagi 2008) and (O.R. Seryasat et al. 2014).

4.2 Fault severity classification 
 
The vibration data of seeded fault element is brought to classify in different crack size diameters namely             
0.007, 0.014 and 0.021 inches. We perform the same experiment as in fault location cases mentioned above.        
Figure 8 a), 8 b) and 8 c) shows the results of severity of three different scheme. 
For severity test, Figure 8 a) shows that the statistical features can be used for classification the crack size 
0.014 inches which its accuracy more than 70% but the accuracy results are unclear in crack size 0.007 and 0.021 
inches. Better results, from the spectral features and hybrid features are shown in Figure 8 b) and 8 c) respectively 
with 100% accuracy. Notice that the statistical features cannot give a good result for localization and severity 
classification. This is because the spectrum frequency of the location cases: IR, BA and OR has the normalized 
amplitudes around 0.5 at the normalized frequency as shown in Figure 9 a), which is the same as severity cases 
shown in Figure 9 b). The statistical features cannot be classified effectively in this situation because the amplitude 
is nearly the same value.

5. Conclusion 
  
The proposed cascade neural networks for bearing faults detection and diagnosis can be used to classify the location 
and severity of faults effectively. The use of statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, root mean square, 
skewness and kurtosis to the FFT signal cannot give a good result in both location and severity classification 
because the FFT amplitudes are almost equal around normalized frequency at 0.5. The proposed cascade ANNs 
method has its contribution in the case where the systems have poor features and these features cannot be recognized 
effectively in the next classification process (ANN_1). In such case, we use the cascade neural network 2 (ANN_2) 
to help dominate with the good features. Especially, in the case where we do not know when the poor features exist. 
This proposed method guarantees the solution output of the neural networks to be accurate near 100%. In addition,  
it is a simplified method for general machine fault detection and diagnosis.     
 
6. Future Works 
 
In future works of this research, we may play attention to the optimization algorithms of learning process, new 
statistical features or new feature extraction process such as parallel neural networks, convolution neural networks, 
etc. Furthermore, we may use sound signal (acoustic emission) in the future research instead of vibration signal as      
it is rarely studied in this fields.

ABSTRACT 
     It is more than a decade that EVM as one of the most essential principles of the science of project 
management, has given up its place to the newfangled method of ""Earned Schedule"", because of its 
deficiencies in showing the behaviour of projects. A method which in comparison with the previous 
methods, has the needed capability to concentrate on the topic ""time"" without analysing the actual cost 
and solved the problems of the schedule performance  index. However, the continual use of the 
method Earned Schedule showed that although its indexes in use have been efficient in the condition 
of projects, in spite of the basic expectation, the issue of forecasting the future is still one of the 
obsessions of the stakeholders. In this article, based on the identifying the defects of ES method in 
forecasting the future of the project, a new method named as "" Forecasting at completion""  has been 
introduced which is being shown as FC. This method has introduced new parameters to managers and 
the results of using it show that it is more practical than the previous methods.  
Key words 
Project management- S-Curve- Forecasting at completion- EVM- ES- SPI (t) - SPI - Regression Analysis 
1. INTRODUCTION
        Since at the time of delays, the stakeholders criticize the project managers as soon as possible, these people 
try to consider the five-pieces process of standard PMBOK in initiating process and planning process the project 
and use them as tools which can decrease the probability of crisis occurrence in project the most. It cannot be 
denied though that the nonexistence of stability in global economy conditions has increased the effect of 
external factors on projects and consequently has made experiencing such situations inevitable. Therefore in the 
recent years the importance of reports of performance has been depleted and the reports that forecast the future 
conditions will be noticed twice as important. 
      Maybe the innovation of the Earned Schedule and expanding its use can be considered as the result of 
needing such reports. Notwithstanding, the consequence of using this method in various projects and comparing 
it with gathered documents at the end of the project, has changed our attitude toward the quality of the achieved

weekly reports, there has been a less noticeable progress compared with the planned progress. This is while the 
IEAC(t) index, instead of forecasting risks before the projects, considering the conditions of reporting day 
compared to the planned progress, has presented promising repots by mistake. This mistake in reporting would 
lead to delayed awareness of the managers from the critical conditions of the execution (AT=150) and as a result 
the project would face a delay.  While, provided that the report of forecasting the duration of the project was 
presented at the point of AT=77, the IEAC(R) would report the amount 277, which was more than the initial 
(PD=243). The following figure is displaying the comparison of reports which these two methods have 
presented in similar dates.   
 
 
Figure 7- Comparing ES and FC methods in project No. 3 
 
7. Conclusion 
    In this project, after analyzing ""Earned Value"" method, we have concluded that although this method has 
shown a much better performance than ""Earned Value Management"" in estimating the project duration, 
analyzing the completed projects proved that the total dependency of this method on schedule performance 
index, and its ignoring the performance that actual progress curve has shown from the beginning till the 
reporting time, has made a distance between the forecasts and realities. In this project after confirming the 
analysis performance of ES method against EVM, we recognized and solved its deficiencies. Ultimately, we 
introduced a new method with the title of FC which could enable the managers in presenting more appropriate 
forecasts for future. Implementing this method in three projects with different conditions in performance of 
actual progress, displayed that the new index (IEAC(R)) gives better results in comparison with (IEAC (t)). 
Therefore aside with the deficiency of the mentioned index, it is suggested that in order to forecast the future 
conditions of the projects, FC method replaces ES method.

Abstract 
Classification of bandwidth-heavy Internet traffic is important for network administrators to throttle network of 
heavy bandwidth traffic applications. Statistical methods have been previously proposed as promising method to 
identify Internet traffic based on their statistical features. The selection of statistical features still plays an important 
role in accurate and timely classification although most feature selection algorithms consider the correlation between 
features. In this work, we propose a technique based on features characters and Principal Components Analysis 
(PCA) feature selection algorithms for online Peer-to-Peer (P2P) traffic detection. Using Naïve Bayes and J48 
machine learning techniques for available traces from University of Brescia and University of Cambridge, 
experimental results show that the proposed method is able to achieve up to 99.5% accuracy for 0.007 second testing 
time. These results are superior to other existing approaches in term of accuracy and testing time.

1. Introduction
Improvements in computing and communication nowadays bring to society tremendous benefits. Today, peer-to-
peer (P2P) is considered as a standard architecture for sharing a wide range of various medias throughout the 
Internet. The high volume of P2P traffic is due to file sharing, video streaming, online gaming and other activities 
that client-server architecture cannot accomplish as fast or as efficient as the P2P architecture. P2P traffic represents 
27% to 55%  of the aggregate internet traffic, depending on geographic location [1]. The tremendous amount of P2P 
traffic and its rapid progression throughout the years have resulted in deteriorated network performance and 
congestion due to the high bandwidth consumption of P2P applications[2]. Therefore, traffic identification is 
required to improve the network performance.  
First generations of P2P application traffic were relatively easy to be identified due to the use of port-based 
technique. However, current P2P applications are able to circumvent port-based identification by using dynamic port 
numbers or port masquerading. Besides, methods that rely on inspecting application payload signatures have also 
been proposed [3, 4]. Nevertheless, more P2P protocols support payload encryption. The frequency of which P2P 
protocols are introduced and/or improved renders packet payload analysis is not only impractical but also inefficient. 
Moreover, some privacy laws may not allow administrators to inspect traffic payload. The diminished effectiveness 
of the port-based and payload-based techniques motivates the use of flow statistics for traffic identification. These

Table 5.3 shows the results comparison between the proposed approach and work proposed in [7, 8]. The works in 
[7, 8]  used ten Cambridge  datasets and Naïve Bayes to evaluate the feature selection algorithms named (BFS) and 
SOF in order. Our proposed method improves accuracy up to 8.57% and 1.79% in order for Naïve Bayes, whilst, 
shows the smallest testing time compared  with works proposed in [7, 8]. This improvement is results of reducing 
the number of features for our system as well as all selected features can be applied online. 
6. Conclusion 
Classification of bandwidth heavy Internet traffic is important for network administrators to throttle the network 
from heavy bandwidth traffic applications. Statistical methods have been proposed as promising method to identify 
internet traffic based on their statistical features. The selection of statistical features plays an important role in the 
classification results. In this paper, we proposed a subset of features for online P2P traffic classification. The 
experimental results indicate that our proposed online features result in an improved accuracy and uses smaller 
detection time.

Abstract 
The concept of Diffusion of Innovation outlines the transmission of innovatory solutions in different fields and among 
its key components social systems and communication channels act in the effective dissemination of novice solutions. 
Thus, Opinion Leaders are required to be identified within a social system where interconnectivity among the actors 
imply the nature of the Social Network for effective dissemination of innovative solutions. Under this context, it is 
essential to understand the Opinion leadership, their relationship with adopter categories in relation of diffusion of 
innovation, communication channels, threshold of adoption and the methods by which an opinion leader could be 
identified in a social system. A comprehensive literature review is conducted to review and analyze opinion leadership 
and its attributes in relation to effective dissemination of innovative solutions. The research findings elaborate on the 
characteristics of opinion leadership and their identification methods and the involvement of organizational opinion 
leaders in innovation diffusion. The findings of this review would be beneficial for those researchers who are attentive 
in identifying opinion leaders and their influence in social networks and related fields.

consequently climax the characteristics of a cluster and narrate them to social actions along with consequences 
(Lozares, Verd, Cruz, & Barranco, 2014). However as explicated by Rogers (2003) homophily could be an unseen 
barricade in the dissemination of innovation within a social system which would lead on the fact that Change Agents 
should cooperate numerous Opinion Leaders. Nevertheless, more heterophily within a network could only utilize 
lesser number of Opinion Leaders near the top in socioeconomic status and innovative by the Change Agents Rogers 
(2003). In respect to the above fact Turnbull & Meenaghan (1980) documented information streamed from the mass 
media to persuasive within the community and that these influential or Opinion Leader were a significant impact for 
more submissive groups of the people.

A change agent is an individual who influences clients’ innovation-decisions in a direction deemed desirable by a 
change agency Rogers (2003). Furthermore, Turnbull and Meenaghan (1980) stated the two-step flow of 
communications or word-of-mouth advertising is based on the concept that certain persuasive persons in a community 
form an additional area in the procedure in which information flows from the Change Agent through these Opinion 
Leader to the mass audience. Thus, the Figure 2 represents the concept of two flow of communication where the 
Opinion Leader act in the intermediate position of the communication flow influencing a mass group to adhere on a 
specific innovation.

Ozorhon et al. )2010( within their research briefly elaborated on the aspects which enable an organization to 
revolutionize as “drivers of innovation”, in which contribution to the promotion of innovation inside the firm are 
identified as “enablers of innovation” and the “barriers to uptake the innovation are the factors” are the facts that 
considered as impairments for the acceptance of innovation. With the competitive economy in order to upsurge in the 
top most position along with objective to endure the advancement of the organizations constant innovation is required

of notion of OL would inspire informal peer influence and other relationships within the organization. Further Lam 
and Schaubroeck )2000( emphasized Organizational Opinion Leader enforce a greater influence on the fellow 
employees when change or uncertainty arises within an organization to engage as a vital character in organizational 
sharing of knowledge )Smith, 2005(. Throughout modification stage, Organizational Opinion Leader could involve as 
a Change Agent even in the dispersion to motivate the change factor )Armenakis & Fredenberger, 1997(. 
10. Conclusion 
Within the concept Diffusion of Innovation process, the position of Opinion Leader is identified who also identified 
as an early adopter. Subsequently, Opinion Leader’S characteristics, position on adopter categories and the modes of 
identifying them highlighted the usability of the Opinion Leaders as effective personnel in the dissemination of 
innovation. Their behaviour of an opinion Leader in a social system is prominent indicating that their recognition 
leading towards the adherence of innovative solutions to the whole system. Thus, it could be concluded that their 
conduct portrays on the higher social interactions through informal communication procedures with the required 
competency level to lead others on novice practices.

Abstract 
This paper deals with the problem of having a service by solid waste collection sites for surrounding solid waste 
producers, in such a way that waste-induced disaster risk faced by the waste producers is relatively equal. To cope 
with the problem, a location mathematical model of which objective is minimizing the gap between maximum and 
minimum value of waste-induced disaster risk experienced by the waste producers is proposed in the paper. The 
model applicability is subsequently demonstrated by using a problem of having such a relatively fair service taking 
place in the autonomous Regency of Klaten, Central Java, Indonesia. From the application to 2015 problem context 
in the regency, it is concluded that Klaten Regency should build 32 solid waste collection sites in order to minimize 
the gap between maximum and minimum value of waste-induced disaster risk experienced by its 101 solid waste 
producers. The application of the same model to projected 2022 problem context in the same region, in the 
meantime, shows that having a minimum gap between maximum and minimum value of waste-induced disaster risk 
for the 101 solid waste producers can be obtained by establishing 33 solid waste collection sites. In general, it is 
conclusive that an equity-based positioning of solid waste collection sites for an equitable waste-induced disaster 
risk is possible to achieve. 
Keywords 
Equity, Location-allocation model, Site positioning, Solid waste, Waste-induced disaster risk. 
1. Motivation
Equality is an issue of which importance grows over time. This includes equality on being exposed to 
disasters. This is especially crucial for people living in disaster-prone areas. It is generally accepted that waste is 
capable of becoming disastrous once it is not maintained well. Bad waste management results in severe problems 
such as landslide (Defu et al., 2013), disturbance to microhydro power station (Parlan, 2013) and harmful impacts to 
land resources and environment (Wang et al., 2010), to name a few.  
In many countries, the existence of solid waste collection sites – to which residents in surrounding areas have 
to send solid waste they produce and from which the waste is subsequently transported to final waste disposal sites – 
is not new. It is also well known that people do not want to reside close to waste sites, a phenomenon known as 
NIMBY (not in my backyard) syndrome (see, for instance, Crozier and Hajzler, 2010; Feldman and Turner, 2010; 
Feldman and Turner, 2014; Wu et al., 2014). All of these facts lead to the need of positioning shared waste facilities 
relatively equally. This is even more important in the presence of a drastically growing solid waste production, a 
circumstance occurring in many places around the world. 
People concerned with waste-caused problems are already familiar with operations research techniques and 
methods in aiding the management of waste. In particular, the use of location models in waste operation context is 
abundant (see, for instance, Erkut et al., 2008; Ghiani et al., 2012; Ojha et al., 2007; Korucu et al., 2013; Korucu and 
Karademir, 2014). It is clear from previous paragraphs that having waste facilities with relatively equal services to 
their users is of importance. Location models of p-center or p-dispersion, in the meantime, particularly aims at 
getting solutions with fairness for all parties. The search by the authors, however, found that the use of p-center 
models as well as p-dispersion ones on the positioning of waste facilities is not many (see, for instance, Maharani, 
2018, and Brylian, 2018). This paper proposes a combination of p-center and p-dispersion models which is expected 
to give a configuration of solid waste collection sites in a region with relatively equal waste-induced disaster risk for 
all solid waste producers in the region.

From the experiment, it is revealed that, in year 2015, Klaten Regency should provide 32 solid waste 
collection sites with a total capacity of 441 m3 in order to be able to serve its 101 solid waste producers with a total 
waste volume of 440.6 m3, resulting in a minimum gap of 12073.8 m3-minutes. The application of the same model 
to projected 2022 problem context in the same region, in the meantime, shows that having a gap of 13398.5 m3-
minutes for the 101 solid waste producers with a total waste volume of 458 m3 can be obtained by establishing 33 
solid waste collection sites with a total capacity of 458 m3.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The paper deals with proposing an equity-based positioning of solid waste collection sites for the purpose of 
having such positioning with an equitable waste-induced disaster risk taken as the main consideration. It is shown in 
the paper that such site positioning is possible to achieve.

Abstract 
According to statistics, thousands of people are killed and injured on roads. The Philippines is ranked 116th in the 
world out of 183 countries for having the highest death rate caused by road traffic accidents. This kind of issue has 
to be discussed for this involves the lives of people. The researchers have conducted their preliminary study by 
researching through existing studies that discuss the reasons for the problems to occur. The researchers have 
identified the main cause of the problem to occur among drivers through literature reviews which also happens to 
be the possible primary cause of road accidents in Metro Manila is driver recognition error, which includes driver 
inattention, internal and external distractions, and inadequate surveillance. But to further identify the main causes or 
factors for these problems to occur, the researchers conducted a survey through the distribution of questionnaires. 
The respondents of the survey are licensed drivers in Metro Manila. At the end of the study, the researchers have 
used several tools to identify the factors that are significant for the problems to occur. Anxiety, motivation, and 
sleep were the factors that affect attention level among drivers. The researchers have recommended designing a 
predictive model which will help prevent or reduce road accidents in Metro Manila. With that in mind, together 
with the results of the study, the researchers are compelled to make recommendations in order to improve driving 
situations here in Metro Manila.

1. Introduction
Road accidents happen on a daily basis and road safety will always be an important issue to be addressed since 
human well-being is at stake when road safety is not carefully evaluated and considered. Meticulous assessment of 
drivers must be done in order to ensure that public roads are as safe as possible for everyone. Moreover, a great 
responsibility lies in the hands of the people who operate motor vehicles in public roads as the cognitive state 
(attention) of the driver has been recognized as an important aspect in improving safety in vehicles since errors are 
by-products of the human cognitive function (Sena, 2013). 
Based on the World Health Organization report of the year 2017, deaths caused by road traffic accidents in the 
Philippines reached 10,767, translating to an age-adjusted death rate of 11.82 per 100,000 persons and ranking the 
Philippines one hundred sixteenth (116th) out of one hundred eighty-three (183) countries globally. The driving task 
requires the full attention of the driver, and a significant percentage of road accidents happen because of driver error. 
The Metro Manila Accident Recording and Analysis System (MMARAS) reported in the year 2016 that driver error 
constitutes ninety-eight percent (98%) of the total number of accidents attributed to human error under road traffic 
accident causations. However, driver error on its own is still a very broad concept, which is why the National 
Highway and Traffic Safety Administration of the United States further classified driver error as recognition errors,

The regression equation is the generated model after running multiple regression analysis. It shows the different 
ratios of different variables (i.e. anxiety, motivation, and sleep) to its corresponding response variable (i.e. 
attention). This is a predictive model of attention to determine the (attention score and unit) responding to the 
different data behavior of the given independent variables using the assessment used in this study. Using the Minitab 
17 statistical software, the equation is shown below. 
𝑌𝑌 (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴) = 530.6 −3.68 𝑋𝑋1 (𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴) + 3.505 𝑋𝑋3 (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑛𝑛) + 12.33 𝑋𝑋15 (𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆) 
 
5. Conclusions 
Based on the statistical tests applied by the researchers, the sample data is normal, having a p-value of 0.399, which 
is greater than the alpha level of 0.05. The multiple regression analysis results show that anxiety (p-value = 0.035), 
motivation (p-value = 0.000), and sleep (p-value = 0.000) are the factors that are statistically significant to driver 
attention. Moreover, the low r-squared value obtained does not indicate that the model produced by the multiple 
regression analysis is not a good fit for the data. It is normal for fields that study and aim to predict human behavior 
to obtain r-squared values less than 50% because of the differences between personalities in individuals. 
 
This study led the researchers to conclude that the assessment of the factors significant to driver attention could be 
the starting point in improving driver stimuli recognition in order to reduce the risk of road accidents in the 
Philippines. Assessment of the different factors found to be statistically significant to driver attention is important 
because driving skill is not the sole predicting factor in identifying which drivers have a high probability of being 
involved in road accidents. In the Philippines where driving conditions are frustrating, to say the least, consideration 
of the factors included in this study contributes to ensuring safety in Philippine roads. 
 
 
6. Recommendations  
The following significant factors (1) sleep - attention, (2) motivation – attention, and (3) anxiety – attention needs to 
be addressed in order to increase the attention level and the driving performance. Moreover, the researchers are 
recommending the following:

Abstract 
Low back pain (LBP) is one of the health problems among the elderly's in the Philippines such as functional 
mobility, daily living activities, sleep quality, psychological symptoms and reduced health-related quality 
of life. Different research survey questions were used to determine the factors affecting the lower back pain 
of the elderly Filipinos. The aim to help the elderly, researchers identified several factors that greatly 
contribute to having low back pain (LBP). The researchers used the tool Minitab 18 to get the desired results 
of the gathered data, the statistical tool to analyze data’s relationship to other variables, the reliability of the 
dependent variable to the factors. The data was analyzed through ordinal logistic regression through 
normality test. Data gathered showed a normal distribution with a p-value of 0.057. According to the 
analysis, the sleep disorder is most likely the main predictor affecting the lower back part of the elderly 
body. The recommendations provided to this study is to help elderly people to keep a good physical health 
condition, sleep quality improvement and having a regular daily exercise also, things to avoid to reduce the 
risk of having low back pain.

1. Introduction
In the Philippines, the Commission on Population (POPCOM) states that in the year 2017, the aging population (ages 
60 and above) is forecasted to be steadily increasing by (0.23%) or almost eight million elderly Filipinos by the year 
2018 (ABS-CBN News, 2018). As people get old, there will be an increase of low back pain (LBP) complaints leading 
to nerve damage, work disability, depression and insomnia resulting to a range in medical cost of  PhP 21,197.00 to 
PhP 103,225.00 per visit. Additionally, it is the fifth most frequent causes with an account of approximately three 
percent (3%) of the patients are referred to the emergency department (ED) (Jorgensen, 2007). According to the 
medical data provided in a healthcare facility in the Philippines, inactive lifestyle, overweight, incorrect posture, 
traumatic injuries, smoking, and muscle strains greatly contributes to the existence of low back pain among the elderly 
patients. 
In addition, low back pain (LBP) shows to be a major health problem among the aging people because of its high 
prevalence and adverse effects on functional mobility, daily living activities, sleep quality, psychological symptoms 
and reduced health-related quality of life. Elderly people with low back pain (LBP) experiences adversity in mending 
the pain that causes them to limit their movement. Moreover, pain control is one of the many complications in the 
elderly, by many unresolved problems (e.g., difficulty of diagnosis, substantial lack of clinical studies, and a total lack

Abstract: 
Social media (SM) has rapidly evolved over the years to become a dominant platform used globally by millions of 
users for a variety of applications. In contrast, health problems, in particular, obesity have worsened over recent 
years. The literature review undertaken in this study has revealed that obesity remains one of the significant health 
issues globally. Also, despite the widespread use of SM among the population in developing countries, such as 
Sudan, the use of technology interventions to mitigate adverse health habits remains in its infancy. Likewise, there 
are limited theoretical models which lead towards the intention to use SM such as Facebook to address these sorts of 
problems. Therefore, this study proposes a model for the intention to use Facebook as the most popular platform in 
Sudan to mitigate the problem of obesity with particular emphasis on investigating the important factors that lead to 
the intention to use Facebook for dieting among middle-aged Sudanese women. In this study, a framework model 
was developed by hybridising the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Health Beliefs Model (HBM) which 
included factors that could predict preventive health behaviours from the HBM, namely; perceived susceptibility, 
perceived seriousness, and perceived threat. This also included the factors related to the TPB such as attitude, 
perceived behavioural control and subjective norms. This research study is a progress paper that contributes to the 
body of knowledge in this domain, in particular, obesity. While the framework model has not been tested, it is 
proposed that future research is undertaken to empirically investigate the proposed model by using smart PLS3 for 
further analysis.

1. Introduction
The prevalence of obesity as standard fat accumulation (WHO 2006) has been increasing over the past five decades 
(Sturm & Hattori, 2013). The statistics regarding the number of obese and overweight people in the world is rapidly 
growing, and becoming one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality (Ligibel et al., 2014). Several medical 
researchers have shown that individuals who are obese have a much higher risk of developing obesity-related 
diseases, such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, hypertension, stroke, liver and gallbladder diseases 
(Ajie & Chapman-Novakofski, 2014). Also, obese individuals often face psychological threats from society 
becoming hugely stigmatised and are often thought to be “lazy, unmotivated, lacking in self-discipline, less 
competent (Hunger & Major, 2015; Schmalz & Colistra, 2016; Spahlholz, Baer, König, Riedel‐Heller, & Luck‐
Sikorski, 2016). In the workplace scenario, healthcare expenses relating to obese individuals are much higher 
compared to other employees given their chronic conditions which require the frequent utilisation of health care 
services (Ahmadi, Rezaiee, & Hashemian, 2014; Flaherty, 2014). While the obesity phenomena has fast become a 
major public health threat, it has also been observed that the use of social media (SM) has fast become a powerful 
and dominant communication tool of the 21st century (Yakasai & Jusoh, 2015).  
Scientific research directed towards the benefits and competitive advantages of using SM in the health domain has 
generally been undertaken using a theoretical model (Dahl, Hales, & Turner-McGrievy, 2016; Gruver et al., 2016). 
While, other studies have instead pursued a descriptive approach or by performing content analysis (Harris, 
Moreland-Russell, Tabak, Ruhr, & Maier, 2014). However, most of this research has been limited towards focussing

Abstract 
At the current moment, the whole world is talking about the implementation of the fourth industrial revolution and the 
impact it will have on everyone including businesses, the government, academic fraternity and the general population 
at large. Academics and businesses are working on finding a road map for implementing this new phenomenon. 
However, it is of paramount importance to understand that organizational knowledge needs to remain in the 
organisation. Therefore, the question is how can SMEs manage the organizational knowledge in the 4th Industrial era? 
This question is posed because many things will change because of the 4IR. This is a qualitative approach where 
numerous articles were reviewed and a framework was proposed. It was discovered that despite a number of challenges 
that SMEs are encountering in developing countries such as lack of finance, lack of skilled employees and key 
employees leaving the organisation, they will have to be participants in the 4IR era. This study is original because 
there is limited research in the adoption of the 4IR in SMEs and managing knowledge during the 4IR era. Further 
research must be done on the technological techniques that can be used by SMEs to managing knowledge.

1. Introduction
It is a fact that to this current date the world has witnessed three industrial revolutionaries known as industry 1.0, 
industry 2.0 and industry 3.0.  At the current moment, the whole world is talking about the fourth industrial revolution 
and it is at its infancy phase. The Germans are the ones who first introduced the fourth industrial revolution in 2011 
at the Hannover fair in Germany [12]. It is important to understand that after Germany has introduced their strategy 
of automating, digitalisation and the use of robotics countries wanted to be part of that strategy. This German’s strategy 
is known as the fourth industrial revolution (4IR). There were countries such as United States of America, Canada, 
Denmark, France, and China amongst others who were the first to follow the strategy. However, 4IR is a new strategy, 
which academics, policy makers, executives and the industry are still grappling with. They are still looking to find a 
road map so that the industry can actively participate in this strategy. This fourth industrial revolution elements are as 
follows: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Internet of Things, Advanced Manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing, 
Augmented reality, Simulation, Cloud computing and Cyber security. However, not all of these elements are key to 
4IR. Only a subtle of the elements of 4IR drive this German’s strategy (digitalisation and automation). The drivers of 
this strategy (4IR) are as follows: Artificial Intelligence and Big Data [2]. 
As much as the concept of automating and digitalisation sounds interesting to most developed countries and big 
organisations, there are Small businesses that will be challenged by this especially in emerging markets and developing 
markets. SMEs contributes significantly into our GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in developing countries and

However, other elements have been alluded in this study are as are the blocks that enterprises should be aware of. 
When enterprises know potential blocks to sharing knowledge, they must try to avoid the identified blocks. After 
avoiding potential blocks of sharing knowledge, enterprises must work on the model for sharing knowledge. Ensuring 
that employees trust each other, they work well with each other, they are motivated to share their knowledge, they get 
the necessary support they deserve from their management and lastly, they must have the required technology so that 
they may have the necessary technology and be able to take part in sharing knowledge and learning. 
 
6.  Conclusions  
Knowledge sharing is crucial because it helps improve the innovativeness, competitiveness and profitability of the 
entity. SMEs play a pivotal role in the growth of the economy of the country. However, they encounter numerous 
challenges that need to be addressed urgently so that the above mentioned SMEs can be able to reach their maximum 
potential. Moreover, as we are in the infancy phase of the fourth industrial revolution that is driven by Big Data and 
Artificial Intelligence. As these latest advanced technologies will change the way things are done, SMEs must also 
find a way to manage organisational knowledge in the fourth industrial revolution. Barriers for sharing organisational 
knowledge are explored in this study. It is alluded in this research that in order for organisational knowledge sharing 
to take place there must be trust between employees, employees must be motivated to share their knowledge, 
management must also support its employees with regards to sharing organisational knowledge, employees must work 
with each other, information technology must also be available. All the above will contribute in ensuring that 
knowledge is shared successfully in the organisation in the fourth industrial era. This study is limited to SMEs in 
developing nations (South Africa, Malaysia and India). Moreover, this study did not look at the technologies that can 
be used when successfully trying to share organisational knowledge. Further research must be done on the exact 
technologies that can be used to when sharing organisational knowledge in SMEs.

Abstract 
Textile industry plays important role in our country's economy. Handloom weaving sector is one of the most 
important sectors, have the potential to produce employment. However, this sector is ignored in terms of 
development. Due to lack of development in this field, the workers were forced to use traditional methods and 
equipment for their task, which was time consuming and hard work. Workers suffered a lot of health problems due 
to the practice of traditional techniques of weaving. This leads to loss of interest by workers in this field and their 
migration to other areas of work. It also seriously affects the socio-economic conditions of rural people. Besides, 
directly or indirectly it does affect the economy. It is also very time-consuming task. So, an ergonomic and technical 
improvement was important for upgrading traditional weaving. This work identified the issues with traditional 
weaving process of  Maheshwar handloom sector and propose solution provide a better working condition to the 
workers involved in the Maheshwar handloom weaving sector. Further, the work also focuses to provide a viable 
and feasible solution to reduce ergonomic risk factors and satisfy workers of Maheshwar handloom weaving sector 
by earn profit and also increase productivity and provide efficient work.

1. Introduction
Musculoskeletal problems are often related to the handloom weaving process. Design deficiencies often led to many 
problems to the workers and can be seen in the form of bodily pains, Absenteeism, bodily discomfort and job 
turnover. Bodily pains and discomfort tends to be Aggravated by the tasks performed in poor design workstation. 
(Eklund, J. A., 1995). In India excess of 38 million people were utilized in the Handloom weaving area. All through 
the nation and 15,000 local Handloom weaving businesses had been set up in a condition of north and southern parts 
of India. The greater parts of them had a place with low strata of society and were very poor, working in little 
families. Over 40% of weavers were women (Narzary, J., 2013). When modern machines for weaving captured the 
market, handloom market greatly affected and it disturb the Handloom weaver’s life. Due to poor workstation 
design, constrain posture, high muscle exertion and repetitive nature of the weaving task handloom weavers of 
Ahemdabad reported body pains (Nag, A., Vyas, H., & Nag, P. K., 2010). One other study reported that handloom 
weaving process involve repetitive task which was causing pain in the upper limbs among the male handloom 
weavers of West Bengal, India (Banerjee P. & Gangopadhyay S., 2003). 
Maheshwar Handloom owe their name to Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar, the leader of the territory of Indore in the late 
eighteenth century. Maheshwar is a small town in khargone locals of MP State in India where whole study of 
Handloom was done. The weaving business of Maheshwar gave work to around 5000 individuals. Maheshwar 
Handloom Weaver got paid 800-1500 INR to work done by them weekly (Ansari T. M, 2016). It was observed that 
Maheshwar Handloom has same conditions as most parts of the country, their many areas needs to improve and 
update. Most weavers are facing many problems like health, safety, bad environment, and low wages issue.  
A SWOT analysis of Maheshwar Handloom shown in below.

5. Discussion 
Each weaver who was working on the loom complaining about the legs pains and issues related to other body parts. 
Weaver normally worked for 6-7 hours if they work at factory site or workstations. From Direct observation touch 
point led design direction to distribute this work to both feet to make it more comfortable and easy to operate by 
both feet. If it was possible to reduce the standard time so more productivity could be achieved. Also if travelled 
distance of legs decreased than it was more comfortable for weaver. 
6. Conceptualization 
It was found that during shedding step repetitive motion on paddle cause leg muscle pain due to continuous strain 
and load on foot as weaver need to put same energy to continue the process. To solve this complex problem found 
during our study and also from the design direction gathered through the other similar previous study done on the 
handloom suggested design attachment of additional part (Hani U., Das A., 2017) Flywheel was selected to 
overcome this problem where it was connected with the help of push rod which decrease the amount of energy 
applied. Other identified problem was the application of force done by only one foot during the shedding step. Here, 
we applied distribution of load using treadle mechanism. Final concept was prepared after analysing both the 
concepts and integrated them for better performance. 
7. Conclusion 
This study showed that Maheshwar Handcraft sector needed lots of ergonomics intervention. Many people were still 
working in bad condition which caused them health, safety, and financial issues. Initial testing was qualitative, 
importantly the proposed working solution was able to satisfy simulate subject’s more than previous working 
process in discomfort and pain response categories. It could be used in actual working conditions. Design solution 
was portable, low cost and even easy to build with locally available materials, those factors made them more 
acceptable by the Maheshwar weavers. More work can be done in this direction for the device as it cause less 
trouble during the whole process. Still modifications were required.

Abstract 
Nowadays, one of the objectives of fleet management is to reduce fleet size and costs and to improve efficiency at the 
level of assignment, scheduling, and routing. In this paper, we present a literature review focusing on solution methods 
by analyzing 245 journal papers dealing with exact methods as well as heuristics and metaheuristics to solve large 
instances of two main problems in this area, namely the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and the Multi Depot Vehicle 
Scheduling Problem (MDVSP). 
Keywords 
Fleet management, VRP, MDVSP, heuristics, metaheuristics. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Fleet management often includes apart from the management of vehicles, the management of drivers as well. Its
optimization allows improving the productivity of a company. Transportation professionals have to reduce their costs 
while, satisfying all kinds of constraints such as scheduling, capacity, time windows, maintenance, regulation, service 
level, quality constraints. In this review, we are interested in vehicle scheduling and routing problems, with the 
objective of optimizing the assignment of resources to routes and to control fleet size, according to several criteria. 
A wide volume of research work in this area focus on the vehicle scheduling and routing problems at the same 
time. This article is a review of the literature published between 2010 and 2018 on VRP, and the literature published 
between 2015 and 2018 on MDVSP. It is presented in such a way that it specifies the variant of the problem that is 
studied as well as the solution method that is used.

Others* contains other solutions methods not often used, such as a Customized heuristic algorithm; Simulation-based 
evaluation method; a Multi-cut L-shaped based algorithm; a Clonal selection algorithm; exact algorithm based on the 
trip-chain-oriented set-partitioning;  a Partition algorithm; Differential evolution algorithms ; and others metaheuristic 
algorithm. 
We notice that the column generation method is the most used for solving scheduling problems, which is normal 
because this method solves effectively large linear optimization problems like most variants of the MDVSP; but 
generates the phenomenon of degeneracy, which must be combated with other methods.

5. CONCLUSION 
In the present time, transportation management has become increasingly important, especially when we take into 
consideration the increase in demography and human development, which generate high demands. Therefore, plants 
implantations have become exponential to meet these demands, making logistics management difficult in terms of 
supply, shipping, and transportation of personnel; as there are several modes of transportation, this management 
becomes much more complicated to manage. In our paper, we are interested in the VRP and MDVSP, because they 
have a common objective which is to reduce the fleet size and then to reduce the costs. The objective of this literature 
review is to give an idea about the solution methods that have been used to tackle such problems in recent papers in 
this area.

Abstract 
PT. Nutech Pundi Arta is a company engaged in automotive interior industry. This company deals directly with 
some suppliers on hardboard material. During this companies often experience problems related to the 
performance of suppliers such as delivery delays and quality mismatches that have been agreed by the company. 
Assessment of supplier performance is important to do in PT. NPA so that supplier performance can be 
controlled and improved so it does'nt disrupt the continuity  of the company's production. The purpose of this 
research is to identify and determine the weight of criteria and subcriteria of supplier performance and to get 
supplier performance rating using Analytic Network Process (ANP) method. The result of the criteria weight 
were quality (0.20402), cost (0.15984), delivery (0.20764), flexibility (0.13405), responsiveness (0.15272). The 
result of subcriteria weight were the amount  of Goods Reject (0.10741), Provide Guarantee (0.09663), Price 
Comparable to Quality (0.08226), Payment Method (0.07757), Accuracy of Delivery Schedule (0.10348), 
Accuracy of Goods Sent (0.10415), Change of Order Volume (0.07058), Change of Delivery Time (0.06347), 
Response Speed to Complaint (0.07947), Ease of Contact (0.07324). The results of performance assessment of 
hardboard material suppliers that  obtained from the highest order to the lowest are  PT. RMA (0.050053), PT. A 
(0.047198), PT. GCI (0.04444).

1. Introduction
Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a complete relationship of activities starting from the procurement of 
goods and services by suppliers (suppliers), converting raw materials into goods in process and manufactured 
goods, distribution to wholesalers, to arrived at retailers and consumers. In the supply chain concept, suppliers 
are one of the most important parts and influence the survival of a factory. A healthy and efficient company 
does not mean much if the supplier is not able to produce raw materials that are of high quality or unable to 
meet the delivery on time. If the supplier is not responsible and the response to the fulfillment of the request is 
not good, it will cause problems with the continuity of the company's production. Therefore companies need to 
evaluate suppliers carefully and sustainably (Mauidzoh and Zabidi, 2007). 
PT. Nutech Pundi Arta is one of the companies engaged in manufacturing. The products produced are requests 
from customers in the form of car interior products such as hardboards, carpets, plastic silencers and felto. PT. 
NPA has three suppliers that supply hardboard material. The problems found in the three suppliers are 
incompatibility of material specifications provided by suppliers with specifications set by the company. This can 
hamper the smooth production at PT. NPA. Companies in producing production need to get a smooth supply of 
material so that the performance of suppliers needs to be assessed. Continuity of cooperation with suppliers 
depends on the assessment of supplier performance. So far, the company does not have a performance appraisal 
system for its suppliers so that the company cannot determine suppliers that really have the best performance 
and suppliers that have less optimal performance. 
In assessing supplier performance, influential factors not only involve company data, but performance criteria 
must be set. Supplier performance is assessed based on multicriteria QCDFR (Quality, Cost, Delivery, 
Flexibility, Responsiveness). Some decision-making methods (multi criteria decision making) include the AHP 
(Analytic Hierarchy Process) method, the Promethee method (Preference Ranking Organization Method for 
Enrichment Evaluation) and ANP method. AHP method can solve the problem complex multicriteria into a 
hierarchy (Kholil et al. 2015) Promethee method is a method of determining sequence (priority) in multicriteria

Based on the results above, it can be seen that the limiting weight is the weight obtained from the 
supermatrix limit while the normalized by cluster weight is the local weight or the division between the 
weight limiting element and the number of limiting elements in one component. The biggest weight is the 
sub-number of reject items with global weight of 0.107413 or 10.74%. The weights for each alternative can 
be seen in Table 8 below.

Based on the results above, it can be seen that there are weights in the form of ideals, raw, and normal. 
Normal weight is the result of alternative weights such as in the normalized by cluster priority weights. Raw 
weight is the result of alternative weights such as the weight limiting priority or limit matrix. Ideal weights 
are bobo obtained from the division between normal weights for each alternative with the greatest normal 
weight among these alternatives. These results indicate that PT. RMA gets the highest weight, which is 
0.3533, followed by PT. A amounting to 0.3331 and third place, namely PT. GCI is 0.3136. So, in evaluating 
the performance of suppliers for hardboard materials of PT. RPA is the most optimal supplier. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of data processing and analysis carried out by the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method 
in terms of supplier performance appraisal, it can be concluded that: 
1. Quality criteria value is 0.2040 with sub-criteria value of reject (Q1) items of 0.1074 and provide a 
guarantee of 0.0966, Cost criteria value is 0.1598 with subcriteria value comparable price with quality of 
0.0822 and payment method of 0.0775, Delivery criteria value is 0.2076 with sub-criteria for the accuracy 
of the number of items sent at 0.10415 and delivery schedule of 0.10348, Flexibility criteria value is 
0.1340 with subcriteria changes in order volume of 0.0705 and subcriteria changes in delivery time of 
0.0635, Responsiveness criteria value of 0.1527 with the values of sub-criteria for response to complaints

were 0.0794 and the ease of contacting was 0.0732. This shows that the quality criteria have the greatest 
influence on supplier performance appraisal. 
2. Hardboard material suppliers that have the most optimal performance are PT. RMA with a global value of 
0.050053, followed by PT. A with a value of 0.047198 and the lowest is PT. GCI is 0.04444. 
 
6. Suggestion 
Based on the results of the analysis and conclusions above, the researcher advised the company and related 
parties, namely: 
1. Measurement of supplier performance carried out by PT. Nutech Pundi Artha can still be maintained as a 
partner of the company especially as a supplier of hardboard materials at PT. NPA. The results of this 
supplier's performance assessment should be informed to the supplier as a performance report in order to 
establish openness and it is expected that the supplier can maintain and improve its performance, it would 
be better if it is implemented in making the Company Operational Standards or Work Instructions in 
supplier evaluation. 
2. For companies in the future, if there are new criteria or sub-criteria relevant to the company or in 
accordance with the new company policy, then the company can replace the criteria and subcriteria used in 
this study.

Abstract 
The uncertainty of the production system arises in the form of production system disturbances. PT ABC is a 
company that produces heavy equipment components. Based on preliminary research, it is known that there is a 
need to solve the problems of production planning  and inventory control (PPIC) in the company related to the 
disturbances of the production systems faced by the company. The purpose of this study is to map the production 
system disturbances and provide solution to improve the function of PPIC in facing the disturbances of the 
production system at PT ABC. Based on the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) of PPIC, we do mapping of 
production system disturbances occurs. Next, the data processing and analysis are carried out descriptively and by 
using the Classification Technique - Association Rules. The disturbances mapping results show that the high 
severity disturbances associated with the MRP PPIC Model, with the type of disturbances of raw materials having a 
high impact on KPI. The production process cannot run according to planning and scheduling because the flow of 
information that is less integrated between divisions causes each division to process based on their respective 
policies. The company needs an improvement in the MRP system in releasing production and ordering of materials, 
and also control the disturbances of the production system.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Related to the production system, uncertainty is categorized into two groups, namely environmental uncertainty and
uncertainty associated with the production process (Mula et.al., 2006). The uncertainty of the production system
arises in the form of production system disruptions. The existence of a disruption of the production system causes a
deviation (variance) between the planning and the actual conditions that will cause inefficiencies and inhibit the
achievement of the company's targets so as to reduce productivity in the company.
Production Planning and Inventory Control (PPIC) is one of the main activities in a production system. The aim of 
PPIC is to plan and control production inputs in an industry as efficiently as possible to produce production output in 
accordance with market demand. Medium-term PPIC system - short consists of several subsystems or sub-functions 
including Demand Management, Master Production Scheduling, Rough Capacity Planning, Raw Material 
Requirement Planning, Distribution Resource Planning and Final Assembly Scheduling (Fogarty, 1991). 
Conventional PPIC models are unable to adjust flexibly to anticipate and control the complexity and disturbances of 
production systems in the industry. 
To improve the functions of the Production Planning and Inventory Control (PPIC) in the food industry, a smart and 
adaptive PPIC model has been developed to improve the effectiveness of the PPIC function. The PPIC model adapts 
to the disturbances of the production system that occurs with the provision of safety stock which changes 
periodically in accordance with the disturbances of production systems that occur (Marie, 2011). Next, a study on 
the use of the Disturbances Control Model consisting of the Disturbances Control Action sub-model, the 
Disturbances Control Advanced Policy sub-model, and the Inventory Tolerance sub-model which can update the 
value of safety supplies of raw materials and finished products in bread producing companies. The related model has 
been applied to other food companies producing beef sausages. The company has difficulty in determining safety

Heavy equipment component industry with a make to order strategy and engineer to order with company 
characteristics that highly prioritize customer satisfaction while minimizing customer complaints, it is very potential 
to experience an external production system disturbances (demand change).  The industry has specific markets and 
are limited by market trends and also has customized demand characteristics, large product variants with not large 
quantities per variant, limited special market users, high quality raw material requirements, requiring sufficient raw 
material procurement lead times and big investment in raw materials , requires technology and high-skilled 
workforce to produce high-quality products. Characteristics of the industry cause the heavy equipment component 
industry need safety stock for raw material and safety lead time for component that can be adjusted based on the 
dynamics and disturbances that occur. 
 
Based on a pattern obtained from the production system disturbances mapping by using the association rules method 
a priori algorithm, we know that the high severity disturbances associated with the MRP PPIC Model, with the type 
of disturbances of raw materials having a high impact on KPI, the company need Material Requirement Planning 
(MRP) which is supported by excellent information system design, with a good database management system, 
integrated and facilitates the flow of information and communication between PPIC support divisions, simple, 
flexible so that it is easy to adjust and has supporting functions: 
a. To find out the needs and availability of capacity of each production work station. 
b. To find out the needs and availability of raw materials. 
c. To find out the needs and availability of labor. 
d. To browse and find out the order fulfillment status. 
e. To find out if there is a disturbances in the production system and do action of controlling the 
disturbances that occurs. 
 
6. Conclusions and Future Research 
The results of the mapping disturbance analysis at PT ABC show that the production process cannot run in 
accordance with the planning and scheduling that has been made because of the misinformation that also has an 
impact on KPI achievement. Information flow and information flow and material flow that are the input and output 
of the company's MRP system do not match what happens on the production floor. The occurrence of a chain of 
disturbances is caused by a lack of integrated information between divisions and suppliers, so that each division 
processes based on their respective policies and information systems need to be built regarding MRP functions with 
integrated databases between each PPIC division where each department related to PPIC functions has access 
according to their needs. The company needs an improvement in the MRP system and Standard Operation Procedure 
(SOP) for each division in releasing production and ordering of materials. The company also requires an information 
system in the form of a dashboard that can display real conditions on the production floor as well as the status of 
each agreed order, while monitoring the disturbances of the production system that occurs, so that it can 
immediately control and make adjustments so as to meet the KPI of each PPIC division.  Regarding the disturbances 
of production systems that occur, companies can control the disturbances of the production system that occurs by 
providing safety stock for raw materials and finished products in order to support the smooth running of business 
processes and fulfillment of KPIs for each PPIC division in the company.  
 
For the future research, we recommend to apply the disturbance control model,  as has been done in previous studies 
in the automotive industry, starting with mapping the production system disturbances in accordance with the 
relevant KPI, then by utilizing the classification technique approach we got the disturbances control model consists 
of sub-model of the risk level of the disturbance, sub-model of action status, sub- model action control of the 
disturbance, and sub-model of determining the safety stock to assist the automotive company in taking the decision 
to perform the disturbances control action in production system (Marie, 2017).

Abstract 
The major cause of failure in land administration systems in many countries is poor management and lack of good 
governance. Hence, the paper examines previous literature on the impact of property right on low cost housing. The 
study is conducted with reference to existing theoretical literature review, published and unpublished research by other 
researchers. One of the primary findings emanating from the study reveals that enhanced political voice and political 
accountability has an impact on improving the prospects for secure property rights. Furthermore if the governments 
of developing countries provide real property ownership with clear titles and rights enforceable by law, then poor 
people will be able to use their assets to obtain credit which can be employed in productive activities, and countries 
could lever themselves and their poor inhabitants out of poverty. The research will make contribution to type of land 
reform which lead to sustainable development through land titling, a reduction in the probability of being evicted, or 
otherwise losing land rights and provide land users with greater assurance that they will enjoy the fruits of their labour 
and investment, thereby encouraging them to make long-term investments for sustainable use of their properties. 
Keywords 
Property rights, Housing, Regulatory framework and Governance 
1. INTRODUCTION
Land governance has been identified as an integral part to poverty reduction and provision of tenure security 
(Zakout, et al., 2009). Good governance in land administration aims to protect the property rights of individuals, 
enterprise as well as state, by introducing principles such as transparency, accountability, rule of law equity and 
participation into land related public sector.  Rights are described as socially or legally recognized entitlements to 
access, use and control areas of land and related natural resources (Zakout, et al., 2009).  Formal improvement 
refers to a house that: has a legitimate formal title, conforms with local planning regulations and building codes, 
structurally sound, and can be used as a security for a lengthy term home loan (Umhlaba Consulting Group, 2013). 
Furthermore, housing is a necessity and a basic human right and need (Mashwama, Aigbavboa &Thwala, 2018).  
Tenure security is defined as the preservation in conceptual contrast to eviction, probability of: saleability of 
property, exchange of ownership through estate, pledging as collateral for mortgage and access to loan under 
certain state of affairs (De Soto 2003). Household income, housing policies, legal ownership of property with 
correct title deeds and standards enacted by regulation are elements which have direct  impact on  property rights 
of houses occupied by the poor (Mattingly, 2013). 
2. NOTION OF RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM HOUSES
Poor governance, whether in the formal land administration or customary tenure arrangements, implies that the land 
rights are not protected (Olujimi & Iyanda, 2013). Absence of reliable approaches to record ownership of land leaves 
all spheres of government with no answers as to who are the legal owners of the land, in which side and the purpose 
for which land has been utilised (Ghebru et al., 2014). The essence of honesty and accountability favourable to 
functional trading of  land  will be nonexistence due to lack of  uncomplicated  regulatory implementation, transparent 
legislation, affordable regulatory procedures, secure type of tenure, responsive potential departments (Burns, 2007).  
3067","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Bangkok, Thailand, March 5-7, 2019

eviction, likelihood of selling the property, change of ownership by estate, use as surety for home loan and access to 
credit under a definite state of affairs (De Soto, 2003). Preserving property rights of individuals, enterprise as well as 
state, by presenting standards such as transparency, accountability, rule of law, equity and contribution into land 
related public sector is the primary objective of good regulation in land administration (Zakout, et al 2009).  
 
Poor regulation in land administration or normal tenure provisions, entails that the land rights are not secured. An 
economic regulator which delays effectiveness and prevents private investment originates from urban overcrowding 
(Olujimi & Iyanda, 2013). Properties are sold illegally by the poor in many countries and they are not incorporated in 
formalising land use and property rights (De Soto 2003 & Mashwama, Aigbavboa &Thwala, 2018). There is no record 
kept for change of ownership of low cost houses which are frequently sold illegally (Mashwama, Aigbavboa &Thwala, 
2018). In order for institutes to function efficiently, land reform as a by-law needs proper expertise  to deal with  sales 
of land that has been politically deceived under the hands of dishonest employees, hence the poor have and use land 
informally, and are not in  possession of  title deeds (Cousins et al, 2005). 
 
All levels of government have no solution as to who are the legitimate owners of land and which side and for what 
purpose the land has been used  due to lack of consistent methods to record ownership (Ghebru et al.,  2014). The poor 
reside on condition which is harmful to their well-being (Turok & McGanahan, 2013). Building plan applications of 
low income residents cannot be processed because they are not legal owners of properties (SPLUMA, 2013). It is the 
role of government to develop measures to assist the poor to establish maintainable standard of living and access to 
services and infrastructure (Turok & McGanahan, 2013).  The aim of Urban Land Management directive is to preserve, 
develop investments and prevent land use that negatively affect the value of property.  Moreover, the need of the poor 
must be directly addressed by Land Use Management system through developments of appropriate systems.  
Conforming to this type of by law reduces the probability of eviction, losing land right and reassure land and building 
users value for money on their investment (Kasimbazi, 2017). 
 
A case study   drawn up from Peru Land Titling program recognised that strengthening land tenure does not yield a 
positive household income or guarantee home loan or credit approval from financial institutions, but it can have less 
effective influence on construction of existing low cost housing (Kawaga, 2001). Furthermore, it has been revealed in 
Peru’s Land Titling Program that formalising property right does not stimulate access to housing finance, instead the 
key standard to acquire home loan is through the household income (Cockburn, 2001). An assessment conducted on 
Peru titling program indicated that titling led to an enormous decrease in credit scoring. According to Rodrick, (2000), 
indicated that formal property ownership has no implications on loan approval rates by financial institutions. 
 
7. CONCLUSION 
 
Literature review revealed that in various developing countries, poor people are essentially excluded from formalizing 
their land and property rights and, consequently, a black market exists outside of the formal economy. Moreover if 
the government of developing countries provide real property ownership with clear titles and rights enforceable by 
law, then poor people will be able to use their assets to obtain credit which can be employed in productive activities 
so that countries could get themselves and their poor inhabitants out of poverty. Other researchers found that acquiring 
formal property rights for land does not promote access to housing finance, but instead, the household income is the 
primary principle to obtain mortgage. Governance on property right is the contributing factor to control the way and 
purpose which land and buildings occupied by the poor can be used. There should be some point of accountability and 
intervention to reinforce formal property rights to existing low cost houses in order to enhance quality of life to 
beneficiaries and socio economic development of the country. There is a need to find a suitable standards for land 
management system that react to methods of urban land market that clearly address the need of the poor. The objective 
of the current legislative (Spatial Land Use Management) framework in South Africa is to protect and promote 
investment but the framework does otherwise for the poor. The Act prevents unauthorized land use that have negative 
impact on property values. 
 
8. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The study recommend a balanced socio economic development for beneficiaries of low cost housing holistically. It 
means the type of land reform that regulates low cost housing should be interlinked. It must not only provide secure 
tenure without sustainable employment. Secure tenure can only give partial security, whereas combination of security

of tenure and employment make it possible to alleviate poverty and promote investment. Beneficiaries will be able to 
apply for building plans in the event they want to extend their properties, to formally sell properties in the open market, 
use property as collateral to secure mortgage, have properties registered in their names at deeds office and be able to 
formalise all property related transactions.

Abstract 
Big data and its analysis are in the focus of current era of big data. The main production sources of big data are social 
media like Facebook, twitter, emails, mobile applications and the migration of manual to automatic of almost every 
entity. Currently, there is a need to investigate and process complex and huge sets of information-rich data in all fields. 
This paper provides a survey of big data issues and the effectual and efficient platforms and technologies which are 
needed to deal and process the remarkable amount of data. It revolves around two important areas namely: clustering 
and scheduling.

1. Introduction
The landscape of science is changing dramatically. The far reaching development of digital technology in many
fields i.e. social media, person to person communication and scientific analysis has contributed in the generation of 
huge amount of data which is collectively known as ‘Big Data’. Such data is growing enormously leading to 
difficulties in storing, processing and analyzing by using traditional databases and conventional tools and techniques. 
The processing issue is beginning to see an attainable horizon, yet at the same time has space to evolve. Thus the vital 
issue is not to store all of the data produced but to extract meaningful information and process it efficiently on the 
given resources.  
To address these issues, big data analytics is there to mine untapped information from huge volume and variety 
of data. There are some proposed platforms to cope up the issues of the Big data like Dryad, Spark, Dremel and Pregel 
(Agneeswaran, 2014), Storm, and Hadoop MapReduce. One of the most successful frameworks proposed was 
MapReduce. It was initially proposed by Google. It is especially designed for processing big data by exploiting the 
parallelism among a cluster of machines.  
The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey about the big data issues, platforms and techniques to 
solve the processing issues of big data clusters. The processing techniques are discussed in detail. Furthermore, this 
study provides the comparison for the algorithms of the processing technique. Thus, enables the reader to choose the 
appropriate selection of the technique according to the available resources.  
The organization of the paper is as follows: Different types of big data issues is discussed first. Next to it, 
platforms and techniques for big data processing will be enlightened. The platform and the big data processing 
techniques are given in an explanatory manner with its further types. In addition, main results and comparison are also 
given in form of tables. In last, conclusion and future directions will be discussed.

slower task by encountering the cluster load. It has a limitation that the scheme considers only the 
optimization of task level rather than job level performance. Then, in (Q. Chen et al., 2014) the extended 
scheme of (Ananthanarayanan et al., 2010) has been produced and named as Grass for handling the jobs 
by encountering the normal jobs rather than small. But, still is lacking in encountering the long jobs.   
A straggler handling scheme was proposed in (S. Chen et al., 2014) which perform the redundant 
requesting of storage codes and then analyzing it while the service time for as task shows an exponential 
growth. Furthermore, in (Ren, Ananthanarayanan, Wierman, & Yu, 2015) a speculative based 
scheduling algorithm named as Hopper is proposed. The scheduling algorithm i.e. Hopper makes the 
virtual size of the each task bigger than its actual size. It allocates the resources on the bases of the virtual 
size to detect the stragglers. Upon the detection, it re-schedules the whole virtual size data to the other 
nodes. The downside in its works is the wastage of the resources not only by allocating the resources 
more than the needed but also on the point of resolving the issue. Next, Self-Adaptive scheduling scheme 
was proposed in (Quan Chen, Zhang, Guo, Deng, & Guo, 2010). It distinguishes the slower and faster 
tasks merely and does not provide any effective solution to handle the stragglers.  
Further, a scheme named as Failure-Aware, Retrospective and Multiplicative Speculation (FARMS) is 
proposed in (Fu, Chen, Zhu, & Yu, 2017). FARMS measures the responsiveness of each node. In case 
of detection of the unresponsive node, it copies the whole tasks running on that node to the other node. 
The main flaw of the FARMS is that it replicates the whole tasks while the cause of the un-
responsiveness might be one or more tasks not the whole number of tasks running on the given node. 
Therefore, it produces more replication overhead with the wastage of resources. Recently, an 
optimization for speculative execution scheme to mitigate stragglers is presented in (Xu & Lau, 2017). 
However the presented scheme degrades the system performance badly by posing a limit on the 
dimensions of the facts and a ratio of stragglers just cut down underneath the threshold edge. In addition, 
along with the above scheme it also lacks in encountering the data-dependency among the tasks.  The 
comparison of the straggling handling algorithms is shown in Table 2.

5. Conclusion 
Big data and its analytics is still in its initial stage but evolving at a great speed. The vast sums of data are a 
consequence of jobs from different variety, which generally stored within big data clusters.  Big data clustering and 
scheduling are appearing one of the active research areas which plays a vital role in the completion of big data 
processing and effectively utilizing the cluster resources. To conclude, viable processing of Exabyte’s of information 
would require broad parallel handling with a specific end goal to give convenient and significant data. MapReduce 
based clusters has been appearing as the most effective big data solutions. It empowers parallelism along with several 
low-end computing nodes. In addition, there is no common task scheduling algorithm to accommodate and handle 
different type of jobs at the same time. For the future research direction, the big data platform should be able to handle 
different type of jobs for the processing of big data.

Abstract 
One of the constraints faced by low cost housing projects is poor governance, hence the examination of corporate 
governance and sustainability on low cost housing. Literature is the main method used to investigate the research 
problem. Published, unpublished papers and journals were accurately reviewed to find solutions to the subject matter. 
The study revealed that it is a prerequisite in terms of the National Environmental Management Act for National and 
provincial department to formulate an Environmental Implementation Plan for any building construction activities 
that will have an impact on the environment.  Green and sustainable are the terms congested on yearly reports of 
companies, but the question is whether the Corporate Social Responsibility is valued. The paper will assist the industry 
to realise that: the achievement of companies does not rely on compliance of legislation and standards only, but also 
by a broad series of economic, environment and social problem in a manner that is useful to the whole society globally. 
Organisational sustainability enforces environmental standards to be adhered and ISO 14001 standard help companies 
to improve environmental performance by reducing waste, efficient use of resources, receive integrity of partner and 
be successful. 
Keywords 
Compliance, Corporate Social Responsibility, Environment. 
1. INTRODUCTION
Principles of corporate governance requires companies to satisfy their commitments to the holistic society on 
which they work and being accountable for their activity in the general public. Companies are required to think 
beyond generating profit to the way on which their conduct impact the community in which they work (Naidoo, 
2009).The prosperity of a company must reflect the transition from unsustainable to sustainable development by 
eliminating waste and pollution while using less resources and producing more products and services. This simply 
means that the success of a company does not solely depend on short and long term capital but also a lengthy 
period ecosystem and social capital (Rothaus, N.D).  Lately companies are recognised as the primary source of 
social, economic and environmental issues. They are broadly noticed to be successful by compromising the need 
of the society at large (Porter & Kramer 2011).  An incredible challenge to regular business strategies with its 
attention on shareholder returns have developed movements like globalisation, climate change, societal unfairness 
and demographic transition (Wales, 2013).  CSR is a methodology that stimulate corporate governance which 
bring about sustainability, hence the social responsibility of a company raises financial income (Blaga, 2013). Low 
cost affordable housing is a lengthy investment cycle that must be advantageous to its beneficiaries as far as 
comfort, quality, and life expectancy is concerned (Jenkin et al 2007). A financially effective construction industry 
improves environmental sustainability by ensuring low cost techniques of development that support best 
distribution of resources and minimise losses. Economically viable within the construction business requires that: 
social and ecological cost are approved and registered in the final cost of an item, (du Plessis & Landman 2002).

interpretations given to events and things, as well as their behavior The qualitative approach provides perceptions to 
social components of the procedures amongst agencies (Mashwama, Aigbavboa &Thwala, 2017).  
 
11. LESSON LEARNT FROM LITERATURE 
 
From literature we have deduce that for the development of environmental sustainable green affordable housing in 
cities can be viable if there is a strong leadership and skilled professional regarding the subject matter; A vision of the 
end product and its benefits; a public policy commitment to green building; the need for underwriters willing to factor 
green into affordability; and education for professionals, residents and property managers, maintance staff so as to 
learn how to take care of the materials. Low cost housing is a long term investment which must benefit beneficiaries 
in terms of comfort, quality and life expectancy (Jenkin et al 2007). Businesses are currently viewed as the main 
causes of social, economic and environmental problems. Companies are prosperous hence neglecting the need of the 
broader society (Porter & Kramer 2011). The main idea of sustainable development in the Production of South African 
Standards and regulations is extraordinarily included in planning and housing policy (RSA, 1994). According to 
Department of Housing 2001 – 2002, various sustainable low cost housing projects and programmes were undertaken 
through Environmental Implementation Plan as an initiative, measure and compliance to impact lives of beneficiaries 
of low cost housing by: Influencing designs of about 60 000 houses to promote energy efficiency; Developing a 
financial system to enhance environmentally efficient and green  low cost housing projects; Planting trees to newly 
subsidised houses and Providing training courses on sustainable housing. 
 
Furthermore, The South African constitution is said to be modern and international acceptable as it is one of the few 
constitution that incorporates the right for clean and protected environment. Constitution of the Republic of South 
Africa is the regulatory framework regarding environmental rights. It states that everybody has the right to the 
environment that is not dangerous to their health and well-being. The success of a business must reveal the evolution 
from unsustainable to sustainable development by reducing waste and contamination whereas utilising fewer assets 
and delivering more goods and services (Rothaus, N.D). It is mandatory requirement to comply with environmental 
principles through assessments presently in organisational sustainability (Oke & Aigbavboa, 2017). Terms which are 
often overfilled on businesses annual reports are green and sustainability, however the query is whether the Corporate 
Social Responsibility is treasured or well thought of or extremely considered (O’Mara et al 2012). The globally 
established standard which plans requirements for Environmental Management System is known as ISO 14001 to 
support businesses to improve environmental performance by reducing waste, effective use of resources, obtaining 
integrity of partners and competitive benefit (International Organization for Standardization, 2015).  
 
Regions that were primary polluters of natural environment in Germany are the now good examples of clean 
environments through the substantial influence of ISO14001 standard which resulted to improvement in water and air 
quality in Europe (Ferguson 2014). The literature revealed that triple bottom model known as the people, planet and 
profit comprises the integration of social, environmental and economic attributes into business aspects and good 
practice (Jones et   al, 2006). Social sustainability should consider all elements that contribute to poor environmental 
quality which may be a good response to promote social cohesion and not depend solely on ecological quality (Demsy 
et al 2011). According to Okeahalam &Akinboande (2003), the challenges faced by companies in implementing 
corporate governance as state above should be seriously addressed since it would be creating safeguards against 
corruption and mismanagement, promoting transparency in economic life and attracting more domestic and foreign 
investors. Furthermore, the development of capacity in firms, government and civil society to develop systems and 
effectively monitor compliance will be critical to achieving the goal of good corporate governance.   
 
12. CONCLUSION 
 
Currently, organizational sustainability is an established requirements with various mandatory prerequisites through 
survey enforcing environmental standards to be adhered to. Therefore it is highly recommended that construction 
companies are good corporate citizens, ensuring responsible business by incorporating Environmental, Sustainability 
and Governance into their businesses. Compliance to standards and legislative requirements forms the integral part of 
good corporate governance and sustainability on low cost and affordable green housing and companies. Construction 
companies are obliged in terms of the National Environmental Management Act for National and provincial 
department to formulate an Environmental Implementation Plan for any building construction activities that will have 
an influence on the environment and the constitution of the republic also enforces and regulates the rights of citizens

holistically and states that everyone has a right to an environment that is not harmful to their health and well-being. 
Internationally companies are required to disclose any project that will have an environmental impact under the Carbon 
Disclosure Project.  The literature review revealed that the achievement of the organisation does not only rely on 
compliance of legislation and standards, but also by a broad series of economic, environment and social problem in a 
manner that is useful to the whole community and society internationally.

Abstract 
Pilot study is a step to evaluate the effectiveness of survey instrument as a medium of communication between 
researchers and respondents. This paper aims to get the instrument ready for use on actual data retrieval. Pilot study 
is divided into two stages, qualitative pilot study and quantitative pilot study. In qualitative pilot study, the researcher 
used nine respondents, while for the quantitative study used 36 respondents. Based on the results, the studies obtained 
the questionnaires are ready to be used in the process of pilot study quantitative. In the pilot quantitative study obtained 
the result that of the ninety-nine items of question there are four items that are invalid so that should be discarded. For 
variable reliability, all variables have a Cronbach alpha value greater than 0.6 so it can be said that all variables are 
reliable and used in further surveys.

1. Introduction
Organizational creativity is the most discussed topic by academicians. This has been proved by the number of articles 
with the keyword of organizational creativity published in google scholar (1,220,000). A research on organizational 
creativity can be associated with several fields, most of which is psychology (Barron and Harrington, 1981; Gurteen 
and Associates, 1998; King and Anderson, 1990, Payne, 1990, Carrol, 1985), with creative products or product 
innovation (Amabile, 1983; Woodman et al., 1993; Cokpekin and Knudsen, 2011; Moldoveanu and Langer, 2011), 
with knowledge management (Migdadi, 2005; Chen, 2012). 
A study on such fields as innovation and business was initiated by Amabile (1988), who developed creativity model 
and organizational innovation. In addition, Woodman et al. (1993) developed multilevel models of organizational 
creativity including individual, group, and organization. Both researchers are pioneers of research on organizational 
creativity. Their research resulted in a conceptual model of research on organizational creativity.  
The article aims at conducting a pilot study of the resulted research models (Indriartiningtias et al, 2017). The purpose 
of the pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of survey instrument as communication medium between researchers 
and respondents.

1994). Face validity and content validity were carried out in qualitative manners on stag of qualitative pilot study. 
This part discusses validity of research variables measured in quantitative manners using convergent validity, 
particularly Pearson Correlation. The measurement of validity results in the elimination of 1 item of independent 
variables X1 and 2 items of variables X3. Therefore, the remaining number of items to measure instruments X1 and X3 
is 19 and 33, respectively. 
 
Reliability of instrument is related to consistency of instrument measurement indicated by value of coefficient of 
Cronbach alpha (α) on each variable. A method proposed by Cronbach (1951) is useful to measure item consistency 
on similar variables (inter-item reliability). The values of coefficient of alpha of all variables are regarded high (above 
0.7) (Ghozali, 2006). The overview of the valid number of items, including the reliability and category can be seen 
from Table 5.

It is clear from Table 5 that all variables have been consistently used to measure research variables. Several invalid 
items were eliminated and were not used in the subsequent process. 
 
5. Conclusions and Suggestions 
 
The article discusses the results of pilot study on creativity of creative industries in Indonesia. Qualitative pilot study 
results in an instrument free from typographical errors, punctuation errors, avoids uncommon or sensitive words and 
long questionnaire causing respondents to find difficulties to fill. The results of the pilot study were used in stage of 
quantitative pilot study. 
   
Quantitative pilot study is a process to examine the reliability and consistency levels of an instrument used. The stage 
results in an instrument which is ready to be used for the main study. 
 
This study has several drawbacks. First, on the first stage of qualitative study, only respondents of doctoral students 
were involved. Therefore, further studies should involve respondents of non-industry parties coming from several 
levels. Second, data obtained from the results of the pilot study can actually be used to identify initial phenomenon of 
creativity process on creative industries in Indonesia. For that reason, the process should be done not only to test the 
instrument, but also to identify initial phenomenon occurring in creative industries in Indonesia. Further studies on 
initial phenomenon of organizational creativity on creative industries in Indonesia should be carried out.

4.2. Quantitative Pilot Study 
 
The data collection of the qualitative pilot study was done by distributing questionnaires previously tested in 
qualitative manners. Questionnaires were distributed directly and indirectly (using email). 
 
4.2.1. Respondents 
 
Creative industries were selected to be respondents of pilot study using convenience sampling from database. 
Respondents are expected to have good representation as creative industries in term of creativity process. Due to time 
limitation of the pilot study, 70 questionnaires were distributed. Of the 70 questionnaires, 36 questionnaires were 
completely filled by respondents of creative industries (response rate of 50%).  
 
All responses were made in a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Based on 
characteristics of research variables, the questionnaire is divided into three groups of respondents. Each group of 
respondents was asked to fill different questionnaires: (1) top management, (2) head of department/ design group/ R 
and D, and (3) design employees. 
The study used 7 variables comprising 3 independent variables (exogenous): individual creativity (X1) with total 
number of 20 items, group creativity (X2) with total number of 18 items, characteristics of organizational environment 
(X3) with total number of 35 items, and 2 dependent variables (endogenous): organizational creativity (Y1) with total 
number of 16 items and organization performance (Y2) with total number of 5 items. The description of variables

Abstract 
Burn-in is generally known as a compelling methods for screening out early failures to 
prevent defective parts shipped to consumers. This project was conducted in a burn-in service 
provider industry that has been a leading provider of semiconductor testing and burn-in 
services for more than 45 years. With significant milestones in achieving internationally 
recognized quality awards such as QS 9000, the company strive towards service excellence, 
seeking to expand capacity in all laboratories and expand the markets for extensive range of 
test and measurement products. This project focuses mainly on 144lds ICs since this product 
is always having customer complaint due to the sliver defect escaping to their end customers 
causing premature failures due to short circuits. Additional process like 40x inspection is 
required to screen out the defect which affected the overall cycle time and output for this 
144lds product. This process is time consuming and delays other lots for shipment and 
production facing hard time to meet the output. More over the company is spending 
additional man power cost which is none value added to the company to screen out the 
defects. Therefore the root cause of misload which creates the sliver defect was identified to 
be mainly on machine related issues and the most cost effective solution by installing misload 
sensors and single press plate was successfully implemented to eliminate the defect using six 
sigma approach. Besides that, the overall cycle time was improved by 19% by solving sliver 
issue and man power cost of around 400,000 Ringgit Malaysia was reduced by the 
elimination of  40X inspection process. The successful implementation of the misload sensors 
and single press plate at autoloader has lead to zero returns from customers and substantial 
cost saving for this company's Burn-in test operations through the elimination of manual 40X 
inspection process.

1. Introduction
Burn-in is one such technique that is broadly used inside the semiconductor industry process to encounter the 
need to provide the guarantee of reliability that conforms to an industry standard. This burn-in service industry 
offers semiconductor companies with testing services. The company are well known for conducting burn-in 
services for integrated circuit which has different type of lead count such as 64lds, 80lds, 100lds, 144lds and 
176lds. The types of products that have been classified are loaded in different type of burn-in boards and 
undergoes different burn-in durations.  
It will be mainly focusing on 144lds ICs since this product is always having customer quality complaint due to 
the defect it caused from the foot and riser of the lead at loading process. The defect on the lead as mentioned is 
caused by the sharp area of the socket pin which scratch the lead surface when the device is misplace in the 
socket. Additional process like 40x inspection is required to screen out the defect which affecting the overall 
cycle time for this product. The improvement will be focusing on the elimination of the defect and cycle time

4.5 Summary on Implementation 
 
With all the improvement done, the 40x inspection process and the man power can be totally removed to make 
profit for the company after confirming on the effectiveness of the misload sensor in preventing the escapee of 
misload out of autoloader and ensuring zero sliver by monitoring few more lots under 100% 40X inspection. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The DMAIC methodology as the Six-Sigma approach was used in this burn-in test company to solve the sliver 
escapee to the customer by identifying the root cause using analysis tools such as fish bone and kaizen and

implemented. The improvement was done on all the loading machine at production floor. The root cause of the 
sliver defect had successfully determined. 40X inspection removal will be done after confirming no sliver from 
all the 50 lots loaded in the loaders equipped with misload sensor module which will definitely help to improve 
the overall cycle time by 9 hours of reduction. Corrective actions to solve this quality problem has been 
suggested and implemented. The solution has gained huge customer trust during Continuous Improvement Plan

Petroleum is one of the industries that has a massive impact on living conditions of the population. Petroleum 
distribution network plays an increasingly important function in delivering value to the end user. The objective of this 
research is to study the current petroleum distribution network in Sri Lanka, identify the inefficiencies and causing 
critical factors and propose an optimization model to overcome these inefficiencies. A conceptual framework has been 
developed based on the findings observed from critical review of literature and further data was collected from Sri 
Lankan petroleum industry domain experts using in-depth interviews. It has been identified that Sri Lankan petroleum 
distribution network is not taken in to account for the optimization. Hence, it is performed by developing a 
mathematical model in this research. The proposed model is validated with complex and real data extracted from 
research findings. VBA (Visual Basic Application) is used to gain exact mathematical optimization. It is concluded 
from the study that distribution network overall cost can be minimized when causing critical factors are optimized. 
Thus, this study depicts an optimization model, with the purpose of minimizing the cost, based on inefficiencies and 
causing critical factors which are specific for Sri Lankan petroleum industry.  
Key words: Petroleum Distribution Network, Inefficiencies, Cost, Optimization 
1. Introduction
The study will consider the network optimization for petroleum distribution network in Sri Lanka. Petroleum 
distribution network is a part of Petroleum Supply Chain (PSC). The process flow of fuel deposit exploration to 
petroleum product end user customer, is called Petroleum Supply Chain (PSC). Petroleum industry contributes for 
transportation, power generation, agro chemicals, residential, commercial and industrial needs etc.  Petroleum 
industry’s complexity has grown as a result of tight competition, strict environmental regulations, high operational 
costs and low margin profits. The petroleum product demand fluctuation and the present scenario of high petroleum 
crude oil prices fluctuation demonstrate that industries and markets all over the world are impacted by the volatility 
and uncertainty of the petroleum industry. These reasons drive petroleum industry toward strategic planning and 
optimization with respective to the uncertainties and constraints in factors such as the source, raw materials 
availability, expected market demand, production costs and distribution costs. The ultimate objective of the work is 
to optimize the petroleum distribution network while minimizing the overall cost and maximizing the customer’s level 
of service. Therefore it is important to have an optimized petroleum distribution network, since petroleum products 
cost a high amount. The cost of maintaining a well optimized distribution network is a considerable component of the 
total costs of petroleum products. By the using of well managed distribution execution it is expected to reduce the 
distribution cost and by that to reduce the total cost of the petroleum products. It is important that the products are 
delivered on time and efficiently with the required quality without tone down customer satisfaction. Optimization is 
the methodology for improving the quality and desirability of a product or product concept. It is the process of finding 
function extreme to solve problems and finding an alternative with the most cost effective or highest achievable 
performance under the given constraints, by maximizing desired factors and minimizing undesired factors.  
The scope of the research is the intersection of three operational areas such as petroleum supply chain, distribution 
network and optimization. The research problem, “How to overcome the inefficiencies in petroleum distribution 
network in Sri Lanka” is justified based on two main pillars, “why we have to optimize the petroleum distribution 
network in Sri Lanka” and “Why there are inefficiencies in petroleum distribution network in Sri Lanka”. Three main 
reasons for inefficiencies, were identified based on research findings. They are respectively petroleum industry 
demand uncertainty, petroleum industry supply uncertainty and petroleum supply chain’s complex distribution 
network.

6. Conclusion 
In this research, the proposed model is validated with complex and real data that was collected from Sri Lankan 
petroleum industry (CPSTL, Kolonnawa). VBA is used to gain exact mathematical optimization. The qualitative and 
quantitative analysis of data has been done to evaluate the research findings. It is concluded from the study that the 
overall cost of the petroleum distribution network can be minimized by optimizing the causing critical factors. Thus, 
this study depicts a distribution network optimization model, with the purpose of minimizing the cost, based on 
inefficiencies and causing critical factors which are specific for Sri Lankan petroleum industry. As a result, the 
developed optimization model would enable the Sri Lankan petroleum industry to achieve higher performance leading 
to competitive advantage.

Abstract 
In this study, we model the classical newsvendor ordering preferences under ambiguity. The extant 
literature on normative models in the newsvendor setting assumes decision-making under risk, where 
decision-maker has exact knowledge of the probabilities associated with the outcomes. In several 
business situations, the demand distribution is often incomplete or unknown. This results in decision-
making 
under ambiguous situations. Decision theory recognizes the difference between exact 
probabilities and more realistic ambiguous probabilities. In his seminal paper, Scarf (1958) develops 
a max-min approach for the newsvendor with incomplete demand information. In the Scarf model, 
the newsvendor is assumed to be risk-neutral and ambiguity averse. In the recent experimental 
literature, it has been observed that the newsvendor behavior is not consistent with the Scarf 
model, and exhibits pull-to- center bias and other biases. This motivates our research to develop 
quantitative models under ambiguity to describe the observed biases in the literature.

Abstract 
The purpose of this research is to gain insights on the entrepreneurial intentions of UAE youths. A sample of 303 students (over 
15 years of age) from UAE based schools and higher educational institutions were surveyed using a questionnaire to gauge 
their perspective on choosing entrepreneurship as a career. Three main categories of factors influencing their career 
choices were taken into account, namely their socioeconomic status, familial background and personality traits. The analysis 
that follows breaks down the explained entrepreneurial intention into ‘Perception of Entrepreneurship in Society’ and 
‘Preference for Entrepreneurship as a Career Choice’ in order to develop a causal relationship between how the UAE youth 
perceives entrepreneurs around them and how that influences their aspirations to opt for the same as a career choice 
upon completion of their education. Linkages between demographic factors (like age, gender and nationality), socioeconomic 
status and family background have been taken into account in the first two sections where their influence on the said perception 
and preference is analysed. In the third section of this analysis, the correlation between the Big Five personality traits and 
entrepreneurial intent of the youth is assessed, in order to identify which of these five personality traits have the 
strongest influence on a young individual’s perception of entrepreneurial activities and the consequent decision to choose 
entrepreneurship as a preferred career path. The study will assist in reducing the youth unemployment through the development 
of sustainable entrepreneurial culture and ventures in the United Arab Emirates and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
countries as a whole due to its homogenous socio-cultural and economic context.

Introduction 
Entrepreneurship has been identified as the best solution to the problem of unemployment, and further economic 
development (Jabeen et al. 2017). Despite of the recognition that entrepreneurship is vital to job creation and economic 
growth globally, we do not have sufficient knowledge to promote this critical factor in the youth sector. Young people 
are the parents, decision-makers, business people and leaders of tomorrow. Investment in today's young men and 
women is actually an investment in the future of our nation. Research on entrepreneurial area has increased since its 
influence on the economic and the social development has been acknowledged (Goel et al. 2007). In this context, 
entrepreneurial intent has proven to be a primary predictor of future entrepreneurial behavior (Katz, 1988), (Reynolds, 
1995), (Krueger et al. 2000). Therefore, investigating what factors determine the entrepreneurial intent is a crucial 
issue in entrepreneurship research. In general, intent can be defined as “a state of mind directing a person’s attention 
toward a specific object or a path in order to achieve something” (Vesalainen and Pihkala,1999). 
In previous research, personal and environment-based determinants of entrepreneurial intent such as personality traits, 
attitudes toward entrepreneurship, or social environment have been extensively discussed (Begley et al. 1997), 
(Brandsta¨tter, 1997), (Davidsson, 1995), (Franke and Luthje, 2004), (Robinson et al., 1991), (Segal, et al. 2005).

very short due to the submission deadlines. It is also suggested that the future research should be conducted in other 
Emirates to analyze the comparative picture of all 7 Emirates. It is suggested that the policy-makers and government 
agencies must identify what drives people to start new businesses, maximize the number of start-ups aspiring to and 
achieving high growth, and drive the elements of a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem.

1. Introduction
AL FANAR Restaurant & Café is a famous restaurant who raved Emirati food in United Arab Emirates. With the 
passage of time, AL FANAR Restaurant & Café has gained excellent and well reputation locally, because the 
restaurant promotes the national culture, Society, traditions, food tastes of UAE country and it is planning to expand 
its operations in globally. After a thorough analysis, we came down to choose AL FANAR Restaurant & Café as an 
option for expansion outside the national border. 
This case study analyzing how Kuwait market will be good for operating the business of Al Fanar Restaurant & 
Café. The entry model of the restaurant is influenced by varied internal and external factors. The study describes 
food and beverages market in Kuwait. For the purpose of risk free and profitable entry, a careful analysis has been 
undertaken to identify best suitable country for expansion. We will be considering the (SWOT Analysis) strength, 
weakness, opportunities and threat. Also, (PESTEL+C Analysis) political, economic, social, technological, 
environmental, legal aspects, competitors and varied modes of entry. 
2. About Al Fanar
A small museum of Emirati culture. This is the idea of establishing the popular AL Fanar restaurant in the country, 
to introduce its visitors, both residents and tourists, to the local culture, although many of its close associates were 
disdainful of the idea. The idea changed completely and became its supporters. The restaurant was opened in Dubai 
on September 2011 for a trial period of one month before officially opening in October of the same year with 100 
employees. Within three years, three (two in Dubai) and one in Abu Dhabi, with 310 employees, opened branches 
across GCC and the world in a strategic plan for the period 2014-2017. 
A phone interview has been arranged on October 10, 2017 with Hashim AL Marzouqi – The Chairman of Al Fanar 
Restaurant and Cafe. He mentioned the success story of Al-Fanar, saying that ""In 2010, I read a report of one of the 
local newspapers that published the fact of the absence of the UAE restaurant from shopping centers in the UAE. 
The idea of creating a restaurant that is a miniature museum of UAE heritage, to aware the citizen and foreign visitor 
in the history of the state. The restaurant, which was the first branch in a commercial center in Dubai, was keen on 
the details of heritage to aware the visitors of Dubai, especially the local cuisine in another word that the UAE 
cuisine is derived from several kitchens, most notably Indian and Iranian”. 
The chairman adds “I was a trader and an expert in other companies, and the restaurants needed different 
management, but I was designed to implement them. A year after opening the first branch, I invited my father to 
visit the restaurant and commented: If you told me the idea as I did it, you would be the first supporter. Many people 
have limited information about our heritage, and most of them have not entered the local museums only once or 
twice in his life, and if we turn to ask foreigners about science may make mistakes in its colors, and it is our duty to 
spread the heritage of the UAE and teach the people of the community”. 
The project was planned and studied for a year and a half, and a budget of five million dirhams. The chairman 
studied the history of the UAE country in detail for eight months, including the buildings and interior design of the 
historic houses, in addition to the popular food and utensils. The popular cuisine derived from the family recipes, 
and try to find out the proportion of success among the public. pointing out that he searched for the best family 
recipes among old local women of their neighbors and from their family knowledge to take the best tastes and 
experience, and then add them to the food’s menu.

Abstract 
The fourth industrial revolution is being fostered in many countries to make more efficient and flexible plants. 
Industry 4.0 target is to get a more competitive industry. Under this framework, improvement of mineral processing 
requires knowledge of previous methods and current technology in order to develop new techniques and 
approaches. As phosphate deposition decreases, the need for new recovery methods keeps growing. From this 
perspective, the need for control and optimization of existing processes becomes a necessity. It also includes the 
development of equipment with more advanced digitized components. The objective of our work is to develop a 
model of a process plant using SysML. In this paper, we adopted a system engineering-based approach, which 
consists on modeling and formalizing knowledge collected in the field. A well understanding of phosphate value 
chain allows both driving and optimizing current processes. In addition, we used this approach to model 
information flows in which we integrated a specific equipment in the overall process. This model will follow a 
systems engineering approach. In this paper we present the development of the SysML model of a process plant 
(Wash plant of phosphate). The model includes the requirements as well as the structure, behaviour and activity

The preparation of the Excel material balance was made from the particle size distribution obtained at the 
laboratory scale. The results found make it possible to calculate the mass flow rate of solid (ton/h), the water flow 
(m3/h), the solid rate (%), the density (ton/m3) and the volume flow rate of the pulp (m3 / h) at the output of each 
equipment. (Figure 4) 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Model-Based Engineering is necessary for the engineering of the industry 4.0 systems. In this paper we have 
developed a SysML model of a process Wash Plant of phosphates. This model can be used for the design of the 
plant and for all the engineering activities through the plant life cycle. Our adopted approach summarizes various 
modeling tools working with a well-known industrial partner in Phosphate valorization. Using these approaches, 
we will guarantee efficient beneficiation processes by optimizing their operating parameters. Simulation through 
Excel allows the analysis of properties and performance of each equipment. 
In future works, we will investigate the possibility to generate Excel simulation from any SysML model by 
defining a map from SysML to Excel elements.

Abstract 
PT. Indonesia Toray Sinthetic is a textile company. In providing inventory to produce products, it is 
necessary to have a good inventory control and in accordance with production demand. Inventory control in 
this company often has problems, one of which is excess stock. Material Requirement Planning (MRP) is a 
method used to control raw material inventories in a company. A company to implement policies in raw 
material planning must have the right calculation so that there are no excesses and shortcomings in the supply 
of raw materials. This study used the forecasting method of Linear Trend Analysis, Constant, Exponential 
Smoothing and Moving Average. The Material Requirement Planning (MRP) methods used are Lot For Lot 
(LFL), Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Fixed Order Quantity (FOQ), and Fixed Period Requirement 
(FPR). The best forecasting result is the Trend Linear Analysis with the smallest error value and the best 
results from the Material Requirement Planning (MRP) method used is the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) 
with a total save cost of Rp 720,000 and the total order cost of Rp 68,552,500 with a total total cost of IDR 
69,272,500. So by using the Material Requirement Planning (MRP) method with the Lot Sizing technique in 
the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), the company PT. Indonesia Toray Sinthetic can minimize total 
inventory costs and be more efficient at Rp 81,887,500. - that is, it can be more than 50%.

Introduction
1.1 Background 
The dilemma of a company to determine how much inventory must be provided and when the inventory 
must be ordered back is a problem that must be solved with good inventory control. Because with good 
inventory control, the company will know when the inventory will run out and must be ordered again to 
the supplier, and how much inventory will be ordered related to the company forecasting and customer 
demand. To solve these problems, especially for raw material requirements planning, a Material 
Requriements Planning (MRP) system has been developed. MRP is an information system used to 
calculate the material requirements needed to produce finished goods, Greasley (2008) in Arief (2017). 
MRP implementation is very helpful in planning raw materials based on planned production quantities. 
1.2 Problem Formulation 
1.2.1 What is the forecasting method at PT. Indonesia Toray Sinthetic?

The best Material Requirement Planning (MRP) that produces an ordered value or cost and keeps the 
minimum for the Lot For Lot (LFL) method, the total cost obtained is Rp. 17,325,000. In theory, the method 
does have the minimum total inventory cost due to production conditions. the same as the number of orders 
that exist so as to reduce stock inventory and minimize storage costs. However, if it is realized, the method is 
not appropriate if applied to the company because there is no spare, so the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) 
method is also chosen which also has a minimum total cost of Rp. 69,272,500. PT. Indonesia Toray Sinthetic 
can minimize total inventory costs and be more efficient at Rp 81,887,500. - that is, it can be more than 50%. 
 
IV. Conclusion and Suggestion 
 
1.1 Conclusion 
 
1. After doing calculations with several forecasting methods, namely Linear Trend method, Constant, 
Moving Average N = 2 - N = 6, Exponential Smoothing α = 0.1 - α = 0.9. Through several forecasting 
methods, the Trend Linear Analysis forecasting method is the best and most appropriate forecasting 
method because it has the smallest error value and does not exceed the control limit in the Moving 
Range Chart. 
 
2. Inventory control planning is carried out by the Material Requirement Planning (MRP) method with 
Lot Sizing techniques used are LFL, EOQ, FOQ, FPR. From the results of a comparison of all lot sizing 
methods, it can be seen that the Lot For Lot (LFL) method and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) are the 
best Material Requirement Planning (MRP) methods that produce order values or fees and keep the 
minimum but for the Lot For Lot method (LFL) if it is realized the method is not appropriate if applied 
to the company because there is no spare, so the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method is also 
chosen which also has a minimum total cost of Rp 69,272,500. PT. Indonesia Toray Sinthetic can

50%. 
 
1.2 Suggestion 
 
1. In system forecast, the company should consider the other forcasting methods not only rely on one 
forecasting method, so the company can use a better forecasting method later because at PT. Indonesia 
Toray Sinthetic has not yet had a clear inventory control method, so for the future the company should 
implement a material requirements planning method with the appropriate Material Requirement Planning 
(MRP) method.  
 
2. For raw material inventories, based on problem solving analysis, companies are expected to be able to 
apply the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method to minimize the total cost of inventory and to plan 
for ordering raw materials optimally.

Abstract 
In the Philippines, Generation Y or called “millennials” dominate the population as it constitutes 60% of it. 
Millennials are most likely to experience the highest stress level which grew by 36% in 2012. Further 
assessment shows that Millennials share the highest percentage as they account for 75% of the workforce. 
With this, employee’s absenteeism and productivity were largely affected and in return, it yields to an 
estimated cost to an employer of $300B annually. With an aim to relieve stress caused by different variables, 
researchers formulate an ergonomically designed product which intends to deal and cope up with chronic 
stress. After a keen assessment which was based on 120 random samples, it is found in the normal 
distribution that the average height of Asian men is 162-164cm while Asian women with 150-153cm 
through the aid of anthropometry principle. The recommendation presented in this research is an ergonomic 
design backpack which has an intention to promote relaxation through massage support system more 
particularly dealing with pressure points of the human body, thus reducing stress level and help person 
function effectively and efficiently in any way possible.

1. Introduction
Population is vastly increasing among Asian countries and millennials (people born between early 1980’s, mid-1990 
and early 2000’s) dominate as it constitutes a quarter of Asia’s population, which is approximately 60% of the world 
population [1]. In addition, the United States Bureau of Labor predicts that by the year 2030, the tech-savvy generation 
will constitute 75% of the workforce. [2] Also, according to the 2015 survey conducted by PSA, it lies that almost 
half of labor force population of the Philippines were millennials [3] These people belong to different group of 
consumers comprising of diverse customer segments which varies depending on the industry, location and culture 
they belong to [4] It is also evident that these people rank the highest percentage of work martyrs due to strenuous 
work, working long hours and minimal vacation leaves.  Over the years, further studies show that millennials 
experience the highest stress levels as compared to other generations in the working force, evident with an increased 
rate of 36%. [5] 
Based on a recent survey conducted by ComPsych, work stress experienced by these people is shown to be attributable 
to the heavy workload (36%), people issues (31%), work-life balance (20%), and job security (8%). [6] These stress-
occurring reasons leading to occupational stress is associated with effects on labor absenteeism, health-related 
concerns (ie. low back pain), and low worker productivity which may result to an estimated company profit loss of 
US$300 billion annually. [7] With occupational stress seems to be prevalent, it greatly affects humans physically and 
psychologically as it directly brings impact on their health, well-being, and relationships towards others. People

Abstract 
Tiles industry is the prime ceramic product which widely uses in Sri Lanka. Wall tiles, Floor tiles, and Roof tiles are 
the major products of tile industry outlet. In Sri Lankan building construction applications, ceramic floor tiles show a 
significant contribution when compared with other floor development materials Today’s world is more concerned 
about environmental awareness with continuous growth unsustainable manufacturing practices. Therefore, many 
manufacturers are trying to create more and more eco-friendly processes and products by minimizing the effects of 
their activities on the environment. Although, as a developing country, the environmental performance of the tiles 
manufacturing sector and improvement of the product quality and performance are key factors to improve the 
sustainability. In order to go for a green future, it is needed to identify the environmental hotspots generates by the 
manufacturing sector. the product life cycle assessment (LCA) is an effective tool in the identification of 
environmental hotspots. In addition to that, it is required to model different life cycle scenarios for the improvement 
of Life Cycle Management (LCM). Therefore, this research focuses on conducting LCA towards eco-design on floor 
tile industry by using sensitivity analysis as well as scenario analysis. Through this study, local floor tile industry can 
be driven to improve its overall sustainability of the floor tile manufacturing sector.

Abstract 
Innovation in the United States (US) has begun to lag behind other developed nations, jeopardizing the nation’s 
economic health and political influence. While federal agencies and policymakers focus efforts on spurring innovation 
through business-centered initiatives, universities play a prominent role in spurring innovation long-term by 
developing the next generation of innovative engineers.  
The University of Arkansas’ College of Engineering (COE) is addressing this challenge by infusing innovation 
principles and processes into its curriculum by creating new courses and adapting existing ones. These courses will 
equip COE students with the skills and experiences to become engineering innovators. Entrepreneurs and industry 
sponsors are partnering with COE to provide real-world innovation experiences, which will ultimately help fulfill 
employer demand for engineering graduates with highly marketable innovation skills.  
This paper provides an overview of the relevant literature used to design and develop COE’s Innovation Initiative: 1) 
the First-year Innovation Experience, a two-semester freshman engineering innovation sequence focused on 
innovation; 2) Industrial Engineering Senior Design/Capstone Experience, an adaptation of a two-semester IE course 
sequence through which student teams implement complex innovation projects. Finally, this paper reviews the critical 
role industry plays in course development and how it can continue to refine engineering innovation instruction.

Abstract 
 
Big data and its analysis are in the focus of current era. The volume of data production is tremendous and 
a significant part of delivered data is not utilized because of the limited assets to store and process them 
efficiently. The world acclaimed platform that can efficiently deal with the gigantic amount of data in a 
cost effective manner is Hadoop MapReduce. In order to effectively utilize any computational platform, 
information about the components affecting its performance is necessary. Similarly, Hadoop MapReduce’s 
performance can be enhanced by identifying those factors that can affect its performance. Some researchers 
provided some schemes for improving total task completion time of big data tasks on Hadoop MapReduce 
by suitable selection and scheduling of processing units i.e. mappers. However, reducers are still 
underexplored for its effect on the total execution time. This paper aimed at evaluation of reducer’s impact 
on total execution time of big data tasks on Hadoop MapReduce by employing machine learning techniques. 
The evaluation has been carried out both analytically and experimentally by changing different number of 
reducers across various types and length of tasks. The results clearly depicts the dependence of total 
MapReduce task execution time on the number of reducers. 
 
Keywords 
Big Data, Machine learning, Hadoop MapReduce, total execution time. 
 
1. Introduction 
The present era has witnessed a dramatic change in scientific frontiers. A plethora of developments have occurred 
in digital technologies like, social media and networks, financial transactions, sensor’s data business and financial 
dealings and person to person communications via digital platforms. These developments resulted in the generation of 
massive amount of data termed as “Big Data”. The data can be in various forms like, pictures, text, xml, sound, social 
context, video and so on (Koutroumpis, Leiponen, & Thomas, 2017). The challenge here is the storage, processing and 
analysis of tremendously growing amount of data by utilizing traditional databases and conventional tools and schemes. 
This challenge has aroused the need for processing, storing and investigating the large bulk of data in almost all fields 
with the help of smart and efficient platforms and techniques. In addition, shrinking time to analyze the growing amount 
of data and the information about time estimation for tasks execution over the computational resources is the biggest 
challenge faced by both researchers and industrialists.

6. Conclusion 
 
Hadoop MapReduce has been considered as the promising and acceptable platform for big data tasks processing. 
Hadoop MapReduce has many configuration parameters and their optimal tuning can significantly increase total task 
completion time of big data tasks on  Hadoop MapReduce. In this paper, an underexplored factor that is the number of 
reducers is evaluated for its effect on overall task execution time of Big data tasks in Hadoop MapReduce. Several 
simulations has been done by different number of reducers and also by varying the input data sizes. It has been observed 
that the variation of the number of reducers influences the total tasks execution time. The results from the Fig. 6 depicts 
that changing the number of reducers has a significantly effect on total completion time for particular values. As shown 
in Figure 6 that by increasing the number of reducers with varying the input data sizes has follows a trend line which 
shows a dip for each input or task. But the value of the reducer that is, the number of reducers showing the best execution 
time for each input data size is different. In addition, Machine learning technique that is, Regression has been used for 
the qualifying criteria. The evaluation results evidently shows the dependence of the total execution time on the number 
of reducers. The results are also validated through regression analysis p-value. From the Table II we can see that p-
value is greater than 0.05 which means replication factor contributes as major to total completion time. Consequently, 
it has a substantial effect on overall performance of the Hadoop MapReduce also.

Abstract 
Social e-commerce are considered to play important roles in creates connection between product and 
community. This research tried to formulate the strategic management for the social e-commerce when they 
have to face the global economic challenge and to be more competitive. A case study was conducted in the 
biggest and only one social e-commerce in Indonesia. This social e-commerce provides the biggest virtual 
community in Indonesia which have many forum and also trading forum. The social e-commerce has 
several problems, such as how to get competence in human resources, improving infrastructure, the next 
action for trading forum and to gain trust of customer again. To accomplish that problem, it should tried to 
formulate the strategic management through a combination of SWOT and PESTLE analysis. The SWOT 
analysis consists of four elements, i.e., strength, weakness, opportunities, threat. On the other hand, 
PESTLE analysis have six variables, i.e., political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environment. 
Researchers hope that the strategic management which has been formulated could be used by the social e-
commerce to help the social e-commerce to handle the aforementioned problems.

Introduction 
Today, internet is as an instrument for business famous for e-commerce. E-commerce is the main alternative to develop 
effective and efficient business (Ismarani, 2014). In the other hand, e-commerce cosists of social e-commerce. Social-
commerce is representative from Web 2.0. It is gives information by one person to others (monolog media) or by 
people to others (social media monolog). Some examples of Web 2.0 social media sites include blogs, web forums, 
virtual communities, and social networks (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). In the social e-commerce, there are a lot of 
problems such as how to get competence in human resources, improving infrastructure, the next action for trading 
forum, and to gain trust of customer gain. Therefore, this study focused on solution to solve the problem by strategic 
management. 
There has been a movement toward thinking of strategic management for over the past decades; it is not just a function 
to develop an organization, but it is more as a set of values and processes to facing global competition. The role of 
management is too important to be ignored since it has a vital position in organize its position in market. Strategic 
management is the process of evaluation, planning, and implementation designed to maintain or improve competitive 
advantage (Cooper, 2014). The process of evaluation is concerned with assessment of the external and internal 
environments. This research tried to formulate a strategic management through SWOT analysis and combine it with 
PESTLE analysis. PESTLE analysis is strategic planning tool to expand on the external context by looking in detail 
at specific types of issues that frequently have an impact on company, i.e., political, economic, social, technological, 
environmental and legal factors (Kolios & Read, 2013). In order to exhibit the applicability of the proposed methods, 
a case study has been conducted in one of the bigger social e-commerce in Indonesia. Social e-commerce in Indonesia 
has revenue about Rp 100 billion in 2015, but it has 28 million visitors per month that is 700 million page accessed 
and around 4,000 threads created in daily basis (Shona, 2016).

In order to be more competitive in facing global competition, the social e-commerce is required to change its 
conventional management. Based on the interview with the expert and user of social e-commerce, the social e-
commerce has several problems, such as how to get competence human resources, improving infrastructure, the next 
action for trading forum and to gain trust of customer again. In this research trying to help the social e-commerce to 
update its strategic management through a combination of SWOT and PESTLE analysis. The SWOT analyze based 
on  internal and external aspect. It is consist strength, weakness, opportunities, and threat. The result of SWOT analysis 
is depicted in table 3. The PESTLE have six elements, i.e., political, economic, social, technologies, legal, 
environment. Table 4 shown the developing of OS strategies. The strategy could be used to manage the aforementioned 
problems. 
 
Conclusion 
In this research using SWOT analysis and combine it with PESTLE analysis to formulate a strategic management. It 
was then applied to social e-commerce so that the social e-commerce can improve its business power and be more 
competitive. Monitoring and controlling of the proposed strategies have to be conducted in order to assess the 
effectiveness of the strategies. However, for a future research, the social e-commerce can evaluate based on its service 
quality.

Abstract 
Generalized Space Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model was used to model the time series data that had correlation 
inter-location (space time). In the stage of model identification, spatial weight on GSTAR model shown relations of 
inter-location, which were weight normalized cross-correlation, binary, uniform, and inverse of distance. Data 
grouping uses the CLARANS (Clustering Large Application based on Randomized Search) Cluster analysis method, 
which is a clustering method that involves spatial elements by determining the number of clusters at the beginning 
where each object has the opportunity to be selected as a cluster center. The data used was secondary data of Farmer 
Exchange Rates in 32 provinces for 71 months from year 2005 to 2013, which has been obtained from the Economic 
Indicators published by BPS every month. Model candidates that have been obtained of the data were GSTAR(1;1) 
and GSTAR(2;1;1).

follow: 
a. 
The Role of Matrix Weight The location at the identification stage of the model is to see how much correlation 
each neighbor has to a location. The Location Weight Matrix also plays a role in checking stationary and 
identifying candidates for the Generalized Space-Time Autoregressive (GSTAR) model. 
b. Model candidates for Farmer Exchange Rate data include GSTAR (1; 1) and GSTAR (2; 1.1).

Abstract 
Multicollinearity is the condition that there is a correlation between independent variables which is a problem. This 
event often occurs in regression analysis. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method 
regression can reduce multicollinearity and increase the accuracy of linear regression models. The lasso parameter 
estimator can be solved by the LARS (Least Angle Regression and Shrinkage) algorithm which calculates the 
correlation vector, the largest absolute correlation value, equiangular vector, inner product vector, and determines 
the LARS algorithm limiter for LASSO. LASSO method regression with a more detailed procedure and selecting the 
best model using the 𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝 Mallows statistics is discussed in this paper. LASSO method will be applied to Indonesia's 
foreign exchange deposit data.

1. Introduction
Correlation in regression analysis is correlation with the aim to predict the value of non-independent variables
based on the independent variables. In fact, a correlation between variables does not only consist of two variables, but 
there can be a correlation between three or more variables called multiple linear regression (Permai and Tanty, 2018)

Model Regresi dari Metode LASSO Regression 
Based on Table 4 and Table 5 can be obtained the model of LASSO method as follows: 
Y෡= −0.077358603X1 −0.14037599X2 + 0.104015412X3 + 0.013263973X4 
The meaning of the model above is if net foreign assets increase by one trillion, the value of Indonesia's 
foreign exchange deposits will decrease by 0.077358603 or 7.7358603%. As with net domestic assets, if there is an 
increase of one trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits will decrease by 0.14037599 or 
1.4037599%. Different from the net bill to the central government, if it experiences an increase of one trillion, the 
value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposit will increase by 0.104015412 or 1.04015412%. While bills to other 
sectors, if there is an increase of one trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits will increase by 
0.013263973 or 1.3263973%. 
 
4. Conclusions  
 
In this paper we have analyzed the LASSO method parameter can be specified with LARS algorithm which 
calculates correlation vector, the largest absolute correlation value, equiangular vector, inner product vector, and 
determines the LARS algorithm limiter for LASSO. The model of LASSO method as follows:  
 
Y෡= −0.077358603X1 −0.14037599X2 + 0.104015412X3 + 0.013263973X4 
 
Base on model if net foreign assets increase by one trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits 
will decrease by 0.077358603 or 7.7358603%. As with net domestic assets, if there is an increase of one trillion, the 
value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits will decrease by 0.14037599 or 1.4037599%. Different from the net 
bill to the central government, if it experiences an increase of one trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange 
deposit will increase by 0.104015412 or 1.04015412%. While bills to other sectors, if there is an increase of one 
trillion, the value of Indonesia's foreign exchange deposits will increase by 0.013263973 or 1.3263973%.

Abstract 
KM ALUMUNIUM is one of the manufacturing company that produce household appliance such as frying pan and 
bread mold using aluminium as its basic material. KM ALUMUNIUM always producing every day following the 
customer order. According to the observation and interview result towards the owner and the workers, obtained that 
the facility layout on the shop floor is not good enough, it causes difficulty to the workers when doing material 
handling activities that makes productivity to becomes low. To redesign the facility layout, ARC (Activity 
Relationship Chart) and ARD (Activity Relationship Diagram) methods are used and it was implemented on computer 
simulation model using Flexsim 6.0 to see how much the improvement could be applied. It is obtained that the cause 
of bad facility layout is the finished warehouse location and finishing process location is not corresponding to the 
production flow so that it makes the frequency of workers delivering goods to be higher. By swapping the finished 
warehouse to the finishing process location and simulated for 1 workday, it is obtained that the material handling cost 
is reduced as many as 55,22% and the production output is increased by 25 products.

1. Introduction
According to the World Economic Forum (2017) report related to Global Competitiveness Index 2017-2018, Industrial 
Competitiveness in Indonesia ranked 36 from 137 nations, it could be improved by increasing the productivity of 
industry so that the company can compete. Efforts to increase productivity in manufacturing companies have many 
ways, one of the way is facility layout design. 
According to Wignjosoebroto (2003), facility layout can be defined as the procedure for arranging factory facilities to 
support the smooth production process. The arrangement will utilize the area for the placement of machines or other 
production support facilities, the smooth movement of material, storage of material both temporary and permanent, 
workers and so on. The purpose of facility planning is to minimize material handling cost through effective regulation 
and coordination of physical facilities and to regulate safe and comfortable production operation facilities so as to 
increase performance of workers (Wignjosoebroto 2003). 
KM ALUMINUM is one of the manufacturing companies engaged in manufacturing household appliances with a 
production base made of aluminium metal. The products produced are various but still within the scope of household 
appliances and the products most often ordered are pans and bread molds. The type of production used is make to 
order, where production is carried out if there are orders from customers. Every day, KM ALUMINUM always 
produces because of the many orders from customers, especially for pan and bread mold. 
Based on the result of observation and interviews with the owner and workers of KM ALUMINUM, there were several 
problems including the distance of material movement between work stations which caused workers to get tired easily 
due to goods delivery activities without adding value to the product so that it also impacts on the amount of production 
costs caused by material handling and the amount of output produced, because 20-75% of production costs are caused 
by material handling (Tompkins et al. 2003). Therefore, redesigning the facility layout needs to be done on KM

It can be seen that the material handling cost is decreased from $ 23,646.34 to $ 11,060.73 so that the decline was        
$ 12,585.61 or 55.22%. In addition, the proposed layout is also able to make production output increase to 540 (520 
products are already in the finished warehouse, while 20 products are still in the temporary storage that have not been 
delivered to the finished warehouse) which was originally 515 (increased by 25 products).

4. Conclusion 
 
The conclusion of this study is that poor layout causes high material handling costs which means high frequency of 
workers in delivering goods. The cause of poor layout in KM ALUMINIUM is that the location of finished warehouse 
and finishing process does not match with the production flow causing high frequency of workers in delivering goods 
(backtracking), this is also included excessive transportation waste in lean manufacturing concepts that must be 
eliminated. By exchanging the location of the finished warehouse with the finishing process, the material handling 
cost changed from $23,646.34 to $11,060.73 so that the decrease was $12,585.61 or as much as 55.22%. In addition, 
there was also an increase in output of 25 products, which initially 515 products became 540 products.

Abstract 
Mobile Learning Application (MLA) is an accommodating technology to instructors wherein their lessons and other 
usable features in teaching can be done and applied online. In the Philippines, the application of this technology seems 
to be still lacking, most especially among high school students in government-owned institutions. At present, the 
subject of this study uses an online application to help senior high school students focusing on accounting and business 
management to review and understand their lessons further. Based from the SUS survey, the current mobile application 
utilized has a computed mean score of 55.25%, which is below the 68% marginal average scale for a usable system. 
This study aims to identify the statistically-significant variables affecting the usability of a mobile learning application 
to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness in improving the user experience of the students. Recommendations in this 
study uses the significant variables in creating an ergonomically-designed mobile learning application that will 
improve its user effectiveness and its usability to be utilized as a student-centered academic learning portal.

1. Introduction
In the Philippines, a vast amount of senior high school enrolments were recorded nationwide, with over one million 
students are expected annually to enter in government-owned schools [1]. Out of the possible enrolments in this sector, 
Accounting and Business Management (ABM) is the third most considered senior high school strand with recorded 
219,313 enrollees [2]. ABM strand gives an understanding in relation to fields such as marketing, economics, 
accountancy, and business management. ABM strand helps senior high school students be more familiar in what they 
may face before entering college and working in the corporate industry.  
Senior High School education in the Philippines is starting to integrate technology-based education to the usual 
teaching method. As technology advances, schools have adopted the utilization of gadgets such as smartphones as a 
teaching tool which comprises mobile learning applications relative to the needs of the user. Mobile Learning 
Application (MLA) is one of the tools that was used in the Philippines to facilitate the learning of the students. In 
connection, the usability of the mobile learning application is one of the key factors in order to meet the satisfaction 
of users. Quality of the system can affect the User Experience (UX) satisfaction in which gives a user-friendly User 
Interface (UI). 
The study will focus on the usability evaluation of a mobile learning application intended for business management 
senior high school students in the Philippines. Based on the computed mean of SUS questionnaire, the current mobile

Abstract 
Higher education institutions today operate in an environment characterized, among other factors, by limited financial 
resources, stringent academic accreditation requirements, and heightened student expectations in terms of the expected 
time-to-degree, convenience/flexibility, and variety of choice in course offerings. In this talk, we investigate heuristic 
approaches for planning an appropriate mix of future courses to be offered in non-lockstep programs. Subject to a 
maximum time limit, such programs permit students to take alternative pathways and timelines to the degree based on 
their personal interests, time and cost pressures, and workplace or family commitments. Assuming that a long-range 
plan for course cycling is already in place at the institution, this paper solely focuses on techniques to modify such 
plans for the near-term based on an analysis of the progress of currently active cohorts with regard to time (delay) and 
cost (overrun).  Using novel definitions of the well-known project performance measures (earned value, planned value, 
and actual cost) applicable to the educational context, we derive estimates of expected time-to-degree and expected 
cost for each cohort.  Based on these computations, we are able to recommend guidelines for heuristically adjusting 
the long-range course cycling plan.

Abstract 
This paper presents the case study of Ayamas Food Cooperation Sdn. Bhd. (AFC), focusing on the company strategy 
for its supply chain management (SCM). The data was gathered from the company’s official website and related 
documents retrieved early in the year (2018). The overall information of the strategy was identified from these main 
segments of SCM: supplier, manufacturer and distribution up to retailer / customer. The types of food product were 
clearly categorized and many of them were highly demanded as fast-moving items. The SCM strategy across these 
segments is crucial and therefore communication system is emphasized not only for efficiency purposes, but also 
responding to the reactive demand. It is identified that there is a clear competitive advantage (CA) strategy for AFC. 
Although AFC is performing well as indicated by the manufacturing volume, this paper identifies a gap in terms of 
logistics and distribution. This paper also presents some proposal for improvement.

1. Introduction
Ayamas Food Cooperation (AFC) is the first company in Malaysia to breed, process and retail halal chicken-based 
products (Soong, 2007). It processes 100,000 birds per day to supply to both local and international markets including 
Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei, Hong Kong and the Middle East (Salim, Zakaria, Hassan, & Zia, 2016). AFC promises 
its consumers to produce high quality halal products that it spends over RM5 million on research and development 
annually to fulfil its commitment (Soong, 2007). In addition, it has ISO 9002 certification and is in the process of 
obtaining the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) as an integral part of quality assurance to the 
market. AFC guarantees all its products are halal since it has 100% control at each and every stage of its’ processes 
ranging from breeding, hatching, slaughtering, processing, packaging and distribution (Hashim, 2010). It owns 
hatcheries to ensure halal quality from eggs to chicks, breed chicks in a close air conditioned and contained system 
that chicks are isolating from unclean materials and uses halal feed for the entire system. It also owns abattoirs that 
functions according to Department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) setting standards and processing plant 
that produces halal chicken products. Moreover, AFC developed a Syariah Advisory Council consisting of 
distinguished and prominent religious scholars from Islamic institutions that act as an advisory body to advise it on 
all halal matters relating to its’ business. It also maintains close relationships with JAKIM to ensure consistency of 
producing halal products (Mohtar, Amirnordin, & Haron, 2014). 
In this paper, a thematic review of AFC is undertaken to review its SCM development. The data was gathered from 
the company’s official website and related documents retrieved early in the year (2018). The overall information of 
the strategy was identified from the main segments of SCM: supplier, manufacturer and distribution up to retailer / 
customer.  This paper identifies a gap in terms of logistics and distribution even though AFC is performing well as 
indicated by its manufacturing volume. The paper also presents some proposal for improvement, as well as the supply 
chain strategy.

of the warehouse is of essence to store all stocks before going to be transported to customers. It is also a place where 
all inventory documentations are made to make sure all stocks are in specific quantity and in good condition.  
 
Two types of warehouses, which are public (rented facility) and private (owned facility) warehouses, were identified. 
The advantages of the private warehouse are such as offering maximization storage of stocks which enable them to 
fulfil demands at any time plus that having the flexibility of time in utilising the warehouses. Total of the fixed cost 
shall also be reduced since no expiry period of using the facilities of the warehouses. However, there are disadvantages 
of owning warehouses since bigger capital expenditure need to be borne by the company. This may also include the 
costs of utilities and taxes. 
 
Ayamas additionally has items such as Ayamas Crispy Fried Chicken, Ayamas Premium Cheese Frankfurter and 
Ayamas Premium Black Pepper Frankfurter. Most of the distribution centers claimed by AFC are refrigerated. 
Therefore, as optimal solution, Ayamas supplies more than 1,000 coolers to shops and retail outlets in rural regions 
throughout the nation. This is critical to encourage big quantities of raw chicken meats, which was previously handled 
or sent to the eateries. Cool stockpiling is expected to secure the nature of the meats by keeping the development of 
microscopic organisms on the crude materials. In this way, the meats will be protected to be consumed after being 
prepared (Shazalli & Lancendorfer, 2013) 
 
7. Recommendations and Conclusions 
 
For improvement, the importance of these three factors need to be emphasized, i.e. flow of material, flow of financial 
and flow of information. The flow of material and financial is much affected by the effective and efficient information 
flow. Information sharing between all stakeholders will enable specific CA strategies for SCM be planned. The flow 
of information must be accurate and at speed, particularly in the current environment of Industry 4.0 (IR4.0). 
Technology in informatics and Internet of Things are there for Ayamas to explore and exploit, leading to solutions in 
logistics between suppliers, manufacturers and distributors. For proper monitoring, database system needs to be 
developed for records, information sharing, and safer data security, fast and accurate. For example, the BigFarm Net 
Manager database is a software that can be used in developing ‘smart poultry’, which is aligned with the development 
of IR4.0 (Zhu, Anagondahalli, & Zhang, 2017). This would also enable the company to monitor and control not only 
the SCM but the processes at the poultry or farmhouse, like the house atmosphere in controlling and monitoring the 
settings of water, light, and other requirements suited to the customers. The use of the latest system covers all aspects 
of poultry supplies, manufacturers and distributors, whereas all the information on the number of poultry, poultry care, 
the delivery of raw chicken to the factory, and the delivery of the product to the customer could be properly and 
optimally managed. The system can also be developed to collect the customer's feedback.  
 
The strategies for competitive advantage include differentiation, speed and cost leadership, which in this case, AFC 
adopts the differentiation strategy. In the supply section, costs, better cost control, and the capacity to supply the quick 
growing open poultry demand for the local and abroad market are taken care of. Their handling plants process poultry 
for eateries all through KFC Holding, and spotlight on accomplishing cost-proficiency while keeping up halal and 
amazing gauges.  
 
Meanwhile, in the manufacturing segment, customers’ preferences need to be alerted by AFC, even though the 
varieties of chicken-based products were already insight of Ayamas. That is because, change in trend and new recipe 
demand is part of the culture not only for local people, but must also cater for the global markets.   
 
In the distribution section, there are several measures that could be adopted for instance from Europe, where several 
refrigerated warehouses are already built with eco-friendly technology. This kind of warehouse releases no cfc gases 
which will contribute to better environment. If AFCB uses this type of warehouse, they are not just doing their social 
responsibility but also encourages other company to do the same thing, thus, Malaysia will be a better place to live in. 
Additionally, another type of modern warehouse is one which is attached with solar panels to the roof. Using solar 
energy will help AFC to reduce its cost in warehousing especially about reducing the electricity bill. 
 
Finally, AFC should aware that information sharing is important in supply chain management between three (3) 
segments, i.e. supplier, manufacturer and distribution until to customer or retailer. Smoothness and accuracy flow of 
information will affect the flow of material and financial in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract 
Wastewater from paint manufacturing concerns can be very harmful to the ecosystem if not effectively managed. 
Discharge of such water into the environment can pose danger to plants and animals. In an attempt to combat the 
problem, an intensive study has been conducted in this paper to optimize the effectiveness of wastewater management, 
through exploration of alternative treatment resources. Data was sourced from an existing wastewater treatment plant 
of a Paint manufacturing Company at the Mpumalanga Province, East of South Africa. The plant is currently using 
lime as a coagulant and an electrolyte as a flocculent. Use of new Chemical reagents- Ferric chloride and Aluminum 
Chlorohydrate were investigated it the laboratory. Both of the reagents explored gave better results that what obtains 
with lime. While the existing and newly introduced reagents proved to be useful in controlling the wastewater, the 
Ammonium Chlorohydrate demonstrated stronger reduction capabilities in most of the wastewater indices tested.

Introduction
The study, investigate methodologies to conduct an optimization in the operations of existing wastewater treatment 
facilities in a paint manufacturing industry. Municipal Quality officers have several times discovered components of 
paint that has been discharged in municipal drains. This trend threatens human health and the entire ecosystem. The 
discharge of such wastewater into the environment impedes light penetration in water; which reduces Photosynthesis 
to aquatic vegetation. Contaminated water can generally be toxic to aquatic life and to the entire food chain of 
organisms. Humans can become victims while drinking or using unhealthy water in the attempt to accommodate the 
changing environment (Debnath, et al. 2006). The traces of mismanaged Paint wastewater detection in the ecosystem 
is an evidence that the existing technology still need to be reviewed and improved to the most optimum level as much 
as possible. Scientific methodologies had long been suggested in the wastewater treatment Industry. A number of 
paint production companies have inefficient wastewater treatment plants with a percentage of untreated effluent 
discharged in municipal drains. Blends of all the little percentages of the poisonous substances that are being 
discharged in rivers can result in bioaccumulation and splendid proportion of the entire water impurities (Dipark, 
2017). The eventual consequence of the trend can be an outbreak of diseases, and Some Animal species becoming 
extinct in the ecosystem. Some of the diseases can be both strange, untraceable and chronic. The manufacturing sector 
has begun advancing prevailing processes by introducing substitute material that can replaced previous ones with a 
view to optimizing product quality. Activities of that nature is not out of place if properly applied to advancement of 
wastewater treatment techniques. Certainly, new products come with new problems, hence requires continuous 
improvement. Some processes in the manufacturing sector, especially pollutant discharges constitute threats to the 
ecosystem. As an interim response, the ISO 14001 and 2015 has to be obeyed by all manufacturing Industries, while 
research into the achievement of zero pollutant continues.

Conclusion 
 
This study has satisfied the cleavage of presenting possible resource optimization for wastewater management in paint 
manufacturing plants. An illustrative example case of a Paint manufacturing Plant located at Mpumalanga Province, 
East of South Africa have been set. The results of experimental investigation were displayed in clear figures to remove 
any form of ambiguity. The  Aluminum chloride dosage was 25ppm, and the Ferric Chloride dosage was 120ppm. 
Ferric Chloride can work efficiently on a Batch process and may require two settling tanks because its floccs settle a 
bit slower than the Aluminum Chlorohydrate, while Aluminum Chlorohydrate can work in a continous process and 
may require one settling tank because it generate floccs settle very fast. The overall quality of wastewater from the 
treatment plant can be optimised using the procedure described in this paper. The methodologies followed during the 
research can be implemented in wastewater treatment facilities of other spheres. However, we recommend that a 
settling tank can be installed for evacuation of the resulting floccs.

Abstract 
 
The problem solving, especially in the manufacturing sector has a very diverse and rich background. Be it the Ford 
era or the Bell's lab where Dr. Shewart developed the Statistical Process Control (SPC) or the epic 1950 research by 
NASA for development of Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (PFMEA), the problem-solving approach has taken leaps 
and have stretched to become an essential function and role of any successful manufacturing industry. Today, the 
survival of any corporate entity would be difficult and would be full of Risk, if, the problem solving is not an integral 
part of their ecosystem. In the manufacturing industry, problem-solving was used to be done as soon as an 
abnormality/failure/defect has been found or introduced. The team used to do the root cause analysis using why-why 
analysis, fish-bone methodology or 8D problem-solving approach etc. Such methodologies are very strong and still 
are used very efficiently. If the scale of the problem is very large or it is chronic problem, then strategies like Six 
Sigma, Total Quality Management, Lean Manufacturing or Total Productive Maintenance are also used. Now through 
Kaizens, Poka-Yoke and other approaches, problem-solving have seen a phase shift from reactive to a preventive one. 
The problem is now being prevented even before the occurrence. 
 
The concern and a question over these strategies and methodologies are that these are meant to be for everyone and 
here, everyone means every type of industry irrespective of their market and size. They can be large, medium, small 
or even micro-enterprise. Large enterprises can afford to do all the quality training, up-gradation and they can also 
spend on automation. Even medium enterprises can also bear those expenses for a while but what about those small 
and micro-enterprises. Most of the supply-chain of OEM manufacturing industries are medium, small and micro-
enterprises. Largely the quality of the final product is also the responsibility of the supply chain. How these enterprises 
will be able to cater to such increasing quality needs and dimension? How will they be able to become a problem-
solving enterprise without investing much on this front? 
 
The answer to this is the ""Red-Bin Analysis"". It is a different problem-solving methodology based on quality control 
circle method focusing on the problem occurrence, detection and solving at the source of generation. This method 
highlights and explains the problem selection and its solution which is very efficient in case of problem-solving of 
sub-assemblies or sub-components at the supply chain tier-1, tier-2 or tier-3 level.

Abstract 
Manufacturing industry that produces various plastic packaging products experience high frequency of machine 
breakdowns that consequently cause tardiness in completing orders. Based on importance, orders are given different 
weights of priorities. The earliest due date rule method that is currently used for production scheduling, is causing 
delays in multiple job completions, increasing average tardiness. Currently, both corrective maintenance and 
production scheduling are planned separately, even though both are intertwined. Given the strong correlation 
between the two, this study seeks to integrate preventive maintenance and production scheduling to generate 
production schedules that can minimize the mean weighted expected tardiness. Data processing starts by identifying 
machines with highest downtime value and identifying critical machine components that are causing downtimes. 
Based on data collection and processing, Injection Machine 650-ton has the highest down time. By calculating 
Preventive Maintenance, we obtain time intervals for inspection and preventive replacements for each component. 
Following that, orders are sorted using single machine scheduling, resulting in a mean weighted expected tardiness 
of 78 hours. By integrating preventive maintenance and production scheduling, the mean weighted expected 
tardiness resulted in 43 hours. After using genetic algorithm, the mean weighted expected tardiness further declines 
to 32 hours. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
1.1. Background 
Competition in fulfilling customer demands are ever increasing in the manufacturing industry, driving company’s 
production targets upward. Production scheduling and preventive maintenance (PM) are two subjects that have been 
seriously researched to support innovations and advancements in the manufacturing industry. While the two are 
planned and calculated in isolation, both are highly correlated. Preventive maintenances take time thus affecting the 
available time for production. However, undermining the importance of preventive maintance can be detrimental as 
it will increase the probability of machine failures.  
Typically, production schedules are often interrupted by equipment failures, which could be prevented by 
proper preventive maintenance. However, in order to expedite production, recommended PM intervals are 
often delayed. Despite the trade-offs between the two activities, they are typically planned and executed 
independently in real manufacturing settings even if manufacturing productivity can be improved by 
optimizing both production scheduling and PM planning decisions simultaneously. A vast number of studies 
have been conducted in these two areas in past decades. Nevertheless, almost all relevant studies considered 
production scheduling and PM planning as two independent problems and therefore solve them separately. 
Only a few studies have tried to combine both problems to solve them simultaneously. Cassady and 
Kutanoglu (2003) developed an integrated mathematical model for a single machine problem with total

Calculation of the company’s mean weighted tardiness at the initial stage was 77.959 hours (using EDD scheduling 
rule and without any PM, causing breakdowns). The integration of PM into job scheduling using genetic algorithm 
resulted in a mean weighted expected tardiness of 32.0623 hours.  
  
We arrive at a lower mean weighted expected tardiness post scheduling using genetic algorithm and integrating 
preventive maintenance work due to a lower probability of breakdowns, hence the weighted average of expected 
tardiness also decreases. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Injection Machine 650-ton is the most critical machine with largest downtime percentage of 18%, machine 
inspection time interval of 78 hours and component replacement time interval of 162 hours (nozzle component). The 
current job scheduling method using EDD priority (job sequence 2-1-4-3-6-5) without any preventive maintenance 
(PM) causes average delays of 77.959 hours. 
 
Integrating job scheduling with preventive maintenance resulted in job sequence of 2-1-6-4-5-3 and PMs prior to job 
number 6, 5 and 3. PM is determined by considering time intervals for machine inspection, component replacement 
with the least time interval and non-preemptive production process. Post integration, we arrive at a mean weighted 
expected tardiness of 42.9055 hours. Mean weighted expected tardiness decreases by 44.9% by integrating job 
scheduling and preventive maintenance.  
 
Integrating scheduling with PM using genetic algorithm with job sequence 2-1-4-6-5-3 and PM prior to job number 
4, 5, and 3 resulted in the mean weighted expected tardiness of 32.0623 hours. Using genetic algorithm, mean 
weighted expected tardiness further decreases by 25%.

Abstract 
The application of standards is effective for ensuring the expected function of a system in a specific 
scenario. A key step of the standard enaction or implementation is to precisely comprehend the 
terminologies in the standards via literal comparison. Current methods for such comparison usually rely 
heavily on labor, which is time consuming and error-prone. With the rapid increase in the number of the 
standard documents, it is essential to develop an approach to automatize the comparison process. In this 
work, we proposed a methodology for the computerized comparison of the terms and definitions in 
standards. Based on the standard structures, the methodology is developed in three steps: the PDF (Portable 
Document Format) text conversion, the terms and definitions extraction, and comparison. (1) According to 
the PDF types, either scanned or digitally created, we provided corresponding methods for converting the 
PDF files. (2) Regarding the terms and definitions extraction, we identified content structures and logical 
elements, and extracted definition sections and terms. (3) For the comparison step, we evaluated the 
similarities between the terminologies from the semantic and syntactic aspects. Reliability, availability, 
maintainability, and safety (RAMS) are crucial attributes to evaluate the performance of a system. In the 
experimental studies, we compared the RAMS standards issued by IEC, IEEE, ISO, and the Society for 
Automotive Engineering (SAE). The results show that the proposed methodology is capable of evaluating 
the similarities of the terms and definitions in standards.

Abstract 
In e-commerce businesses, it is common nowadays to showcase products to the users on the basis of analytics 
which can turn those products into potential purchases. However, mostly e-commerce websites recommend only 
similar set of products on the basis of recent search history and not a curated set of products with higher 
confidence level of likeability. Rather than focusing just on a recent search history, if we can utilize social 
media data with this, it can open up a huge pool of data about a user and with this information, we will be able 
to provide well suited recommendations. Our objective in this paper is to develop an algorithm to provide very 
effective recommendations using the social media data of a user. This can help increase the efficiency of 
existing recommendation systems. Algorithm introduced in this paper follows a Fuzzy Logic technique to find 
relevant keywords emanated from Keywords Derivation algorithm which is a necessary algorithm for final 
result. It also makes use of Google Cloud Natural Language API to classify keywords in their respective 
categories. This algorithm is befitting to any products/services as long as the information about products and 
user’s social media data are available.

Introduction
1.1. 
Internet Usage
In our daily life, internet usage is increasing day by day along with social media usage with increasing 
infrastructure and ample available bandwidth. As per report from “We are Social” and “Hootsuite” of 2018, out 
of total population of 7.593 Billion in the world, 4.021 Billion are internet users and out of which 3.196 Billion 
are active social media users. Numbers of internet users are increasing 7% year on year and number of social 
media users are increasing 13% year on year as per 2018 report. 
Figure 1. Key statistical indicators for the world's internet, mobile and social media users 
Average internet users spend approximately 6 hours daily on an average on internet enabled devices and 
services which is approximately 33% of their daily day time.

4.2 Scope 
Algorithm proposed in this paper can be useful for any e-commerce firms eyeing over attracting their users to 
the range of products which are hard to discover. With the use of this algorithm, consumers are very likely to 
find the set of products which are suited to their likeability. An empirical research with users connected with 
Facebook, Linked-in etc. can be carried out to validate the model with large sample size. 
Even though this paper is aimed towards e-commerce mainly, scope of this algorithm can be extended to any 
internet businesses where preferences of users are inevitable in suggesting their services.  
4.3 Conclusion 
 
A primary research carried out on 228 users suggests that nearly 50% of people are either neutral or unsatisfied 
with the current system of recommendations provided. With the use of the social media data of users, the 
algorithm that we have introduced in this paper will be very useful in finding personalized products for the 
users. Analytics being used on social media data can give us insights about users’ interests which are crucial in 
finding the products aligned with their likeability. Concerns shown by the users during our survey were majorly 
on privacy issues related to sharing their profiles which, if can be handled properly, this method will be very 
useful.

There is a tremendous amount of attention being focused on improving human health these days. The World 
Health Organization (WHO) statistics show that disease and mortality rate greatly depend on access to 
proper healthcare, which is not available to a vast majority of the global population. The healthcare 
environment is generally perceived as being ‘information rich’ yet ‘knowledge poor’. The knowledge 
discovery in database (KDD) is alarmed with development of methods and techniques for making use of 
data. One of the most important step of the KDD is the data mining. Data mining is the process of pattern 
discovery and extraction where huge amount of data is involved. The analysis of medical records is a major 
challenge, considering they are generally presented in plain text, have a very specific technical vocabulary, 
and are nearly always unstructured. It is an interdisciplinary work that requires knowledge from several 
fields. The analysis may have several goals, such as assistance on clinical decision, classification of medical 
procedures, and to support hospital management decisions. There is a wealth of data available within the 
healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of effective analysis tools to discover hidden relationships and 
trends in data. Knowledge discovery and data mining have found numerous applications in business and 
scientific domain. Terabytes of data are generated every day in many organizations. To extract hidden 
predictive information from large volumes of data, data mining (DM) techniques are needed. Organizations 
are starting to realize the importance of data mining in their strategic planning and successful application 
of DM techniques can be an enormous payoff for the organizations. Valuable knowledge can be discovered 
from application of data mining techniques in healthcare system. In this study, we briefly examine the 
potential use of classification based data mining techniques such as Rule based, decision tree and Artificial 
Neural Network to massive volume of healthcare data. This paper also discusses the requirements and 
challenges of DM, and describes major DM techniques such as statistics, artificial intelligence, decision 
tree approach, genetic algorithm, and visualization. Knowledge discovery in databases is well-defined 
process consisting of several distinct steps. Data mining is the core step, which results in the discovery of 
hidden but useful knowledge from massive databases. A formal definition of Knowledge discovery in 
databases is given as follows: “Data mining is the non-trivial extraction of implicit previously unknown 
and potentially useful information about data”. Data mining technology provides a user- oriented approach

Abstract 
Organizational culture and students’ satisfaction are among critical factors for any university. Although these 
concepts have attracted considerable interests from both academics and practitioners, there are few studies that 
examine the relationship between them in different culture like Saudi Arabia. Hence, the present study investigates 
influence of organisational culture on students’ satisfaction in Saudi Arabia as well as to evaluate the impact of each 
sub-element of organizational culture on students’ satisfaction. This is due to the belief that the unsatisfied student 
might choose to abandon their study. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the relationship between 
organisational culture dimensions and overall satisfaction. The present study was conducted on 1534 students 
randomly drawn using questionnaire method. The statistical tool used to test the hypothesized model is the structural 
equation modelling with AMOS version 24. The results obtained indicates significant positive impact between 
organisational culture dimensions and students’ satisfaction. The finding showed that out of the four dimensions of 
organizational culture, four have influence on students’ satisfaction. Based on these results it can be said that 
university administration should take into consideration students’ organisational culture as well as their satisfaction 
in order to enhance their academic outcomes.

1. Introduction
For organisations to succeed in attracting customer attention, which in turn, will lead to their survival, they must 
have a supportive culture and set their organisational cultures to become customer-oriented.  Therefore, studies have 
been undertaken on organisational culture and customer satisfaction.  Some of the studies undertaken focused on the 
types and dimensions of organisational culture that result in customer satisfaction.  This aspect was investigated by 
Givarianet al., (2013).  Their study shows that of the four features of organisational culture identified by Schein, 
involvement (team work) has the highest influence on (28%) on customer satisfaction, followed by compatibility 
(27%), mission (23%) and adaptability (22%). 
It has also been argued by Wadajo (2014) that there are certain forms of organisational culture that predict customer 
satisfaction as revealed by the study of the public health sector of Kersa Alligatored. It was found out that customer

among the Saudi students who took part in this study. Furthermore, the structural model assessment as shown in 
Table 2 provides the indication of the hypotheses test, namely estimates, t-values and p-values. According to these 
results, among the four hypotheses in the model, one relationship has turned out to be statistically insignificant. This 
relationship between participation and students’ satisfaction (β= -0.006, t= -0.097, p >0.05). The other three direct 
hypotheses were all statistically significant at the level less than 0.001. These are relationships between consistency 
and students’ satisfaction (β=0.519, t= 5.004, p <0.05), between adaptability and students’ satisfaction (β=0.151, t= 
2.173, p <0.05), and mission and students’ satisfaction (β=0.239, t= 2.835, p <0.05).

5. Conclusion 
 
The results of this study confirmed that organisational culture is positively related to students satisfaction which is 
not surprising as some studies have found the same in different settings as seen in (Saleem et al., 2017; 
Trivellas&Dargenidou, 2009; Mcclelland et al., 2008). However, what makes this study different is conducting it in 
other context with a different culture in Saudi Arabia. Also, this study focused on investigating the effect of 
organizational culture dimensions (participation, consistency, adaptability and mission) on students’ satisfaction. To 
this effect, SEM analysis was employed in the present for the analysis of the related variables and this paper 
provides similar outcomes in which organisational culture significantly and positively predicts student’s satisfaction 
students in their academic context. Hence the outcome of this study supported that better organisational culture 
environment will equally improve the level of satisfaction among Saudi university students. The results showed that 
three organizational culture dimensions (consistency, adaptability and mission) have a significant influence on 
students’ satisfaction. Hence hypotheses 1, 3 and 4 are supported while the second hypothesis regarding the 
participation turned up insignificant effect on students’ satisfaction. The study results provided evidence that 
organizational culture has a strong influence over students’ satisfaction. While organizational culture has so far been 
highly studied in the realm of various other field and subjects, particularly in corporate management, universities are 
yet to embrace it. This study suggests that universities administrators must now pay attention to organizational 
culture as it is reminiscent of their students’ satisfaction and overall institutions performance. On the basis of 
findings of this study this research recommends that university administration should create supportive 
organizational culture in their institutions in order to raise the students’ satisfaction which in turn will influence their 
academic performance and loyalty to the university.

Abstract 
Generalized intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (GIFNs) a special kind intuitionistic fuzzy set on the real number set are 
useful to deal with ill-known quantities in fuzzy optimization problems.  In this paper, we have considered a multi-
objective linear fractional inventory problem with generalized intuitionistic fuzzy environment. By employing the 
possibility measures and expected value, the multi-objective generalized intuitionistic fuzzy linear fractional 
inventory model is transformed into an equivalent deterministic linear fractional programming problem. Finally, the 
model is illustrated with the help of numerical example, and to validate the proposed model few sensitivity analysis 
are also presented under different parameters.

1. Introduction
Fuzzy set theory has been well exhibited and applied in a wide variety of real problems since it was proposed in 
1965 by Zadeh (1965).  Zadeh (1965) expresses the degree of membership of a given element in a fuzzy set, but 
very often does not express the corresponding degree of non-membership as the complement to 1. Thus, Atanassov 
(1986) introduced the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) by adding an additional non-membership function; this may 
express more enormous and supple information as compared with the fuzzy set. The IFS has an eminent 
characteristic which allots to each element a membership degree and a non-membership degree. Intuitionistic fuzzy 
numbers are a special instance of fuzzy numbers. As a generalization of fuzzy Set, the intuitionistic fuzzy number 
(IFN) is a special kind of IFS defined on the real number set, which appears to properly describe an ill-known 
quantity (2006). Recently, Garai et al (2017) proposed the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy number. 
Generally speaking, uncertainty is usual to all real life problems for example fuzziness. Since Zadeh (1965) 
introduced the fuzzy set theory and it has been well developed and applied in a wide variety of real life problems. 
Possibility theory was proposed by Zadeh (1988) and developed by many researchers, e.g. Dubois and Prade (1988) 
Klir (1992 a) Yager (1992 b) and others.  A self dual measure called credibility measure was introduced by Liu and 
Liu [9]. The mean value of a fuzzy number was introduced by Dubois and Prade (1988).  Thereafter, Carlsson and 
Fuller (1992 c) defined a possiblistic mean and variance of fuzzy numbers. The expected value of fuzzy variable 
using possibility theory was proposed by Hilpern (2001) and application of expected value operator called expected 
value model introduced by Liu and Liu (2002). Recently Garai et al. (2018) introduced the possibility mean of a 
generalized intuitionistic fuzzy number and its application multi-item inventory model.

6. Conclusion 
 
As an eminent issue of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, GIFNs are the consistent tools to fleet the fuzzy and uncertain 
quantities with hesitance degrees. In this paper, we have considered linear fractional inventory modelling GIFNs and 
maximize the profit and minimize the holding cost related to per-ordered quantity with some realistic set of 
constraints. The formulated problem solved unless it converted into an equivalent deterministic problem, which has 
been done by using possibility and necessity measures. This model solve using soft computing technique 
generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method (Lingo-14.0). The optimal result of the proposed model given in Table 
2. The model can be further extended many ways for example inventory production related costs considered as 
exponential, hyperbolic, etc.  fuzzy numbers.

Abstract 
This paper considers a difficult of dynamic match inner-tool election and distribution of operation with 
part and tool movement policies in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) environment. For this design, 
a novel 0-1 Non linear integer programming multi objective model is demonstrated in such a way that 
each tool and each part can move during the production phase. It is assumed that there are sets of tools 
and machines that can manufacture different kinds of orders (or part types). Therefore, in this study, we 
make use of one of the various objective decision-making methods, a global criterion approach, to 
improve a multi-objective model for find a solution FMS scheduling problems with payment of two 
performance measures, namely minimum machining cost, set up cost as first objective and minimum 
machining time, tools and parts transportation time and machines average idle time as second objective, at 
the same time. SMOSA algorithm approach is applied to optimize the model and the outcomes of the 
computational experiments are reported.

1. Introduction and Literature review
Producing a given set of part types each one with many operations and different alternative machine-tool 
combinations is very significant in any flexible manufacturing system (FMS). A flexible manufacturing system 
(FMS) plans at attaining the efficiency of automated high-volume mass production while keep the flexibility of low-
volume work shop production. In recent years, an increasing request for customized products has made an extreme 
increase in the number of options and product changes. Traditionally, the product different demanded by customers 
has been produced in a work shop or small batch activities. There are two great kinds of tool allocation in an FMS, 
namely part motion policy and tool motion policy. Scheduling in an FMS environment is more complicated and hard 
than in a conventional manufacturing environment. Production scheduling for an FMS can be treated as four sub-
difficulties: (1) part type selection, (2) machine loading, (3) part input sequencing, and (4) operation scheduling 
(Sawik 1990). In this article, we focus the entire approach on the operation scheduling which evaluate the detailed 
schedule for processing the works in the system. Previous studies of operation scheduling problems related to FMSs 
can be organized into two categories: optimization procedure for an exact explanation and heuristic algorithms for 
near optimal solutions Adams et al. (1988); improved a model and a solution protocol for the machine loading and 
tool allocation problem in FMS. Kim and Yano (1993) offer a number of methods for loading problems in flexible 
manufacturing systems; Kim and Yano (1994), and displayed how an existing branch-and-bound algorithm for the

Size in the original algorithm results in a situation called stagnation. While a very low value of POP Size results in 
little information conveying rom previous solutions and the algorithm becomes a randomized greedy search 
procedure. A study of POP Size behavior is done with set of values {100,150,200,250,300}. A value of 100 for POP

6 . Conclusion 
This paper considers the machine–tool selection and operation allocation problem and exhibits the effectiveness of 
the MOSA algorithm to address the same. The objective taken into account are to determine the optimal 
combinations for the machine and tool for operations keeping in mind the minimization of various costs; namely, 
machining cost, set-up cost ,part  transportation cost between machines , tools handling cost and average machines 
idle time . The constraint posed by the system are pertaining to tool life, tool magazine capacity and machining time. 
The proposed model is optimized by MOSA algorithm. Some of the salient features of this work can be enlisted as 
follows: 
1. This paper applies the concept of Multi objective to address problems close to real-life industrial scenarios. 
2. The application of meta – heuristic proves be better than integer programming formulation in terms of solution 
quality for the real-life problems of large size. 
3. The parameters for the MOSA-based approach have been selected in a manner that computational time and 
solution quality may remain optimal.

Abstract 
X Ltd. is a manufacturing company that produces office furniture, such as table, drawer, and office cabinet. Main 
raw material of office furniture products by X Ltd. is particle board. Errors in decision making in particle board 
supplies can affect the production cycle which has an impact on increasing waste, cost, and decreasing profit. The 
right decision-making analysis using the system dynamics model can help logistics manager in determining the right 
strategy in achieving optimal results while increasing company profits and minimizing costs. The AME calculation 
for model validation produces a value of 14.74% (raw material stock ready), 14.79% (customer demand), 4.65% 
(finished goods), and 7.48% (profit). The results of the system dynamics model simulation found that scenario 1 is 
the best decision scenario for company with average growth rates for raw materials of ready stock amounting to 644 
pcs-2125 pcs, customer demand of 256 pcs-408 pcs, finished goods of 43 pcs-977 pcs, and profit of Rp. 
794,879,346.00-Rp. 1,841,444,136.00.

1. Introduction
Global furniture industries face difficulties in determining decision or policies that are faced with intence 
competition between furniture industries. The high level of competition between industries affect the determination 
of the company's warehouse inventory (Richard, 2012). Many industries will need optimal results according to the 
lack of knowledge and data on raw materials that need to be analyzed.  
X Ltd. is a furniture manufacturing company that uses various raw materials to produce office furniture, one of raw 
material which is Particle Board (PB). X Ltd. produces many variations of products with a number of fluctuating 
sales from A-Class product to S-Class product. X Ltd. as a creative industry with a changing level of production 
makes it difficult in the decision-making process related to detemine optimal amount of raw materials. 
Problem that found in X Ltd. is the frequent occurrence of errors in decision making related to the process of 
determine the optimal amount of raw materials. Based on the stock particle board data in X Ltd., the stock of PLM 
012-200-PB types of particle board in April 2018 and June 2018 can’t require the production requirement with stock
numbers minus 11 units and 4 units, therefore logistics need to place an order suddenly. If this problem recurs, it can
cause an increase in costs due to sudden ordering of raw materials, increased waste as a result of improper raw
material stocks, and a decrease in profits due to production that is delayed or cannot be fulfilled. Therefore, it is
necessary to do a simulation using the system dynamics model to determine the right strategy for the optimal
decision on raw material inventory in order to answer various problems in the company.

7.   Conclusion 
Researchers produced conclusions and suggestions for the  management of X Ltd.. Based on the analysis and 
discussion presented in the previous chapter, wecan conclude some of the following: 
1. The BAU condition of X Ltd. management system projection model shows that in 2017-2018, X Ltd. 
experienced a decrease in the company's profit level of Rp 788,340,648.00 (starting from Rp 4,717,927,337.00 
(in 2017) to Rp 3,929,586,689, 00 (in 2018)). The finished good level has steadily increased from 2015 to 2017 
by 2057 pcs (in 2015) to 4656 pcs (in 2017) following the fulfillment of fluctuating customer demand of 2200 
pcs (in 2015) to 3169 pcs (in 2017). Decreasing company profits in the period 2017 to 2018 causes company 
needs to simulate and design new alternative strategies to overcome problems, and increase output to the 
optimum point. 
2. X Ltd. company profit increase is influenced by the number of optimal raw material stock ready that are able to 
meet the needs of finished goods production to meet customer demands. The minimization of waste warehouse, 
the level of raw material return, and the amount of WIP can reduce the cost of the warehouse and production 
section. Increased custom production, domestic sales, and export companies can increase the number of finished 
goods production companies and increase the number of company profits as a result of the many products sold 
to the market both locally (domestic) and overseas (export). 
3. Alternative strategies to overcome crisis problems will determine the optimal raw material inventory to the level 
of finished goods production in meeting customer demand at X Ltd. is by intervening in raw material return 
variables, raw material checks, raw material purchases, warehouse stock, waste warehouse, production targets, 
WIP percentage, safety stock percentage, and domestic sales percentage. 
4. The decision scenario chosen by the company is scenario 1 with the company's profit level starting to increase 
steadily from 2018 until 2020. The increase that occurs at the profit level is Rp 794,879,346.00 (2018 to 2019) 
and amounting to Rp 1,841,444,136.00 (2019 to 2020). The level of finished goods has increased significantly 
with an average growth of 43 pcs-977 pcs. The customer demand level has increased steadily with an average 
growth of 256 pcs-408 pcs. The level of raw stock ready material has increased with an average growth of 644 
pcs-2125 pcs. The reason the company chose scenario 1 as the selected scenario was the trend in data for 
company profits and other levels that had a trend that increased stably and significantly than the other two 
scenarios.

Abstract 
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders have posed a concern on both the individual’s health and industries. In India 
majority of workforce are in the informal economy, also known as unorganised sector in the country. Among the 
unorganised sector, stone quarry, cutting and polishing units are where a large number of workers are involved and 
prone to various occupational injuries and health hazards. The present study focuses on occupational health and 
safety deficiencies in the stone quarry, cutting and polishing industry in North Karnataka. The study was conducted 
using Nordic Questionnaire, Postural analysis using REBA method and on use of PPEs and other welfare activities. 
The collected data was analysed statistically. The results indicated prevalence of WRMSDs in both stone quarry 
workers and stone cutting and polishing workers. The REBA scores showed a significant high risk among majority 
of workers. Physical work environment factors like noise and heat were also measured, and found to be above the 
acceptable levels. It is concluded that the working conditions in stone quarries, cutting and polishing units’ needs to 
be improved. The postures adopted by workers are mostly in higher risk categories and need to be changed urgently. 
The noise levels are above the permissible limits and the use of PPEs should be encouraged. Overall the productivity 
of these industries can be improved by incorporating the ergonomics and OHS recommendations.

Abstract 
Rail failure is one of the serious problems in the railway industry. Rail failures can significantly impact rail 
safety as well as foster numerous maintenance challenges. A better understanding of the parameters that 
lead to rail failures and the ability to predict their uncertainties would result in the facilitation of a more 
focused maintenance procedure. Rail under-head failure (RUF) occurrence is common in heavy haul rail 
operations and hence chosen for the modelling and discussions presented in this paper. Stochastic risk 
analysis of RUF was conducted to determine the probability of its occurrence. The parameters included in 
the analysis are: vertical elastic foundation of the rail, daily and/or seasonal temperature variances, 
headwear, a contact patch offset (CPO) and the lateral to vertical force ratio (L/V) acting on the rail head. 
The methodology involves both qualitative and quantitative risk analyses of the above failure parameters. 
The qualitative analysis was performed by using fault tree analysis and Boolean algebra to determine 
minimum cut sets. Further, the failure parameter probabilities for the developed quantitative model are 
assigned after consulting expert opinion and previous research. A simple quantitative model using 
triangular distributions was created to serve as a template to perform more complex quantitative modelling 
with higher level probabilistic distributions. The results were analysed and compared with existing research. 
The results indicated 14-23.5% probability for RUF occurrence in 90% of the cases. Both the simple and 
complex models had very similar results and displayed skewness’s that match previous infrastructural 
studies on risk analysis. The results conclude that appropriate actions should be taken in maintenance 
planning to prevent the parameters that can lead to RUF.

1. Introduction
Rail wear and cracks are major maintenance challenges in the railway systems. In general, inevitable issues such as 
severe head wear combined with transverse defects are among the leading factors for rail failures and safety concerns. 
The root causes and consequences of rail failures are mostly analysed as deterministic, although many can be deemed 
as probabilistic. A better understanding of the parameters that lead to railway failures and the ability to predict their 
uncertainties would result in the facilitation of a more focused maintenance procedure. Only few such as Liu et al. 
(2008), Zhu et al. (2013) and Mohammadzadeh et al. (2013) discussed specific probabilistic perspectives of railway 
failures. Liu et al. [1] assessed the multiaxial fatigue reliability analysis of railroad wheels. Mohammadzadeh et al. 
(2013) conducted reliability analysis of fatigue crack initiation of rail head in bolted rail joints. Zhu et al. (2013) 
performed the probabilistic modelling of damage accumulation for time dependent fatigue reliability analysis of 
railway axle steels.

4. Discussions 
Stochastic risk analysis of RUF was achieved as outlined in the results. The first part of this stochastic analysis was 
to qualitatively analyse the parameters that lead to RUF. The six major factors considered have all been thoroughly 
evaluated in previous research; therefore it is known that they play a major part in causing RUF. The fault tree that 
was developed incorporated all these factors and was adjusted to cater for the use of software for risk analysis. 
Determination of the minimum cut sets proved successful, all basic events in the fault tree are independent of each 
other and are connected with “OR” gates. Because of this, using Boolean algebra to produce a simplified fault tree 
was a straight forward process. 
The Palisade Decision Tools - @Risk software (version 7.5) was used for the stochastic analysis in this research. The 
first step in the process was to assign probabilities to each basic event in the fault tree. The most important aspect of 
assigning the probabilities was to justify them using expert opinion and peer reviewed research. This was completed 
well due to the use of major sensitivity studies into the crack growth life of rail, subject to each failure parameter as 
was demonstrated by Jeong et al. (1998) and Lyons et al. (2009). Simple triangular distributions provided the first set 
of results, they followed a normal distribution and it seemed that increasing the complexity of the distributions may 
increase the accuracy of the results. A new set of complex input distributions were used and they produced very similar 
results. 
Both sets of results showed similarities. The simple analysis produced a probability density function of a normal shape 
with RUF having between a 13.7 and 23.4% chance of occurrence in 90% of cases. The complex model was slightly 
more negatively skewed, like a lognormal distribution, and RUF had between a 14.2 % and 23.7% chance of 
occurrence, 90% of the time. The only difference between the two sets of results was the complex model having a 
narrower range and slightly positively skewed probability density function. Because of this, it can be said that this 
range of RUF probabilities is fairly accurate, despite the need for some obvious improvements. 
To refine and improve the results, additional steps with further analysis were taken in this research – e.g. a qualitative 
analysis for the complexities of the fault tree. Further research is required to expand the datasets and additional 
parameters to explore the underlying relationships between parameters and refine the Boolean algebra including 
AND/OR gates and probability values. A notable fix would be to further explore the relationship between CPO and 
L/V ratio, as they are closely linked. An AND gate, as well as considering factors like train hunting and curving 
movements, might produce a better model of the system. Improvements of the quantitative analysis would start with 
improving the accuracy of the assigned probabilities, through experimentation, real data capture and expert input. Of 
course, comprehensive capturing of real world data in the heavy haul rail industry will provide relevant opportunities 
for exploring further and developing sound theoretical concepts and practical predictive models of rail asset 
management. 
 
5. Conclusions  
Rail failures such as rail under-head failure (RUF) are inevitable and hence a major concern for the railway industry. 
RUF occurrence is significant in heavy haul rail operations. Stochastic risk analysis of RUF was conducted and the 
parameters considered are: vertical elastic foundation of the rail, daily and/or seasonal temperature variances, 
headwear, contact patch offset (CPO), and the lateral to vertical force ratio (L/V) acting on the rail head. The results 
revealed that if one or combination of basic events in the fault tree happens then the RUF has a probability of 
occurrence is between 14-23.5%, which is significant. The input probabilities have come about from expert opinion 
and previous research, so it can be concluded that this is a fairly accurate model. Moreover, the results resemble a 
lognormal distribution, which confirms to the previously verified models in the literature. The parameters that lead to 
RUF should be thoroughly considered, and suitable maintenance planning strategies should be implemented in order 
to develop preventative mitigation of these failures.

Abstract 
Abstract— E-book has become a widely used tool by schools and universities to complement printed books.  Previous studies 
conclude that the ability of e-books to convey knowledge is not as effective as with the printed books. The performance of 
e-books in terms of student’s reading comprehension and retention is not satisfactory as compared to printed books   The
paper intends to a assess the current design of e-books and develop an appropriate design to enhance its acceptability over
printed book which will further improve student’s reading comprehension and retention. The design focuses on user
preferences and features in accordance with the Guidelines of Designing an Electronic Book and Golden Rules of User
Interface from Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Concepts.
Keywords 
E-book, HCI, Comprehension, Retention
1. Introduction
With an emerging trend in technology, printed books are now being replaced by e-Books. Some publishing companies 
like Newsweek and Britannica Encyclopedia has stopped printing and opted to adapt digital publishing. The fame of 
e-Books has expanded that even the educational sector was influenced with this technology.
According to Yoon Tecnam, most experts agree that E-books will be the wave of the future education considering the
fact that younger generations are becoming more proficient in using computers at very early age. Also, the rate of
internet users increased at an astounding rate of over two million each month which means that interests in E-book
readings had been elevated.  (Tecnam, 2012).  However, in the study conducted by Jeong, students who read printed
books are better in reading comprehension, performed better on quizzes, and suffered less eye fatigue (Jeong 2012).
In Princeton University’s Amazon Kindle Pilot Study, it was concluded that retention of information was decreased
when using a Kindle e-reader due to its lack of flipping and skimming functionality, the screen size of e-readers, poor
zoom capabilities, difficulty to read graphics, and the use of continuous scrolling to navigate texts (particularly in PDF
format). The current E-book cannot easily make use of text features and cognitive mapping to retain information. Text
features (such as chapter and section headings, captions, illustrations, charts, tables, and graphs) help readers
comprehend and remember what they’ve read. (Fisher and Frey, 2008; Morrison and Nunnery, 2011; Yang, Chen and
Li, 2011). “Cognitive mapping” is a technique in which readers use text features and physical cues such as the location
of information on the page and the position in the book to go back and find a section of text or even to help retain and
recall the information they had read. Cognitive mapping is more difficult with e-texts. (Hickey, 2011).
2. Methodology
To come up with an ergonomically design e-book,  the authors conducted a  survey to university students  to determine 
users preferences, assess the technical specifications to be prioritized in the design using Quality Function Deployment 
(QFD) and develop an E-book prototype based on users requirements and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) 
concepts.

4. Evaluation of the proposed e-book design 
In order to assess if the proposed e-book is effective, the researchers conducted hands-on activity using the printed 
materials, current e-Book and the proposed e-Book. Comprehension test was done by using set of questions being 
rated by the respondents using Likert Scale (refer to Table 4). After a week, the comprehension test was made retention 
test was conducted. The results show that the proposed e-book is more effective. Then, test for significant differences 
was made in order to determine which e-book format is more comprehensive and retentive according to the 
performance of the respondents through series of tests.

Since P-Value is less than the alpha of 0.10 therefore significant differences are realized. Hence, the improved e-book 
presentation is more comprehensive and retentive compared to the current format 
Conclusion 
The significant differences in the analysis of t-test prove that the proposed e-book presentation is most likely helpful 
and innovated towards the impending future of education. It will likely improve student comprehension and retention.

Tourism demand plays a significant role in development of tourism sector. As Malaysia is a multiracial 
country with a rich heritage, it consists of 13 states and three federal territories. Malaysia is presenting an 
average 26.13 millions of tourist arrivals with the average RM69.84 billions of tourist receipts. The 
performance of Malaysia tourism sector is in prospect with the improvement of every field which is 
related to tourism sector. Therefore, to boost the improvement and development, the researcher proposes 
to identify the best forecasting technique for forecast the tourism demand and choose Sabah as the 
research place in this study because of its motley of cultures. On top of that, Sabah tourism is one of the 
major contributors to Sabah’s economy. There are two forecasting techniques will be applied which are 
ANN approach. The results will be compared for purpose to identify the best forecasting technique for 
forecast the tourism demand of Sabah, Malaysia. Besides, the interview conducted in order to 
comprehend the reasons that influence tourist arrivals in Sabah. Based on the results of the study, the 
researcher concluded that the Artificial Neural Network is the best forecasting technique for forecast the 
number of tourist arrivals in Sabah for the future. This information provided an outline for develop 
tourism policy to increase tourism demand and Sabah’s economic status. From this study, it will 
effectively give a boost to growth the nation’s economy indirectly

1. Introduction
Tourism is one of the major business sectors and it is representing 7% of the total world exports. Meanwhile,
tourism is also a growing market (Höpken et al., 2017). The tourism industry prospers on information
(Benckendorff et al., 2014). Aruna (2013) says that “tourism has proven to be a catalyst for development and
these dynamics have turned the industry into a key driver for economic growth”. There is a lot of effort that
worked by the Ministry of Tourism and Culture Malaysia as well as the local citizens in order to boost the
tourism sector and nation culture to the worldwide. The government is trying to put greater effort in order to
boost the tourism field by increasing the yield per tourist to attract the higher yield segment (Aruna, 2013). The

Abstract 
IC Design has been an industry which provides flexible application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) services 
enabling semiconductor manufacturing companies for flexible decision. Although the industry influences 
semiconductor supply chain significantly, capacity portfolio and planning issues of IC design industry is seldom 
mentioned in the past studies. For IC design service industry, the main productivity denotes to IC design which is 
influenced by the performance of project management from workforce allocation. The purpose of this study is to 
develop an intelligent agent to predict the workforce required for each wafer production service project, and thus based 
on the prediction, the intelligent agent is able to provide an IC design service company with workforce allocation 
strategy. Featuring learning algorithms and analyzing from the existing data, the study trains a XG Boosting model 
combining Genetic Algorithm based parameter optimization mechanism. The proposed intelligent agent contributes 
to Total Resource Management (TRM) to enhance productivity, reduce costs and intelligence management.

1. Introduction
Remaining as the most capital intensive industry, semiconductor industry has been promoted as the main development 
industry in the last decades and is increasingly important for the industry value chain in Taiwan. Besides, driven by 
Moore’s Law, the critical dimension in semiconductor shrinks rapidly via the advanced technology nowadays. The 
practical phenomenon and the ambitious of reinforcing competitive advantage has motivated enterprises to improve 
capital effectiveness in needs of higher return of investments (ROI) (Wu & Chien, 2008). In order to fulfill shrinking 
customer demand and market structure, semiconductor industry owes rapid growth in recent years. Moore’s Law has 
confronted the verge of physical limits, since market mechanism, customers’ demand for chip specification is 
increasing explicit which leads to the high variation of the market, shrinking life cycle of electronic products. Besides, 
as an inspect of recent semiconductor manufacturing system, R&D capital is greatly improved, the advanced 
technologies continuously migrate increasingly complication (Chien, Chen, Hsu, & Wang, 2014; Chien et al., 2011; 
Leachman, Ding, & Chien, 2007) based on the shorter product life cycle. Similar pieces of equipment are employed 
for the required product receipt to produce integrated circuits featuring complicated processes with production 
constraints, reentrant or rework process flows, sophisticated high product mix and manufacturing environment 
(Khakifirooz, Chien, & Chen, 2018). The pursuit of miniaturization and functional perfection of integrated circuit (IC) 
leads to lower yield, higher production lead time, and inaccurate prediction of future situation. It is an obvious future 
trend that technology development and wafer fabrication are bound to move to the next stage of quantum level, which 
means that the it will be more capital intensive of costs for research and technology development. Accurately 
predicting the needs of the project and effectively scheduling the company's resources can increase production 
capacity and save costs. The cost saved for the company can be fed back to technology research and development to 
enhance the company's competitiveness. 
Semiconductor supply chain is composed of the following three incorporated sectors: (1) IC design, (2) IC 
manufacturing, and (3) IC packaging and testing. The study conducts the empirical study for Taiwan IC design and

5. Conclusion 
 
IC Design has been an industry which provides flexible application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) services 
enabling semiconductor manufacturing companies for flexible decision. The decision-making process for 
standardizing manpower planning will greatly help the industry. It will ensure that the company can produce projects 
and research and development technology with the most appropriate manpower, thereby maintaining the company's 
high degree of competitiveness in terms of financial or technical aspects. For IC design service industry, the main 
productivity denotes to IC design which is influenced by the performance of project management from workforce 
allocation. This study proposes an intelligent agent system for standardizing IC-D&S project process, which combines 
machine learning algorithms and analyzing from the existing data. The study trains a XG Boosting model with Genetic 
Algorithm (GA) based parameter optimization mechanism combining the existing rules of thumb of domain experts 
to optimize by time and reduce the bias of human estimation. The proposed intelligent agent contributes to Total 
Resource Management (TRM) to enhance productivity, reduce costs and intelligence management.

Abstract 
We introduce the “Pollution Traveling Salesman Problem” (PTSP), a generalization of  the well-known Traveling 
Salesman Problem which aims at finding a Hamiltonian tour that minimizes a function of fuel consumption 
(dependent on distance traveled, vehicle speed and vehicle load) and driver costs. We present a Mixed Integer 
Linear Programming (MILP) model for the PTSP, enhanced with subtour elimination constraints, and propose an 
Iterated Local Search (ILS) metaheuristic algorithm. The ILS algorithm first builds a feasible tour, based on the 
solution of  the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation of  the MILP model, and then loops between three phases: 
perturbation, local search and acceptance criterion. The results obtained  by the ILS algorithm on instances with up 
to 50 customers are compared with those found by a Cut-and-Branch algorithm based on the enhanced MILP model. 
The results show the effectiveness of the ILS algorithm, which can find the best solution for about 99% of the 
instances within short computing times.

Abstract 
Social media is subverting the way we communicate with each other and breaking the limits imposed by 
physical barriers. Users can message each other through a simple interface. The applications of social media 
have rewritten human communication and how we stay connected to each other’s lives. The convenience 
of social media has also affected our daily lives and it has been used extensively by companies and 
organizations. However, even though social media is convenient and beneficial for social interaction in 
various ways, it may also have a downside as well as harmful consequences for users. In past studies, 
researchers have always focused on the positive influences of social media. However, even though social 
media is convenient and beneficial for social interaction in various ways, it may also have a downside as 
well as harmful consequences for users. Although social media can be a source of relaxation or 
entertainment for users, social media operators cannot predict the negative effects like privacy frustrations 
and perceived lack of control, enduring social comparison and jealousy, or excessive use of social media 
that arise from the combination of the negative and social factors. In addition, some studies have also 
confirmed that the excessive use of social media results in a reduction in well-beingand friendships or 
relationships ending prematurely. Thus, in order to understand the consequences of the negative factors 
towards social media, these negative factors are included in this study. In the process of using social media, 
social media providers should exercise proper control over user privacy, like securing messaging, strict 
management of personal information and reducing the negative factors towards using social media like 
advertisement and unfiltered obscene content. This will increase the users’ willingness to continue to use 
social media. Furthermore, while using social media, users will develop social fatigue because of the 
negative factors towards social media, which affects their willingness to continue using social media. Based 
on the above information and objectives, the purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the negative 
factors towards social media on users’ willingness to continue using social media. Through the analysis and 
discussion in this study, we wish to offer related social media providers suggestions on how improvements 
could be made.

Abstract 
The objective is to identify occupational disease among solid waste management workers in context of health disease. 
Health disease that occur among solid waste management workers such as respiratory disease, skin disease, hepatitis 
and needle puncture, cardiovascular problems, coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal disease and experience 
symptoms of poisoning. Method of collecting data is using questionnaire that were distribute among solid waste 
management in State A (kept confidential due to privacy). Total of respondent only 233 individuals from two main 
district in State A. The data is analysis by using SPSS to get the frequency and percentage for each question under the 
element of Health Disease. Data showing that majority of respondents reported that they sometimes having cough, 
wheezing, itching, rashes, and eyes irritates, diarrhea and nausea.

Introduction 
Health disease that occur among solid waste management workers such as respiratory disease, skin disease, hepatitis 
and needle puncture, cardiovascular problems, coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal disease and experience 
symptoms of poisoning. The solid waste industry work is physically tough and faces various risk of accident which 
increases the frequency of accidents (Mase et al, 2008). 
Since in landfills there were all kinds of harmful gas causing the workers involved directly and indirectly in 
landfills and facilities centre also exposed to unknown hazards. Most common gas that existing namely bio-aerosol, 
greenhouse gases and volatile compounds. This statement supported by Rushton (2003) that state “increased exposure 
to bio-aerosols and volatile compounds may lead to elevated incidence of work-related respiratory, gastrointestinal 
and skin problems in waste collections compared to the general workforce”. Indirect health effects due to the 
contribution of greenhouse gases from waste disposal activities could be significant.

Abstract  
 
Abstract— Specialized Software has been developed and designed for planning, control and maintenance of transportation systems 
to prevent breakdown and ensure customer safety and satisfaction. Trains are at risk of facing mechanical problems that can lead 
to accidents and service interruptions if maintenance has not been properly observed. Thus, the researchers conducted the study 
which aims to develop a computer based maintenance system (CBMS)  that will provide (1) more accurate preventive maintenance 
(PM) schedule (2) easy monitoring of available technicians to handle the maintenance and (3) spare parts monitoring to ensure that 
the items are available when needed. This research presents the design of an application software covering scheduled preventive 
maintenance for rolling stocks, preparation of ticket request for corrective maintenance, notification of assigned technicians, 
recording of spare parts to be used and generation of reports relevant to user’s/ manager’s decision making functions. The authors 
were able to assess the current maintenance and scheduling processes to determine system requirements and come up with the 
design that will improve the maintenance system.

1. Introduction 
 
The Metro Rail Transit (MRT-3), is one of two light rail transits in the Philippines. It was designed to carry about 
23,000 to 48,000 passengers per hour per direction. However, from the year 2010 to 2015, the passengers reached 
174.5M with an average daily ridership of 369,838 which deemed MRT-3 as the highest in the number of passengers 
(PSA, 2015). The growing number affects the train’s performance and service interruptions caused by machine 
breakdown were experienced by commuters. These service interruptions (SI) are classified into sections, namely: the 
rolling stock, track, signal, power and overhead system catenary. The situation has worsened from January 2016 to 
February 2017 as there were 63 breakdowns recorded and 32 breakdowns were caused by rolling stock (electric train 
units). Moreover, at the given period, though there are scheduled or planned maintenance for specific trains, there were 
unexpected breakdowns that occurred ahead of the given schedule due to inaccurate scheduling. The present 
maintenance system lacks the ability to easily monitor the status of each train, to check the availability of spare parts 
as replacement and to notify the technicians of the next maintenance schedule. This paper will provide the MRT 
management and users with accurate maintenance schedule and automated processing of service maintenance from 
request for service to service completion specifically on rolling stock.

Conclusion 
The researchers were able to develop a prototype of an automated maintenance system that will facilitate the processing 
of maintenance transactions and will provide a more accurate maintenance schedule to prevent service interruptions.  
Furthermore, system output provide operational support specifically on manpower and spare parts utilization. Reports 
and charts / visual analytics that can be generated will help in the analysis of the transaction trends specifically on 
breakdowns and service interruptions, thus, preemptive measures will be considered.

Abstract 
Pilot study is a step to evaluate the effectiveness of survey instrument as a medium of communication between 
researchers and respondents. This paper aims to get the instrument ready for use on actual data retrieval. Pilot study 
is divided into two stages, qualitative pilot study and quantitative pilot study. In qualitative pilot study, the researcher 
used nine respondents, while for the quantitative study used 36 respondents. Based on the results, the studies obtained 
the questionnaires are ready to be used in the process of pilot study quantitative. In the pilot quantitative study obtained 
the result that of the ninety-nine items of question there are four items that are invalid so that should be discarded. For 
variable reliability, all variables have a Cronbach alpha value greater than 0.6 so it can be said that all variables are 
reliable and used in further surveys.

1. Introduction
Organizational creativity is the most discussed topic by academicians. This has been proved by the number of articles 
with the keyword of organizational creativity published in google scholar (1,220,000). A research on organizational 
creativity can be associated with several fields, most of which is psychology (Barron and Harrington, 1981; Gurteen 
and Associates, 1998; King and Anderson, 1990, Payne, 1990, Carrol, 1985), with creative products or product 
innovation (Amabile, 1983; Woodman et al., 1993; Cokpekin and Knudsen, 2011; Moldoveanu and Langer, 2011), 
with knowledge management (Migdadi, 2005; Chen, 2012). 
A study on such fields as innovation and business was initiated by Amabile (1988), who developed creativity model 
and organizational innovation. In addition, Woodman et al. (1993) developed multilevel models of organizational 
creativity including individual, group, and organization. Both researchers are pioneers of research on organizational 
creativity. Their research resulted in a conceptual model of research on organizational creativity.  
The article aims at conducting a pilot study of the resulted research models (Indriartiningtias et al, 2017). The purpose 
of the pilot study is to evaluate the effectiveness of survey instrument as communication medium between researchers 
and respondents.

1994). Face validity and content validity were carried out in qualitative manners on stag of qualitative pilot study. 
This part discusses validity of research variables measured in quantitative manners using convergent validity, 
particularly Pearson Correlation. The measurement of validity results in the elimination of 1 item of independent 
variables X1 and 2 items of variables X3. Therefore, the remaining number of items to measure instruments X1 and X3 
is 19 and 33, respectively. 
 
Reliability of instrument is related to consistency of instrument measurement indicated by value of coefficient of 
Cronbach alpha (α) on each variable. A method proposed by Cronbach (1951) is useful to measure item consistency 
on similar variables (inter-item reliability). The values of coefficient of alpha of all variables are regarded high (above 
0.7) (Ghozali, 2006). The overview of the valid number of items, including the reliability and category can be seen 
from Table 5.

It is clear from Table 5 that all variables have been consistently used to measure research variables. Several invalid 
items were eliminated and were not used in the subsequent process. 
 
5. Conclusions and Suggestions 
 
The article discusses the results of pilot study on creativity of creative industries in Indonesia. Qualitative pilot study 
results in an instrument free from typographical errors, punctuation errors, avoids uncommon or sensitive words and 
long questionnaire causing respondents to find difficulties to fill. The results of the pilot study were used in stage of 
quantitative pilot study. 
   
Quantitative pilot study is a process to examine the reliability and consistency levels of an instrument used. The stage 
results in an instrument which is ready to be used for the main study. 
 
This study has several drawbacks. First, on the first stage of qualitative study, only respondents of doctoral students 
were involved. Therefore, further studies should involve respondents of non-industry parties coming from several 
levels. Second, data obtained from the results of the pilot study can actually be used to identify initial phenomenon of 
creativity process on creative industries in Indonesia. For that reason, the process should be done not only to test the 
instrument, but also to identify initial phenomenon occurring in creative industries in Indonesia. Further studies on 
initial phenomenon of organizational creativity on creative industries in Indonesia should be carried out.

4.2. Quantitative Pilot Study 
 
The data collection of the qualitative pilot study was done by distributing questionnaires previously tested in 
qualitative manners. Questionnaires were distributed directly and indirectly (using email). 
 
4.2.1. Respondents 
 
Creative industries were selected to be respondents of pilot study using convenience sampling from database. 
Respondents are expected to have good representation as creative industries in term of creativity process. Due to time 
limitation of the pilot study, 70 questionnaires were distributed. Of the 70 questionnaires, 36 questionnaires were 
completely filled by respondents of creative industries (response rate of 50%).  
 
All responses were made in a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Based on 
characteristics of research variables, the questionnaire is divided into three groups of respondents. Each group of 
respondents was asked to fill different questionnaires: (1) top management, (2) head of department/ design group/ R 
and D, and (3) design employees. 
The study used 7 variables comprising 3 independent variables (exogenous): individual creativity (X1) with total 
number of 20 items, group creativity (X2) with total number of 18 items, characteristics of organizational environment 
(X3) with total number of 35 items, and 2 dependent variables (endogenous): organizational creativity (Y1) with total 
number of 16 items and organization performance (Y2) with total number of 5 items. The description of variables

Abstract 
Operations Management/Industrial Engineering modeling process entails a series of research 
paradigm decisions to be made as to (1) what the reality domain is - ontology, (2) how the 
problem domain is to be defined and theorized - epistemology, and (3) which solution domain is 
to be considered – methodology; and all three being based on axiological assumptions entailing 
ethical concerns. These paradigm-related decisions need to be based on a series of sound 
reasoning activities. In this regard, three types of reasoning – abductive, deductive and inductive 
– will be discussed in connection with a scheme of Operational Research/Management Science
modeling process.
1. Introduction
It is interesting to observe that the reasoning types of abduction, induction, and deduction have not been 
made much of a concern in the Operations Management/Industrial Engineering. There are only very few studies that 
explicitly examines the roles of reasoning types in modeling process. In neighboring fields, however, such as System 
Dynamics, Cavana and Mares (2004) explicitly use deductive reasoning to justify a policy that was already put into 
practice.  Organization Science researchers, on the other hand, are more verbal and vociferous about the roles of 
reasoning types in research. For instance, Ketokivi and Mantere (2010) suggest two strategies for inductive 
reasoning in organizational research. Van de Ven (2007) discusses the roles of abduction, induction, and deduction 
at some length in connection with theory building. 
We assert that there is a need for a sound understanding of the roles of abduction, induction, and deduction 
in all stages of a modeling process. Well-informed uses of this triad of syllogism will enhance modeling process 
since the models thus constructed will be more valid and legitimate in the eyes of relevant stakeholders – model 
builders, model users, and model assessors.

abduction, deduction, and induction methods more explicitly in their future work. Particularly, the usefulness of 
abduction in generating new ideas in problem formulation and theory building will be recognized and new avenues 
will be opened for abductive reasoning in addition to those for deduction and induction.

Abstract 
Background : Information security in Hospital Information System (HIS) become main issue in protected the patient 
privacy data due to it can be online accessed and susceptible attacked by malware- Misc-Activity. Therefore, the main 
objective of this study to investigate the capability level of information security in HIS. Method and Result: 
Quantitative method was performed in this study by questionnaire analysis in 86 respondents who apply HIS on the 
system. This study was conducted in selected hospital in Bandung, Indonesia which is Soreang Hospital and the 
information security in HIS was evaluated by COBIT 5. Evaluation results show that the capability level in the Soreang 
hospital is at level 1 for DSS05 domains with L (Largely achieved) criteria and level 0 domains for APO13 domains 
with L (Largely achieved) criteria. The improvement of information security in HIS required to achieve the expected 
Capability level which is fully achieved criteria.

1.0 Introduction 
According to the Minister of Health issued the regulation No.89 in 2013 regarding Hospital Information System (HIS) 
aims to improve health services in Indonesia. That regulation stated that all hospitals are required to apply HIS and 
Emergency Respond Plan (ERP) system for improving healthcare (RI, 2011). HIS is one of the most common 
computer systems designed to support healthcare services (Bakshi & M, 2012). HIS are described as a complicated 
type, those systems have to support activities in hospital within application, tactical, and strategic levels (Pasandideh 
& Shafiri, 2016). 
Nowadays, online system of HIS have many benefits for accessing patient record and transaction related to diagnosis 
patients. However, private data of patient become a serious issues due to it can be online accessed (Rai & Srivastava, 
2014). Therefore, HIS required to equipped by information security that work with three basic aspects which called 
by protecting patient's data confidentiality, ensuring data integrity and assuring data availability. Improving the 
information security in HIS become a critical issues in the operation of information systems where the data that is 
stored and processed is particularly sensitive (Hou, Gao, & Nicholson, 2018). Although many efforts have been made 
to prevent information security threats, especially in the healthcare area, there are still many unknown risks which 
may threat the security of health information.  
In HIS used many types of frameworks that focus on information security, but COBIT 5 framework is an appropriate 
frameworks for healthcare services due to it can be applied in any company and organization with any size (Luis Velez 
Lapao, 2012). Generally, COBIT has four domain and organization can consider using full COBIT framework, or 
organization can adopt specific control which the organization needs (Wolden, Valverde, & Talla, 2015). According 
to ISACA (2014), COBIT 5 has some process reference model and each process has different functions to ensure the 
users obtain the required data. Process reference model was divided in terms of field such as for outsourcing 
recommended using APO09 and APO10, for security using APO13 and DSS05, for software or hardware development

From Table 3 shows that for level 0-5 in APO13 has rating of 68.2-74.8% which include in the Largely achieved 
criteria, which means that the achievement process already has evidence of a systematic approach to and significant 
achievement of the attributes that have been determined in the process being assessed. The process that is considered 
may have several weaknesses associated with this attribute. Assessment details of poses managing services at level 0, 
is: The hospital is little or no evidence of any achievement of the process purpose. 
 
4.0 Conclusions 
 
The capability level of HIS for DSS5 and APO13 has been analyzed and the rating of the levels majority in L criteria. 
The information security for DSS5 domain for level 1-5 was in largely achieved status of 70-73.2%.While, level 0 
was in F criteria with rating value of 85.1%. In addition, for APO13 domain for level 0-5 was in largely achieved 
status of 68.2-74.8%. Therefore, the information security in Soreang hospital require to improved due to several 
weaknesses associated with this attribute. Some recommendation of to improve HIS has been formulated such as the 
first recommendation is for DSS05 namely Improve a standard procedure for hardware management operations to 
protect computers from malware threats such as viruses, worms, spam, and others. Making governance policy 
regulations and right internet usage. Management using passwords (scheduling for password change rottenly) and 
establish operating system procedures regarding the data back-up process regularly and periodically in order to avoid 
data loss, data theft, data tapping, data destruction by irresponsible people and IT threats or interruptions. The second 
recommendation is for APO13 namely Identify members involved in information security management activities in 
HIS, identify roles and responsibilities in detail in order to know the members responsible for monitoring, evaluating, 
and assessing the running system performance and Improve a standard procedure for security management for 
information, enabling secure technology and business processes that are aligned with business requirements and 
enterprise security management.

Abstract 
Road accident is a critical problem faced by most countries around the world. Literature showed that human factors 
contribute the most with 80% of the road accidents in Malaysia. Traffic violation behaviour is one of the human 
factors leading to the road accident causation. To overcome the drivers’ traffic violation behaviour and reduce the 
accident involvement statistics, the Malaysian government has implemented road safety management intervention of 
soft enforcement approaches (road safety campaign, education and training) and hard enforcement approaches 
(penalty, surveillance, fines and tickets). The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of road safety 
management intervention through the implementation of soft and hard enforcement approaches in overcoming the 
road accident involvement. Literatures demonstrated inconsistent findings on the effectiveness of the soft and hard 
enforcement approaches, which further suggest these variables as the moderators for this study. This study will be 
conducted on young drivers within the age of 18 to 25 years old who have been involved in road accident within the 
past 12 months. The research finding will provides the answer for accident involvement among young drivers and 
further confirms the effectiveness of road safety intervention in Malaysia.

1. Introduction
Road accident is a critical issue faced by most countries around the globe including Malaysia. The number of
road accident and road fatalities increases over the year and it has been reported that an average of 20 Malaysian 
died because of the road accident every day (Thiagarajan, 2017). This surprising statistics has placed Malaysia 
among the ASEAN countries with the highest road fatalities per overall population. This problem has been identified

these approaches failed to deliver positive outcome. As a result, inconsistent findings on the interventions made by 
the authorities to overcome drivers’ risky driving behaviour and accident involvement have proved the role of soft 
and hard enforcement approaches as the moderators to moderate the relationship between traffic violation behaviour 
and accident involvement. The findings of this study can provide the reasons behind the occurrence of accident 
involving young drivers in Malaysia and further confirm whether or not the current road safety interventions 
imposed by the government really work in overcoming this issue. Based on these findings, the best fit of road safety 
measure can be regulated by the authorities to cater this problem.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper was to examine the factor structure of the instruments measuring work engagement 
(Utrecht Work Engagement Scale / UWES) for Somaliland Telecommunication employees via factor 
analysis approach. Confirmatory factor analyses in the sample supported the superiority of the proposed 
three-factor structure of the UWES (vigor, dedication, and absorption). The results suggest that the 
UWES are valid instruments for testing work engagement.

1. Introduction
Organizational psychologists and managers are interested in employees’ engagement because it is a significant 
correlate of employee health and performance (Amos et al., 2017). Over the past decade, researchers have shifted 
the attention from employee malfunctioning to optimal functioning. This latter development reflects the trend 
towards a ‘positive psychology’ that focuses on human strengths rather than on weaknesses (Andrea et al., 2018). 
Bakker & Bal, (2010), underlined the need for positive organizational behavior research, defined as ‘the study and 
application of positively oriented human resource strengths and psychological capacities that can be measured, 
developed, and effectively managed for performance improvement in today’s workplace’. In this context, 
researchers and managers became interested in understanding not only what makes employees burned out, but also 
what makes them energetic and enthusiastic about their work (Bakker & Bal, 2010). This is because engaged 
employees enjoy better health, are more proactive and perform better. According to Bakker & Leiter (2010), 
contemporary organizations need employees who are psychologically connected to their work. The information and 
service economy of the 21st century requires employees who are willing and able to invest themselves fully in their 
roles. Organizations need employees who are energetic and dedicated, i.e., who are engaged in their work. It is 
therefore not surprising that, since the turn of the century, work engagement has gained significant popularity in the 
management (e.g., Macey, Schneider, Barbera, & Young, 2009) and scientific literature (e.g., Bakker & Leiter, 
2010).Thus, valid instruments to estimate employee work engagement are necessary both for researchers and 
managers. 
2. Work Engagement
According to Ruud et al., (2018) and Muntaha et al., (2013) work engagement is defined as a positive, fulfilling, 
work-related state of mind that is characterized by vigor, dedication, and absorption. Rather than a momentary and 
specific state, engagement refers to a more persistent and pervasive affective-cognitive state that is not focused on 
any particular object, event, individual, or behavior (Ruud et al., 2018). Vigor is characterized by high levels of 
3384","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Convergent: Convergent validity can be evaluated by the average variance extracted (AVE) values, which refers to 
the degree the construct identifies the variance of its indicators. The threshold value of (AVE) must be reported if it 
exceeds .50 (Ellen et al., 2015). In addition, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is another indicator of convergent 
validity by using PLS-SEM. The convergent validity is realized if the indicators or variables of each construct load 
exceeds .70 on their construct more than the other constructs (Ellen et al., 2015; Vinita, 2013). Table 3 shows the 
items loading and the (AVE) values for all the three factors of work engagement. As a result, the loading for all 
items in reflective construct is reported to have values above .70. In addition, AVE values exceeds the cutoff point 
.50. Consequently, the convergent validity is achieved among all factors of work engagement.   
Significance and relevance of the formative indicators: last stage of assessing the contribution of formative 
indicators and their relevance and outer weight is done by performing multiple regressions (Sungbum et al., 2017). 
In order to form study second-order formative-reflective construct, the latent variable scores for all first-order 
constructs are generated by PLS-SEM, and are linked as formative indicators to the second-order construct. 
However, to picture this, the latent second-order construct is treated as a dependent construct and the formative 
indicators (latent scores) as independent constructs. This procedure is recommended by Hair et al., (2014) when 
first-order constructs have different numbers of items. Furthermore, by comparing the value of outer weights 
indicators, one can decide the relative contribution of a particular indicator by taking into account its level of 
significance. Table 4 depicts that work engagement' indicators such as vigor, absorption and dedication, as reported 
all their outer weights are positive and significant.

6. Conclusion 
 
The present study showed that the instruments that are broadly used to measure work engagement (UWES; 
Schaufeli & Bakker, 2010) are meaningful, when these instruments are used. The confirmatory and factor analysis 
results from Smart PLS and SPSS respectively, suggest that UWES are valid instruments for testing work 
engagement. In addition, the findings of confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence supporting the reliability 
and three-factor structure of the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale for employees when evaluated with a Somaliland 
Telecommunication employees’ sample in this study. Thus, it is appropriate to use The Utrecht Work Engagement 
Scale for the assessment of the work engagement of the employees.

Abstract 
The study considered a company which is among the most in demand 3PL service provider that caters one of the 
largest manufacturing facilities in the Philippines. The research involved evaluation of the warehouse and 
distribution operations in the facility to measure its productivity and efficiency level. Significant findings on 
operating times such as total time stayed inside the distribution center (DC), case picking time, total unloading time 
and gap time were observed which contributed to warehouse inefficiency. Through facility design and systems 
improvement, the warehouse and distribution operations were re-designed, and a model was developed and tested 
through simulation. The model presented a significant improvement in the DCs operation which will consequently 
increase its productivity and efficiency level.

1. Introduction
Supply chain’s dynamic characteristics involves the constant flow of information, product, and funds between 
suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and customers (Chopra, 2013). The presence of distributors or 
logistics service provider, one of the key players in a supply chain, contribute to achieving supply chain efficiency 
since they are responsible not only in the sourcing of raw materials and supplies but also in the distribution of 
finished goods to customer (Ceniga and Sukalova, 2015). In the present time, companies, especially the 
multinational ones with wide geographic market, are now more aggressive to outsource logistics services with the 
aim of reducing cost and improving operational efficiency. Outsourcing logistics functions enables a company to 
focus on its core competencies and utilize their resources to the fullest (Hong et al., 2004, Lieb and Bentz, 2005, 
Kain and Verma, 2018). In such practice, a company may take advantage of selecting the best in the field of third-
party logistics or 3PL, utilize the best technology available, and reduce operational costs.  
In the Philippines’ supply chain industry, data of the last two years presented in Table 1 showed that transport, 
storage and communication component posted the lowest growth rate of 5.8% among the industries (PSA, 2018).

4. Conclusion 
 
3PL services are highly utilized for the distribution of retail and consumer goods. These services offer 
responsiveness to consumer demand and help reduce distribution costs in the supply chain. Warehouse and 
distribution management involves a complex task to ensure on-time delivery of quality goods to customers when 
needed. The study made a review of the current warehouse and distribution operation of a 3PL service provider in 
the Philippines. It was found that bottlenecks in the receiving and dispatching goods were present which made the 
productivity and operational efficiency lower than targeted. The use of simulation enabled the researchers to better 
analyze the processes, identify bottlenecks in the operation, and measure the efficiency level. The important 
elements that affect productivity and efficiency include the method of loading and unloading process, availability or 
type of material handling equipment used, and manpower accessibility. Considering these drivers, a model simulator 
was used to develop a new warehouse design utilizing a conveyor system. The new system will not only increase 
efficiency but will also improve utilization rate of resources, increase productivity, and increase capacity.

Abstract 
Recently, many efforts has been made to improve the potency of natural polymer-based flocculants in wastewater 
treatment. Graft copolymerization of magnetic cellulose and polyacrylamide (PAM-g-MagCell) were synthesized 
through microwave assisted technique with the aid of ceric-ion-induced as catalyst. Through varying the monomer, 
polysaccharide and mass of catalyst, five grades of PAM-g-MagCell were synthesized. The influences of these factors 
toward grafting percentage were investigate. The flocculation performance of PAM-g-MagCell was also studied in 
treating anaerobically-treated palm oil mill effluent (AnPOME). The grafting ratio suggested that the optimum 
conditions for graft copolymerization were composed of 0.25 g catalyst ceric ammonium nitrate and 4:1 mass ratio of 
acrylamide monomer to magnetic cellulose. The results found that under such optimum conditions, flocculation 
performance had improved, whereby, sampled wastewater coloration and suspended solid were significantly reduced 
by 50% and 65%, respectively.

1.0 Introduction 
Palm oil thrives rapidly in regions with extensive tropical forest lands, spanning Asia, South Africa, and South 
America continents. Despite the recognition gained by the oil palm industry in driving the world economy, the 
industry’s large-scale oil extraction activities have led to the generation of by-products in massive volumes, which 
have raised environmental concerns. Palm oil mill effluent (POME) is one of the largest non-fibrous by-products, 
released in the form of liquid discharge from oil palm processing plants, which contributed to water pollution. 
According to Madaki and Seng (2013), about 3.5 m3 or 2.5 tons of POME is yielded for every ton of processed crude 
palm oil (CPO). 
In current practice, palm oil mill treat raw POME through utilizing traditional biological process, such as ponding 
system. Nonetheless, ponding system is considered as challenging as it requires a long retention time and large area 
(Abdurahman et al. 2013). Attributed to the challenges, scholars have explored various cost-effective and practical 
alternatives to treat POME. There is a compelling scholastic evidence that signifies the increase of interest in replacing 
inorganic material (i.e. alum or ferric chloride) in treating POME with environmentally friendly coagulants. Most 
recently, coagulation-flocculation has been used as an alternative to treat POME, owing to its nascent capability in 
destabilizing and aggregating colloids (Alhaji et al. 2016). 
Among all natural sources, cellulose is one of the most abundant natural polysaccharide resources that has been 
subjected in many research efforts. Its application as coagulants or flocculants has been applied widely in many 
industries, such as in removing turbidity from drinking water (Sillanpää et al. 2018), municipal wastewater treatment 
(Suopajärvi et al. 2013) and various others. However, the natural polymer is vulnerable to biodegradation as the

sites at a fixed quantity of polymers.  In addition, reduction of grafting percentage beyond the optimum amount of 
CAN may be attributed to the formation of more Fe3+ ions at a higher molar ratio, which resulted in the termination 
of polyacrylamide chain’s growth (Thakur et al. 2013). 
 
The presence of CAN not only affected the grafting percentage but also affected the percentage of pollutant 
removal. Figure 4 indicates that increasing the dosage of catalyst had increased the percentage of removal of TSS and 
reduction of color, prior to decreasing after reaching a certain limit. Percentage of removal was at peak when the CAN 
dosage was set at 0.25g. Under such dosage, more free radicals were released from the polymerization of AM. As a 
result, more PAM chains were produced to entrap the TSS and color molecules, which consequently increased the 
percentage of removal. Beyond this optimum point, the performance fell significantly due to the hydrolysis of CAN. 
The hydrolysis had lessened the formation of active sites, which were required for the polymerization of PAM to 
occur. As a consequence, less chains were available for the removal of colloidal solids and color pigments. 
 
4.0 Conclusion 
 
PAM-g-MagCell 1 yielded the highest grafting percentage and good flocculation performance in removing TSS and 
color presence in AnPOME. The study on catalyst concentration also observed that minimal amount of CAN (0.25g) 
had managed to produce the highest grafting and removal percentages. Among the grafted grades, copolymers having 
fewer but longer PAM chains showed better flocculation performance than those with shorter PAM chains, owing to 
easy approachability of the dangling grafted chains to attach to contaminants. Microwave assisted are proven to be 
the best option to enhance the grafting process between monomer and natural polymer as backbone. In overall, the 
results support the objectives in this study.

Abstract 
Road accident is a predominant agenda that keep increases over the years. It has been also reported as among the 
death contributors worldwide, which requires an urgent respond from all countries around the world. Therefore, to 
overcome this issue, a comprehensive understanding on the reasons behind the occurrence of road accident is 
required. This review paper aimed to investigate the determinants of road accident specifically on the environmental 
factors. A systematic review process was conducted through five academic databases of Emerald, ScienceDirect, 
Scopus, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library. A total of 2462 findings were identified through database 
searching process. After several screening and reviewing processes, a total of 45 studies were included in this 
review. The results of the review indicated that bad/adverse weather and night time driving were the most common 
environmental factors contributing to road accident. Based on the findings, appropriate countermeasures can be 
outlined to curb these issues.

1. Introduction
Road accident is among the worst health hazard killing more than 1.25 million people every year (World 
Health Organization, 2018). Road accident statistics increases every year despite various preventive measures 
outlined by the government (national level) or World Health Organization (WHO) (international level). It has also 
been reported that approximately, 90% of the road fatalities occurred in low and middle income countries. India has 
been reported to lead the world road fatalities statistics with an estimation of 17 people dying every hour. This 
alarming rate caused a significant loss to the family, society and the government. Those considered as “vulnerable”

Abstract 
Surfactant flooding has been proven to be effective in recovering large quantity of residual oil which is not possible 
to be recovered by primary and secondary schemes. Surfactants contribute towards enhanced sweep efficiency that 
brought forward with higher capillary number and thereby facilitate interfacial tension (IFT) reduction, wettability 
alteration, emulsion formation and better sweep efficiency to improve oil recovery. Surfactant adsorption 
characteristics have been extensively studied for various combinations of surfactants (ionic and non-ionic surfactants 
and natural surfactants) and reservoir core samples (reservoir rocks, sandstone and Berea cores). In order to determine 
the adsorption capacity of surfactant on Assam reservoir rock at constant temperature, four different adsorption 
isothermal models were applied. The interaction of polymer and silica nanoparticles with heavy crude oil to enhanced 
properties which are responsible for higher oil recovery was also studied. The stability of the nanoparticles in the 
xanthan gum polymer solution was identified by particle size and zeta potential analysis. The reduction in interfacial 
tension (IFT), emulsification of crude oil, creaming rate, rheology properties and wettability alteration of the system 
for polymer-nanoparticles synergy were investigated and based on which an optimum concentration of 5000 ppm 
xanthan gum and 0.3 % silica nanoparticles were obtained. The change in contact angle from 86.2 to 18.8° results in 
wettability alteration of the system from intermediate wet to water wet. The core flooding experiments performed 
resulted in oil recovery of 21% at 30°C and 19% at 80°C which clearly indicates the effective performance of silica 
nanoparticles at elevated temperature.

Abstract 
Hub facility location in this study is related with driving the traffic from origin to destination of the railway logistics 
transportation by finding optimal hub facilities and allocating demand node to hubs. The objective of this research is 
to determine the locations of hubs to allocate non-hub nodes to hubs with minimizing total cost. Total cost includes 
transportation costs from origin to destination and fixed costs for new hub investments. An approach to the capacitated 
multiple allocation hub location problem is presented and an integer linear programming model is developed to find 
the solution of this problem. Computational analysis is conducted in order to observe the resulting hub networks. The 
final results of this research are the optimal locations for railway logistics transportation transfer terminals attached in 
a hub-and-spoke network.

1. Introduction
Hub Location Problem (HLP) is one topic that is widely discussed in facility location problem. Hub facility is
defined as a place where all activities related to distribution, logistics, and transportation of goods for national or 
international transit are operated by a number of operators (Alam, 2013). In general, hub has three different function, 
namely: (1) consolidation or concentration function of flow received, to have a larger flow and let the economy of scale 
be exploited, (2) switch or transfer function that allows the flow to be redirected to the node, and (3) distribution or 
decomposition of large flow becomes smaller (Alumur and Kara, 2008). There are several main criteria that influence 
the determination of hub location, namely availability of labor, government and industry support, land availability, 
proximity to the market, and infrastructure facilities (Lipscomb, 2010). In addition, according to Handy and Niemeier 
(1997) there are additional criteria that can be used in determining the location of hub facilities which are accessibility 
measures. Accessibility measures consist of two parts, elements of attraction or activity and elements of transportation. 
The element of attraction or activity considers the spatial distribution of certain activities. While the transportation 
element considers the ease of travel to locations that are measured in distance, time or cost. 
Based on research Farahani et al. (2013) HLP can be used in several applications area including, airlines and 
airport industries (Yang, 2009; Qu and Weng, 2009; Costa et al., 2010; Lin, 2010), emergency service (Hakimi, 1964; 
Berman et al., 2007), post delivery service and rapid delivery packing systems (Ebery et al., 2000; Cetiner, 2010), 
supply chain management-logistics (Wang and Cheng, 2010; Ishfaq and Sox, 2010; Ishfaq and Sox, 2012), 
telecommunication service and message delivery network (Bollapragada, 2006; Kim and O’Kelly; 2009), transportation

5. Conclusion 
In this study, to solve HLP related problems in the delivery of goods by train is done with a capacitated multiple 
allocation hub location problem (CMAHLP) model using the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) method. The function 
of the objectives that have been achieved is the minimization of the total costs consisting of the cost of establishing a 
new hub and the cost of transporting the goods. The results obtained are PWS stations selected as hub facilities. The 
selection of the PWS station to become a hub, the total required cost of IDR 561,125,000, which previously amounted 
to IDR 586,072,500.

Abstract 
 
Industrial Engineering Programs are changing in the world pushed by technological trends, competitive 
pressures and new theoretical paradigms like Smart Advance Manufacturing, Cyber-physical Factory 
Design and other Industry 4.0 approaches.  
This work starts with a primary assumption: Learning approaches in engineering must to be applied in a 
different way before changing the contents of courses or the whole program.  
This work define two primary pedagological strategies to be aligned with needs and trends in the industry: 
the project based learning (PbL) and the problem solving based learning (PSbL); using a study case 
research method. 
Conclusions can be separated on two analytical dimensions: 1-Significative Learning for life and 2-
Technical Skills for Industrial Engineering Design. In the dimension number 1, PbL and PSbL must to be 
articulated between them and linked with real life situations. These should be essentially applied in a 
multi-disciplinary environment and with a strong follow up in order to get practical results. On the other 
hand, for technical skills reinforcement, PSbL must be mandatory and PbL a practical way in order to aim 
goals with pragmatism and tangible results orientation.  
In both analytical dimensions, the use of industrial standards and technical training needs should drive the 
learning objetives.

 1. Introduction 
 
Industrial Engineering is the science and profession that study goods and services production systems, specially the 
complex ones which require the optimal yield and integration of several resources such materials, money, 
equipment, economic resources, energy, people, infrastructure, information, technologies, etc. 
 
As other scientific fields, Industrial Engineering is built on core and formal paradigms (Kuhn T., 1962) that are in 
constant change influenced by other emerging scientific fields such materials engineering, foods technologies, 
mechatronics, ITC technologies and data analytics, robotics, artificial intelligence and cognition, green energies, 
cyber-physical systems, etc. Several changes and trends related with this knowledge fields can be associated with 
some industrial competitiveness big changes in the whole world and what some thinkers call “Fourth Industrial 
Revolution” or “Industry 4.0” (Frerich S. et al, 2016). 
 
This “paradigms” change introduce the need of re-thinking the concept and classical way of “industrial engineering 
education” not only in the perspective of contents but in the teaching and learning approach, integrated with research 
and social and community actions (Frerich et al, 2016).  That is why Industrial Engineering Programs are changing

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to justify that there is an absence of theory to fully convincing the relationship between 
Human Resource Management (HRM) and firm performance. This paper focuses on developing a conceptual 
framework as an effort to fill in the missing theory by discussing previous literatures, and therefore to suggest a 
conceptual mediating framework that complimenting all the findings from previous studies. Based on literature 
review, this paper hypothesized that HR roles act as a mediator that act as a sense of direction to improve firm 
performance.

1. Introduction
Over the past year, there were great deal of attention given when it comes to the study of Human Resource 
Management (HRM) and its efficacy to deal with the management issues within the organization (Voo et al., 2016). 
A considerable discussion in the area related to HRM discipline and firm performance has demonstrated that HRM 
practices are related to sets of organizational measures (Wright and Kehoe, 2008), particularly in lower turnover, 
productivity increase, and financial performance gains (Farouk et al., 2016). This is due to the modern study of 
HRM have emerged as relatively focusing on its impact on HRM as a key strategic to create value in a firm (Voo et 
al., 2016). 
Despite numerous studies which have been carried out on the relationship between HRM practices and firm 
performance, considerable issues remain unexplained regarding the intermediary variables that influence this link. 
Different studies came out with different framework (Theriou and Chatzoglou, 2015; Farouk et al., 2016; Matin-
Tapia et al., 2009). For instance, Theriou and Chatzoglou (2015) investigate the linkage between HRM practices and

Abstract 
Today’s organizational success are highly related to the value of competitive advantage through innovation. 
Innovation is one of the vital elements that contribute to the growth, competitiveness and survival of organizations 
in a world full of change. Supporting literatures proves that organizations becomes more innovative when they boost 
up and capitalize on their employee’s ability to innovate. One of the factors affecting innovation through individual 
is individual characteristics. Perceived by certain moderating agent, employee’s individual characteristic has 
important implication on how they react in innovative behavior. At the same time reward is said to play a vital role 
in boosting positive innovative behavioral among employees. This study aims to study on the individual 
characteristics of UTM Registrar Department employees and its effect on innovative behavior with rewards as the 
moderating factor.

Individual characteristics, Employee innovative behavior, reward, innovation 
1. Introduction
An individual is always influenced by their culture, sub-culture, social class, reference groups, family, personality, 
and psychological factors (Orji et al, 2017). Thus, understanding individual characteristics in an organization are 
crucial for continuous innovation and improvement where innovation proven as the crucial factors for the 
organizational financial result and economic sustainability (Monteiro, et al., 2017). To prove the interrelation 
between individual characteristics and employee innovative behaviour, this paper will serve as a report on the 
findings of innovation studies in UTM Registrar Office, and its impact to employee’s willingness to be innovative. 
In Malaysia, the Malaysian economy has evolved from solely based on production-based to knowledge-based 
economy to stay relevant with international achievement (Grapragasem et al., 2014) where education sector is 
recognized as one of the new economic engines to generate income and for sustaining economic development in 
Malaysia. The idea of practicing innovation in education sector is viewed as an important entity where it involves 
contribution to the individual competency to understand and implement implementation process of innovation, and 
how employees interact and communicate with others (Ujang, 2009). It is often the viewpoint of employees that

Abstract 
This paper is of design of an automated millet milling machine that targets the small-scale 
manufacturing. The demand of millet is high in the lowveld region in Zimbabwe and other arid 
to sub-arid regions in Asia. About 8 million tonnes of millet is produced in India per annum, 
accumulating to 40% of pearl millet’s global production. The existing problem is that millet’s 
demand is increasing due to health and food security reasons yet milling passes through many 
laborious stages and millet milling machines are relatively expensive to small scale 
manufacturers in developing countries. Data was collected from published scholarly documents, 
internet, experts in the field and local companies in the food processing industry. Extreme 
wearing of the rods with the hammers, development of cracks in neighbourhood of the holes 
contacting the rods to the hammers, with the likelihood of breakaway fracture and catastrophic 
results. Also, rolling contact bearings give difficult problems of balance uneven mass distribution 
and resonance. Numerous analysis of existing machine, use of local cheaper materials and 
combined mechanisms it was possible to produce a low cost and efficient product. The hammers 
hit the grains and shatter them before they can pass through the 0.5 mm hole screen surrounding 
the hammers. Hammer mill size reduction uses impact as the grain hits the projecting hammers, 
the screen material, and the mill cast iron casing. If this design is implemented, there will be

Abstract 
Small and medium enterprises are the main employment drivers of modern economies. Kuwait has the goal of 
developing a prosperous and diversified economy to reduce the country’s dependence on oil export revenues. Central 
Craft Company designs and manufactures commercial trucks and is considering expanding its business. Expanding a 
business before making a proper feasibility study may result in failure of the company, especially for small 
businesses. The main objective for this project is to increase the profit and increase the capacity of the company in 
order to stop rejecting customers as is currently done. The Central Craft Company may earn additional 21,000 USD 
per month if they serve all the potential customers they rejected. Steps of a feasibility study are followed including 
market study, financial analysis, sensitivity analysis and a new facility layout plan is made. Expanding the company 
to build a new facility with 5 truck work capacity with a layout for the new facility is offered as the most profitable 
solution and is robust under multiple scenarios.

Thermodynamic Modeling of Vapor Absorption Cycle-An Overview 
Keeping in view the scope and wide range applications of cooling systems and refrigeration cycles, there has always 
been a dire need of developing economic and efficient cooling systems. In this regard, current research paper 
provides an overview of how the optimization of vapor absorption cycle-the most economic refrigeration cycle-can 
be carried out and suggests the means of its thermodynamic modeling for obtaining its better output. This will lead 
to accomplishing the target of providing an economic and efficient method of producing refrigeration effect.

1. Introduction
Today, cooling (refrigeration) systems have gained vital importance in engineering arenas due to
their wide range applications in industrial sectors, especially thermal power plants. [Mali et al.
2013], [Xu and Wang, 2014]. It is also pertinent to mention that out of all the refrigeration
systems currently in practice at above mentioned engineering zones, the scientific community
prefers those which are highly economic and reasonably friendly towards environment [Young
et al. 2015]. Therefore, keeping the above mentioned context in view, Vapor Absorption
Refrigeration Systems (VARSs), ranging from small to large scale [Güido et al. 2018],
[Jayasekara and Halgamuge, 2014], being economic [Lethwala et al. 2018]and eco-friendly
amongst all the other refrigeration systems, absolutely meets the said demand criteria [Sharma
et al. 2012], [Srikhirin and Aphornratana, 2001]  - [Xu at el. 2013].
A Vapor Absorption Refrigeration Cycle consists of evaporator, absorber, generator and 
condenser [Srikhirin et al. 2001]. The refrigerant flows out of the evaporator and goes into the 
absorber. Inside absorber, the absorbent forms a solution by mixing with the refrigerant. This 
solution enters into the regenerator. The regenerator increases the temperature of the solution. At 
this point, the solution is rich in refrigerant and hence is called strong solution. This strong 
solution enters into the generator where it is heated so as to attain the temperature of the 
condenser. The refrigerant and absorbent are separated by means of a rectifier which is paired 
with the generator. The absorbent now flows out of the rectifier and enters again into the 
regenerator to increase the temperature of refrigerant-absorbent solution, entering into the 
generator, when the cycle is repeated. On the other hand, the refrigerant from the rectifier now 
passes into the condenser where its temperature decreases. In this way, each cycle of a vapor 
absorption refrigeration system is completed [Fan Y. et al. 2007]. A VARS is shown in Figure 1.

The thermodynamic model developed using EES, as shown in Figure 4, involved thirty-five (35) 
numbers of equations and thirty-five (35) numbers of variables. It was developed using the 
energy and mass balance equations, applied to each component of the VARS, TPS, Jamshoro, 
Sindh, Pakistan. The model was validated using the same software, viz EES. The validation 
results are clearly depicted in Figure 4. As shown by Figure 4, no errors in the thermodynamic 
model were detected.  
 
Conclusion 
This research paper presents the idea of thermodynamic modeling of Vapor Absorption 
Refrigeration Systems (VARSs) for improving their Coefficient of Performances (COP). The 
endeavor has been accomplished in previous research papers as well. However, this research 
paper offers a new approach for the development of thermodynamic model of a VARS and that 
is by using software called Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The model of a VAR developed 
using EES can be put to a parametric analysis which would help in suggesting design 
modifications in a VARS for the improvement of its COP.

Shopping centre in Malaysia plays a vital role in promoting economic growth and urban development. By 
the end of the year 2019, Malaysia will have close to 700 shopping centres in total net lettable area of 170 
million sq ft. Malaysia shopping centre industry offers more than 166.6 million square feet of the net 
lettable area with an estimated real estate value of RM130 billion. Retails contribution to the GDP could 
expand by 15 per cent from the current 10 per cent in the next five years and it could get better with 
tourism growth. For the second quarter of 2018, Malaysia’s retail industry reported a growth rate of 2.1 
per cent in retail sales, compared to the same period in 2017. However, Malaysia’s established centre 
operators recorded an average occupancy rate of 92% in 2018, according to a survey conducted by the 
Malaysia Shopping Centres Association (PPK). For 671 of shopping centres surveyed in the second half 
of the year, the average monthly gross rental rate per square feet of net lettable area was found to be 
RM7.87, while the average monthly expenses over the same area was RM3.07. One way to fill the 
centres, both new and existing, is tourism. The centres must be interactive. It must have things like 
artificial intelligence that interact with people. There should be new dynamics in shopping. Centre owners 
must keep abreast with the latest trends. Pricing and design must be right. Centres are also adding more 
food and beverage (F&B) outlets, tenants mix and branded outlets. The developers who are looking to set 
up centres should consider location and connectivity include concept, target market, mixture of tenants, 
security, parking, cleanliness and making the centres interactive. Given this context, this paper brings the 
Malaysian shopping centres into focus by classified based on ten categories including super-regional 
centre, regional centre, neighbourhood, community centre, lifestyle centre, factory outlet, hypermarket, 
plaza, niche and power centre. The categories based on size, criteria and function each shopping centre. 
The criteria of shopping centres were validated by expert panels using Delphi Method. Through the 
criteria, all the shopping centres were categorised in different groups. The study was the step to 
categorised shopping centre based on suitable categories and it is expected to provide insights to the 
stakeholders in improving their investment and business decision of the shopping centre in Malaysia.

Most Malaysian like shopping. Little wonder why Malaysia has 3 of the Top 15 world’s largest shopping malls, 
namely One Utama, Mid Valley Megamall & Gardens Mall, and Sunway Pyramid, all developed and managed by 
property developers who are long term shareholders of these prized assets. With the continuing population growth 
and urbanization, an increasing number of new and high-quality malls are being built in this country. Property

5. Conclusion
Finally, based on the categorization of shopping centre, there are ten (10) shopping centre in Malaysia including 
super regional, regional, neighbourhood, community centre, lifestyle centre, factory outlet centre, hypermarket, 
retail podium/plaza, niche/destination retail and power centre. All the shopping centre is a top 5 shopping centre in 
Malaysia based on size and criteria for each shopping centre. The criteria were come out from the literature review 
of shopping centre in over the world. The criteria and categorized shopping centre were chosen through the 
benchmarking analysis. Then, the Delphi Method was used to validate the criteria of shopping centre for the 3 
rounds. All the shopping centre was used as a respondents sampling for the next data collection. Each shopping 
centre has 10 respondents which are involve tenant, customer and worker. Since the shopping centre has 10 
categorize, the total is 440 respondents. However, this study to purpose for grading of shopping centre to help the 
owners rank portfolio holdings and shed low-scoring properties. Lenders use it in a similar manner. Retailers often 
use grading to help them evaluate the setting for which their stores exist. (ICSC, 2009). PriceWaterhouseCoopers 
(PWC) used expert opinion from retail real-estate-industry professionals to create a grading system for regional 
malls.  Although its survey-based system has been recast in mid-2009, PWC’s regional-mall classification remains 
based on sales-per-sq-ft evaluations, which is its shorthand for easy classification of a host of factors that would 
impact the sales performance. It can be betterment benchmarking for Malaysian property industry in general and 
expected to provide insights to the stakeholders in improving their investment and business decision of the shopping 
centre in Malaysia and also can be more attractive shopping centre for tourism purpose.

Abstract 
Railway transportation has certain characteristics and advantages, especially in its ability to transport both 
passengers and goods in bulk, saving energy, saving space, and using space. high safety factors, 
low pollution levels or more environmentally friendly and more efficient than road transportation modes. 
The advantages and characteristics of railways need to be utilized in an effort to develop an 
integrated transportation system. Therefore, the implementation which starts from planning, 
construction, business, maintenance, inspection and testing, and its operation needs to be managed as 
well as possible to be able to improve the provision of rail transportation services for the mobility 
of people and goods safely, comfortably, quickly, precisely , regularly at a cost affordable to the 
community. The construction of railway infrastructure and facilities both for passenger and freight 
transportation in Indonesia in the last five years had been prioritized by the Government of 
Indonesia. Railway development consist of the construction of Trans Sumatra, Trans Sulawesi, 
double tracking lines on Java and urban transportation (MRT, LRT). To anticipate the needs of railway 
infrastructure and facilities, supporting industries have also been developed, namely PT. INKA as a 
manufacturer of rolling stocks, PT. LEN as a signaling manufacturer, various railroad contractors. The 
development of the railway industry has a positive impact on the development of its supporting 
industries which can be seen from the employment opportunities, people's income and can be reflected 
in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

Abstract 
 
This paper proposes a Programmable Logical Control (PLC) based automated railway crossing gate control system. 
The existing conventional railway crossing gate control system in Bangladesh is being operated manually which 
causes increasing amount of accidents at the crossings due to the carelessness in manual operation. Also, manual 
mechanism is time consuming. The gate controlling mechanism should be carried out ensuring safety to the road users 
and guarantying less time during gate opening and closing process. In this work, a prototype road and rail line model 
with automated railway level crossing gate controlling mechanism has been designed and implemented. At the train’s 
level crossing arrival and departure side, a set of photoelectric sensors are strategically placed. Also for detecting any 
obstacles, reflective type photoelectric sensors are used strategically. The developed prototype system is simple, has 
fast operational speed and functions agreeably in laboratory setup.

 1. Introduction 
 
The development of an automatic level crossing gate control system has been an increasingly essential research interest 
over the last few decades. This geared up the researchers and scientists to work on developing automated procedures 
for level crossing gate control system. Different types of sensors have proven their importance by sensing qualitative 
and quantitative electrical signal for real life implementation. Bangladesh Railway has two different types of level 
crossing; Guarded/ Controlled level crossing & Unguarded/ Uncontrolled level crossing. In case of guarded level 
crossings, currently swing type gates, moveable barriers, or chains are used during the passage of train over the level 
crossing. The gate or moveable barrier is usually maintained and operated by railway watchmen. The watchmen make 
sure no train passes until the level gates of level crossing are closed by them. Theses gates are either operated manually 
or mechanically. On the other hand, in case of unguarded level crossing, no such arrangement is used this enhances 
the danger of accidents between the vehicles passing the road and moving train. Currently, 42 railway level crossings 
and 6 railway stations are available alone in Dhaka city between Jurine and Abdullahpur. Among them, 29 level 
crossings are authorized, 13 are unauthorized (Bangladesh Railway, 2008), 20 are connected with major roads and the 
rest 22 are connected with minor roads. Overall, Bangladesh Railway has almost 2541 level crossing gates, where 
1413 level crossing gates are authorized and 1128 are unauthorized. Bangladesh Railway has manually operated level 
crossing protection system where a person at the gate actuates the level crossing protection, acts when he receives 
communication from the signals room by means of a telephone call. Since it is mainly based on human operations, 
there is a likelihood that it may fail due to human errors. Due to some natural human errors train accidents have 
become very common especially in Dhaka city. Most of the unwanted events occur due to the lack of precise control 
of train engine, track and traffic gates/rail crossing. Sometimes, in uncontrolled level crossing, obstacle is present due 
to traffic jam and human error.

After the thorough laboratory testing of the automated level crossing system, it can be observed that the developed 
system operated satisfactorily. PLC based automatic railway level crossing gate control system ensure safety to the 
road users and deal with the time-consuming process of gate open and closing. This thesis aims at designing and 
constructing of a cost effective PLC based railway level crossing gate control systems. The proposed PLC based 
automatic railway level crossing gate control system ensures human safety. Also, it is highly reliable, has fast 
operational speed. However, PLC based automatic railway level crossing gate control system have high initial 
investment. The applications of PLC based automated system are huge in case of our country.  
7. Conclusion
A prototype automated level crossing gate control system has been developed with the aim of ensuring safety to the 
road users. The PLC based automatic railway gate controlling mechanism at level crossing can replace the manually 
operated gates functioned by gate keepers in Bangladesh. The design shows simplicity, reliability yet cost 
effectiveness in gate opening and closing operation.  The developed prototype system operated agreeably. The 
automated system if implemented can reduce a huge number of accidents & avoids the time-consuming process of 
railway level crossing gate opening and closing mechanism. This work can be further improved by implementing 
image processing technique in larger scale.

Abstract 
This research posits that the issue of accessible and inclusive developments (AIUD) is perhaps one of the most 
discussed and researched subjects under the broad rubric of sustainable urban developments. AIUD are developments 
that ensures accessibility for and inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of developments and follow 
universal design approach by removing barriers to the physical environment, transportation, employment, education, 
health, services, information and assistive devices such as information and communications technology (ICTs) to 
achieve fullest potential and dependency for all society members. In spite of the vast focus of discourse and practice 
or policy on AIUD, a major concern and rationale for this study is the poor or inadequate evaluation of AIUD 
governance evaluation, due primarily to lack of coherent, standard and applicable evaluation tool. AIUD is known as 
a dynamic complex environment involving multi sectors and multi stakeholders which leads to challenges for decision 
makers in successful implementation. Therefore, this research propose research methodology for developing a

4. Conclusion 
 
While Accessible and Inclusive Urban Development is gaining world wide concern due to states aspiration to comply 
with global movement driven by the United Nations emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals, active efforts is 
witnessed to develop policies and initiatives to implement inclusive developments. AIUD is a complex field involving 
multi sectoral and multi stakeholders with high uncertainty. Different fields with similar characteristics have utilized 
governance principles to develop governance evaluation models to evaluate governance performance in specific fields 
such as environment, coastal management, protected areas and transit oriented developments. Yet, regardless of these 
efforts, there is lack of governance evaluation models to evaluate governance performance in the field of AIUD.  
 
This research proposes a methodology to develop governance evaluation model in the field of AIUD using MCDM 
tools which will introduce a powerful tool to allow support to decision making and resource allocation, allow

Abstract 
Increasing in number of population and limited free land for development in Malaysia led to growing of more high-
rise and vertical housing. Rapid progress in housing development, life styles and increasing in living cost influence 
the purchasing of furniture to furnish their living area. This study aims to design and fabricate a contemporary modular 
study table for small living space in Malaysia. This study started by distributing the questionnaire to respondents in 
Maluri, Kuala Lumpur and Mutiara Damansara, Selangor. The design of study table is developed accordance to the 
data obtained through questionnaire. After the questionnaire data obtained and analyzed, the design processes are done 
started with ideation, design selection, idea development, mock-up and finally prototype fabrication. As responded by 
the respondents, a study table with contemporary design and modular concept is developed and fabricated to meet the 
demand of people. The outcome from this study showed that a contemporary modular furniture with study table as the 
main setting or function and the parts of this study table can be disassemble to form other furniture include a unit of 
short-legged table, two units of short-legged study table, and a unit of coffee table. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Increasing of Malaysia population and living cost has lead to the high demand of affordable housing mainly low-
cost housing. A low-cost house also known as minimalist house (either vertical or landed houses) have limited or 
small space area that require minimal number of furnishing and decoration. Thus, modular or convertible furniture 
can be very useful to save space for houses. Modular furniture is used widely because of its multi-purpose and space-
saving properties instead using a traditional furniture with only one function or purpose (Zhou and Chen, 2017). 
Modularity is an effective approach in organizing complex processes and products. Modular product is composed by 
modules that are “loosely coupled” and can be mixed and matched (Mikkola, 2006; Caridi et al., 2012). Contemporary 
refers to the present period and contemporary concept can applied either as direct or adaptive design (Hussain and 
Ahmad, 2012; Abdullah et al., 2013; Shuaib and Enoch, 2014). 
There are various types of furniture produced intended to support numbers of human activities such as seating 
(chairs, stools, and sofas), sleeping (beds), and eating (tables). Furniture can be made from many materials including 
wood, metal, plastic, ceramic, or composite. It can be shaped by using various techniques depending on the design, 
selection of material, shape, cost and many more (Melissa, 2010). Nowadays, there are countless design of study table 
available in the market. Table consists of a flat top known as tabletop and one or more legs (tabletop supporter), used 
for various purposed such as for eating, place things, study, working (drafting, architectural drawings and sewing) and 
many more. Some common types of table are dining room tables, beside table, coffee tables, refractory tables, 
workbenches, nested tables and also study tables. However, there are less study and design done on the modular study 
table that can be used for other activities and functions. Modular product design is becoming an attention and is 
frequently stated as a goal of good design practice in current furniture industry. Therefore, the focus of this study is to 
design and fabricate a modular study table and can be dissemble into other three types of furniture.

4. Conclusions 
 
In conclusion, a contemporary modular study table was designed and fabricated accordance to the data obtained 
from the questionnaire. The prototype of the study table was made from a combination of plywood as tabletop and 
compartments material and hollow square steel as frame material. The frame of the study table was sprayed with black 
color as finishing work. The modular practice is successfully implemented which the study table can be separated to 
form other arrangement of furniture such as coffee table or mini tables. In order to permits the modularity of the study 
table, special design on it frame was made by adapting Lego nature into frame design.

Abstract 
Inventory and production planning is one of important aspects that has to be considered in manufacturing industry. 
This aspect must be well executed for the continuity of manufacturing activities so that the company becomes 
profitable. This research focuses on safety stock planning and bottleneck that occurs on sand coated metal roof 
production at PT. XYZ. Occurring risk costs from non-optimal safety stock quantity and failures to achieve 
production target as occurring bottleneck on production are the main problems. Based on the chosen best 
forecasting method by analyzing the data, the optimal safety stock for maroon, black, green, brown, red, and blue 
sand coated metal roofs are 6098, 2196, 1585, 1796, 1267, and 604 consecutively. By using Theory of Constraint 
to minimize the occurring bottleneck on production line, the chosen best alternative is by recruiting 2 additional 
workers and 10 drying racks for production thus increasing company’s profits.

1. Introduction
An ideal manufacturing company must have good management system, such as in organization, planning, 
administration, and supervision. One of important sections of manufacturing activity is production planning and 
control division. Many company are still having bad inventory management so that cause inevitable cost such as 
shortage on raw material inventory, inventory cost for overstocks, and lost sales due to inventory stock-outs. These 
costs could be reduced, even eliminated by implementing appropriate inventory and production management 
system. Production obstacles could also emerge due to bad production planning so that the production target could 
not be achieved. 
XYZ Ltd. is a roofing material manufacturing company and coated sand metal roof is one of its products. Its 
production takes quite long time due to two steps drying which causes limitation in production capacity. Intuitively 
used safety stock quantity could cause risk cost such as overstocks, inventory stock-outs, and even aggravated by 
limited production capacity. Seasonal pattern on demand and preferred metal roof color. 
Calculation of optimal safety stock for each of metal roof color and bottleneck minimization is needed to solve 
these problems. Demand data, company operational cost, and its production process will be analyzed as data 
resources that can be used to help the company in the future. 
2. Literature review
Inventory management is defined as controlling responsibility and decision-making function that correlated with 
company inventory. A manufacturing company also needs appropriate production management to support the 
production continuity. 
2.1.  Forecasting 
Forecasting is defined as a systematic process that analyzes past history data and forecasts the future data with 
corresponding chosen method.

5.  Conclusion 
Based on the forecasting results of each sand coated metal roof, the optimal quantity of safety stock for maroon, 
black, green, brown, red, and blue metal roofs are 6098, 2196, 1585, 1796, 1267, and 604 consecutively.  
By using Theory of Constraint to minimize the occurring bottleneck on production line, the chosen best alternative 
is by recruiting 2 additional workers and 10 drying racks for production thus increasing company’s profits and 
production capacity. 
The suggestions for the company in future are to implement the forecasting method to get the optimal inventory 
level. For sub-processes in production that still need manpower, company is suggested to make Standard Operating 
Procedure so that the workers performance could be standardized thus achieve the production target.

Handling Heavy Metal Waste through Utilization of 
Lapindo Activated Mud HCl to Realize Environmentally 
Friendly Industries

Abstract 
Until now, one of the industrial problems (metallurgy, electroplating, electrical equipment, paint, 
pesticides and jewelry) is heavy metal waste. Some heavy metals that can cause adverse effects on the 
environment are Chrome (Cr), Lead (Pb), and Mercury (Hg). If the dangerous heavy metal is wasted into 
the environment, it can cause various problems in the environment and especially can threaten human life. 
Disorders caused include lumps, tumors, nerve damage, brain damage, and even death. Therefore, it is 
necessary to handle industrial waste before being disposed of into the environment to eliminate the 
content of Cr, Pb, and Hg, so that industrial waste is no longer dangerous for humans or the environment. 
Meanwhile, in Indonesia since 2004 there was an event of natural disasters, namely the Lapindo mudflow. 
Lapindo mud is a mud produced from a burst of volcanic activity with a volume of 5000 m3/day. This 
mud has great potential as a heavy metal adsorbent, because it contains polysilic minerals. Polysilic 
minerals when activated with strong acids such as HCl can produce polysilanol. Polysilanol is one of the 
most effective adsorbents for heavy metal ions. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 
concentration of activator (HCl) on the content of heavy metals Cr, Pb, and Hg produced from the 
industrial processes. The activation of Lapindo mud with HCl causes impurities in the mineral component 
to be decomposed and dissolved with the activator, leaving a lot of pore in the mud. Increasing the 
number of pores causes the surface area of the touch field of mud which has an active group of silanol. 
This results in a greater and more effective absorption of heavy metal ions. Heavy metal ions will be 
trapped in the pores of the mud which have many active silanol groups. The more silica found on the 
surface of the touch field, the more heavy metals can be absorbed during the adsorption process. In this 
study a SEM test was carried out to ensure the surface morphology of the sludge was successfully 
activated. In addition, in this study a quantitative test was conducted using AAS to determine the effect of 
HCl concentration on adsorption of heavy metals Cr, Pb, and Hg by activated sludge. Based on the results 
of the study, it was found that the mud had been activated as evidenced by the emergence of many pores 
in the mud. The pore diameter produced is classified into the mesopore type between 0.2 to 2.5 µm. 
Mesopori is a type of pore that is best at absorbing heavy metals. The other results obtained that the 
greater the concentration of HCl activator, the greater the binding capacity of the sludge to heavy metals. 
According to the results of this study, the best HCl concentration as a Lapindo mud activator is 0.4 M, 
because the activated sludge with this treatment has the best ability to absorb heavy metals Cr, Pb, and Hg 
up to 100%.

Abstract 
It is important to understand the ecosystem of the supply chain for companies that work with suppliers all 
over the world. The health of a global supply chain isn’t just measured by revenue and profit. A more 
relevant indicator is how efficiently capital flows between buyers and suppliers. Slow moving capital, much 
like slow moving inventory, creates unnecessary costs and inefficiencies in a supply chain. To operate the 
company more effectively, supply chain finance requires an ecosystem that improves the velocity of 
working capital across a supply chain. Participants of the system involves buyers, suppliers, funding 
providers and platform providers. The purposes of this presentations is to introduce the concept of supply 
chain finance in particular with the applications of block chain. The background of block chain is also 
introduced. A listed company in Hong Kong is used as an illustrated case.

Service Learning, Generic Skills, Teamwork and Students Graduate Attributes 
1. Introduction
The Centre for Co-Curriculum Courses and Service Learning (CCSL) is based in one of the Malaysia Higher 
Education Institutions. It runs a 2 credit co-curriculum courses and the course offered by CCSL is one of the 
compulsory courses for students to complete their undergraduate studies. One of the aims of CCSL is to manage and 
coordinate the co-curriculum courses in a service learning approach. The CCSL administration provide students 
graduate attributes rubric that students will need to achieve the aims through courses and co-curriculum activities in 
order to ensure students generic skills are developed. The CCSL aims to produce graduates who have students 
graduate attributes namely adaptability, communication skills, thinking skills, scholarship, leadership and team 
working skills. Service learning projects allow students to develop the generic skills that employers highly valued 
such as communication skills, team working skills, problem solving skills, enterprise skills, planning and organising 
skills, self-management skills, learning skills and technology skills (Hatcher and Bringle, 1997; Astin et al., 2000; 
Ropers-huilman et al., 2005; Bringle and Hatcher, 2009). Modern industries require graduate students with 
enhanced employability skills should provide generic skills as industry needs multi-skilled employees in different 
engineering disciplines (Markes, 2006). Joseph et al., (2007) stressed that the integration of service learning 
approach would result in future employees that would have skills and knowledge to perform well in the workplace. 
Employers today are looking for employees with 21st century skills and teamwork is the number one global 
workforce in the industry (Bates et al., 2004; Casner-Lotto, 2006). Most industry namely management, healthcare,

Abstract 
Tiles industry is the prime ceramic product which widely uses in Sri Lanka. Wall tiles, Floor tiles, and Roof 
tiles are the major products of tile industry outlet. In Sri Lankan building construction applications, ceramic 
floor tiles show a significant contribution when compared with other floor development materials. The 
present world is more concerned about environmental awareness with continuous growth unsustainable 
manufacturing practices. Therefore, many manufacturers are trying to create more and more eco-friendly 
processes and products by minimizing the effects of their activities on the environment. Although, as a 
developing country, the environmental performance of the tiles manufacturing sector and improvement of 
the product quality and performance are key factors to improve the sustainability. In order to go for a green 
future, it is needed to identify the environmental hotspots generates by the manufacturing sector. the product 
life cycle assessment (LCA) is an effective tool in the identification of environmental hotspots. In addition 
to that, it is required to model different life cycle scenarios for the improvement of Life Cycle Management 
(LCM). Therefore, this research focuses on conducting LCA towards eco-design in floor tile industry by 
using scenario analysis. Through this study, local floor tile industry can be driven to improve its overall 
sustainability of the floor tile manufacturing sector.

1. Introduction
All over the world Environmental awareness of the manufacturing sectors is considerable in the present time because 
of unsustainable manufacturing practices such as excessive raw material consumption, resource consumption, energy 
usages, inadequate waste disposals, Unregulated production processes, Adverse emission discharges in the midst of 
the production environment. Therefore, many manufacturing sectors are going towards the green manufacturing 
environment to have a higher level of appreciation by the society than other competitors in the market. Moreover, 
green Label is to direct manufacturers to review and account for the environmental impact of their products at each 
stage of the product's life cycle, from preproduction to disposal and it will increase the demand and eco-friendly image 
among competitors and global markets. Therefore, recently most of the manufacturers expect to adapt to the Eco-
labels and environmental product declaration (EPD). In fact, recently manufacturing of construction material is 
growing rapidly as its applications and needs dominate the whole world. But, most of the construction is predominantly 
focused on a profitable pursuit. Therefore, it is indispensable to concern about the sustainability of construction 
materials. In that respect, the ceramic tile industry also plays an important role in the context. Because ceramic tile is 
one of the essential consumer substance in Sri Lanka. When considering at ceramic industry it is produced as major 
products such as wall tiles, floor tiles, and roof tiles. Nevertheless, the floor tile is one of the important product among 
them which is widely used for building construction applications all in Sri Lankan. However, Ceramic tile is produced 
using completely natural resources such as clay, feldspar, silica sand and dolomite which is directly extracted from 
the ambiance. Further, energy consumption of the all ceramic tile industries are intensive such as liquefied natural gas, 
electricity which is a threat to the environment. In addition, auxiliary material applications such as packaging material, 
glazing and printing ink materials, raw material transportation from a significant distance and fired tiles and glazed

Figure 6. shows a section wise increment of global warming potential by 1% of error in inputs. It can be seen that the 
firing process has the most significant potential impact (0.06 kg CO2eq) on global warming by 1% of error in input. 
Afterward, spray drying is the second highest discharging process (0.03 kg CO2eq) to the environment. This figure 
clearly states that the firing process plays a vital role in environmental impact due to the LPG combustion process. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Global warming is the biggest threat to the world in this current period. This is due to the illegitimate manufacturing 
practices and enterprises as well as excessive resources and energy utilities. Therefore, such a comprehensive LCA 
can bring hidden environmental hotspot to the surface which is acting as a major role in environmental impact. In that 
respect, the environmental hotspot was identified through this study by referring ISO 14040 and 14044 principles 
which provide a guideline for LCA. According to the IPCC GWP impact assessment method, the firing process was 
identified as the environmental hotspot which is discharging high amount of emission (5.86 kg CO2eq) among the 
ceramic floor tile processes because the LP gas combustion processes rapidly increase the level of GHG emissions in 
the atmosphere and cause global warming and climate changes. As well as, when concentrating on the ReCiPe impact 
method, firing process acts as a major contributor to the environmental impact in all three endpoint impact categories 
such as resource, ecosystem and human health. Particularly, the resource category is affected significantly by the firing 
process among these three categories. Furthermore, the scenario analysis shows that the firing process discharges a 
significant amount of impact (0.06 kg CO2eq) and overall factory emits 0.142 kg CO2eq to the environment from the 
production of 1 m2 floor tile by an increment of 1% of error in input. Therefore, it shows that a small amount of input 
reduction can also be avoided the environmental impact significantly. On the other hand, a minor error in the LCI may 
direct to identify incorrect environmental hotspot. Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of LCI is very essential. In 
such cases, the parametric modeling would be the best solution to compare the performance when making changes in 
the product or process frequently and it is very beneficial to identify the eco-design possibilities during the design 
stage. In essence, it is evident from this entire life cycle impact assessment results that the firing process is the stringent 
hotspot to the environment. Therefore, in order to enhance the sustainability of Sri Lankan ceramic floor tile industry, 
it is essential to ensure the eco-design possibility to the firing process as it causes serious problems towards the green 
world.

Abstract 
With the advent of globalisation and fierce competition, outsourcing is considered as a smart management 
technique and a strategic initiative, which enables organisations to achieve competitive advantage in 
today’s market. Accordingly, most of the organisations from both private and public sectors have tended 
to outsource at least one of their services to outside service providers. Over the years, a number of 
researchers have discussed themes of outsourcing in different perspectives, and the aim of this paper is to 
synthesize the existing literature in order to provide a clearer picture of the outsourcing concept. Though 
outsourcing has been written extensively, as the researchers highlighted, most of the previous studies have 
focused on two key questions: ‘‘should we outsource?’’ and ‘‘what to outsource?’’. Therefore, this paper 
goes beyond what is often addressed in literature and discusses different definitions of outsourcing, the 
notions identified through those definitions, different forms of outsourcing, motives as well as the 
outsourcing process. While outsourcing involves two major parties, i.e. the Client; who obtains a specific 
product, service or a process and the Service Provider; who provides the said product, service or process, 
this paper discusses the above key themes from the Client’s point of view.  
Keywords  
Outsourcing Definitions, Forms of Outsourcing, Motives of Outsourcing, Process of Outsourcing 
1. Introduction
The concept of “Outsourcing” first originated in early 1970s in the United States (Magableh, 2018; Zitkienė & 2015; 
Bhattacharya et al., 2013) from the professional services and facility management (Magableh, 2018). Initially 
outsourcing was used as a quick and immediate meeting of a specific need or solving a specific problem, and its 
main premise was to limit costs (Deavers, 1997 as cited in Zelga, 2018; Harland et al., 2005 as cited in 
Bhattacharya, et al., 2013) and gain control over diverse businesses (Harland et al. 2005 as cited in Bhattacharya et 
al., 2013). However, as the technology developed, managers realised that the enterprises would not be able to be 
experts in more than one or two basic areas. That led the enterprises to renounce peripheral activities and to focus on 
elementary tasks which are the core competencies of them (Zelga, 2018). Over the last 50 years, outsourcing has 
evolved from the method used to implement simple business tasks to the concept treated as a mechanism involving 
strategic shaping of the structure of business operations (Zelga, 2018). Hence, the traditional rationale for engaging 
in outsourcing arrangements has now morphed into an inherently strategic activity (Bhattacharya, et al., 2013) and is 
gaining a considerable popularity in the field of business services and management (Galanaki & Papalexandris, 
3547",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Bangkok, Thailand, March 5-7, 2019

motives for outsourcing which include, for concentrating on core business, for using vendor’s competencies and 
facilities, for improved quality, productivity and operational efficiencies, for increased flexibility, for increased 
innovation, for transferring risk, for right-sized employees/reduced space, for improved customer orientation and 
service, as a solution for lack of initial and major capital investments for service provision and thus, to achieve 
competitive advantage. It could be identified that the process of outsourcing has not been given an adequate 
attention in existing literature and different ambiguities exist in the way that different researchers have categorised 
the phases of outsourcing. By carefully going through process models available in the literature, outsourcing process 
that covers all the phases that client goes through could be determined.  As per the process identified, it includes six 
phases, strategizing, scoping, evaluation and vendor selection, negotiation, transition, management and 
reconsideration. Though the service provider replies the client’s RFP during the evaluation and vendor selection 
phase, the interactions of the two parties are started during the Negotiation stage.   
 
Hence, the findings of the paper provided the whole picture of outsourcing including what outsourcing is all about 
and different forms of outsourcing arrangements available from client organisations, what are the expected outcomes 
of outsourcing and specially introduced an outsourcing process model from the client’s perspective. Thus, this study 
will shed light on the understanding the above-mentioned themes of outsourcing clearly which will support the 
research scholars whose researches are based upon those themes. Further, as it was mentioned earlier, this paper is a 
part of a large study intended to carry out on client-provider relationships in outsourcing and the above developed 
model including different phases will be used as the basis to evaluate the client-provider relations in outsourcing, in 
future.

Abstract 
The Assessment Institute for Foods, Drugs, and Cosmetics Indonesian Council of Ulama (LPPOM-MUI) has provided 
web-based information to help consumers to trace the validity of halal status on the product package. This research 
aims to examine and predict Muslim consumers’ intention to use the online search service to seek information 
regarding the halalness status of products. A research framework is created based on the Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM) and modified by adding one external variable, namely halal concern. Structural equation model (SEM) 
is applied to assess the model fit and to test the research hypotheses. The result of model fit assessment concluded that 
the proposed model is marginally acceptable.  The estimated model, however, found support only for the role of 
perceived ease of use (PEU) in affecting perceived usefulness (PU). Other hypotheses got weakly support since the 
relationships were in the predicted direction but not statistically significant. A little less than half (R2 = 0,486) of the 
variability in the online search intention is explained. This research is the first attempt to analyze the online information 
search intention regarding halal product status using TAM. This study provides new information in the emerging 
context of validating product halalness status.

1. Introduction
Halal becomes the greatest concern to Moslems when preparing and consumer products. Halal status of the products 
also becomes an important factor considered by consumers before deciding to purchase (Nooh, et al., 2007; Prabowo, 
et al., 2015). Consumers can get information about the halal status of the products from its package embedding halal 
logo and ingredients. Manufacturers use this halal logo as a marketing tool so that their consumers are assured that 
their products comply with the halal standard.   
In Indonesia, to display an official halal logo on product packages, manufacturers must comply with halal certification 
standard established by the Assessment Institute for Foods, Drugs, and Cosmetics Indonesian Council of Ulama 
(LPPOM-MUI) for their products. Halal Certification is a process to get the halal certificate issued by LPPOM-MUI. 
In order to get the certificate, manufacturers must follow several steps to verify that materials, production process, and 
Halal Assurance System meet to the standard of LPPOM-MUI (LPPOM-MUI, 2008). Product passing the halal 
certification procedure will get the halal certificate stating the halal status of the product, halal certificate number, and 
the validity period of the halal status. The validity period of halal status is two years and two months before the status 
is expired, manufacturers must request re-certification process to extend the halal status of the products.

© IEOM Society International 
Previously, LPPOM-MUI provided three services for validating product halalness status namely 1) short message 
service (SMS)-based service, 2) Android-based service which is called Halal MUI, and 3) web-based service. Currently, 
the first two services that have launched by LPPOM-MUI are unusable. Specifically for Halal MUI application which 
is Android-based, the features of this application are basically the same as the online search features provided by the 
www.halalmui.org. In fact, in the Halal MUI application, there were additional features of checking product halalness 
status through barcode scanning. Unfortunately, the barcode scan feature cannot work properly. The content inside the 
application was also not updated according to the development of the number of halal-certified products. In addition, if 
the user searched for product halal status and the product was not found, the application did not provide any response 
and only rose a blank screen. This made the users confused about the search result. Future research can be conducted 
to develop this Android based-application but more user-friendly ones and with more updated contents. Another 
application concerning product halalness status validation is an RFID-based application as developed by Nasir, et al. 
(2011). Norman, et al. (2009) in other research related to RFID concluded that RFID-enabled service in validating halal 
status was considered by the Malaysian user to be very useful and able to support Malaysia as a halal hub. 
 
Another finding of this result is about coefficient of determinant that is the degree of independent variables in 
explaining dependent variable. It was found that the model accounted for substantial variability in perceived usefulness 
and usage intention of online search service regarding product halalness status. Variable of perceived usefulness can 
be explained by halal concern and perceived ease of use variables by 84.5%. But the variables of halal concern,  
perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness together are only able to explain variable of intention to use by 48.6%. 
This research only extended one external variable, namely halal concern, into the original TAM. Subsequent research 
can expand the model by adding new variables affecting the user's intention to use online search services in validating 
product halalness status. Potential variables, like social influence (Rahman, et al., 2016), online service quality 
(Norman, et al., 2009), and innovativeness (Parasuraman, 2000), and their relationships need to be explored and 
integrated onto TAM in the future study. Another limitation of this research is about the small size of the sample. 
Future research is expected to use the larger sample size and broaden the geographical areas of the respondents in 
order to generalize the research results. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
The objective of this research is to examine and predict Muslim consumers’ intention to use LPPOM-MUI website to 
seek information regarding the halalness status of products based on TAM. TAM can be used as a framework for 
predicting Muslim consumers’ intention to use online search service although based on a review of the three types of 
fit measures, the proposed model only got a marginally acceptable fit. The result of hypotheses testing shows that among 
five hypotheses proposed, only one hypothesis, stating that perceived ease of use affects perceive usefulness, got 
strongly support. While other hypotheses were weakly supported because the relationships were in the predicted 
direction but not statistically significant. Another finding of this result is about coefficient of determinant in which 
variable of halal concern together with variable of perceived ease of use could explain 84.5% of the variance in the 
perceived usefulness, whereas variables of halal concern,  perceived ease of use, and  perceived usefulness together are 
only able to explain variable of intention to use by 48.6%. 
 
This research has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this research becomes the first attempt to 
analyze the intention to use online search service regarding halal product status using TAM and then extended the 
original TAM by adding one external variable, namely halal concern. This research also has developed measurements 
model regarding the intention to use online search service in validating product halalness status. This measurement 
model can be used in other similar research focusing on user intention to use halal tracing technology. This research 
finding increases the importance placed on “easy-to-use” of online search service being available to Muslim 
consumers. Therefore, it is expected that the government of Indonesia through LPPOM-MUI can provide similar 
services but easier to use ones in order to provide halalness guarantee toward Muslim consumers.

Abstract 
Pusat Inovasi Teknologi Sebelas Maret University (PIT UNS) is a university incubator that organizes 
technology transfer activity in Sebelas Maret University (UNS), Indonesia. The main goal of PIT UNS is 
to create a technology-based startup from UNS research results. As a new incubator, it is necessary to 
develop the system of technology-based startup development. This paper aims to conduct the development 
of the system by benchmarking study. The study starts with the identification of benchmarking target and 
subject. Then the data is collected, analyzed and integrated with a condition in PIT UNS to determine the 
best practice. After that, it is developed to create a framework system if technology-based startup 
development in PIT UNS. The system is validated by Focus Group Discussion and pre-implemented by 
using case study. The result generates a framework with seven main activities and eight Standard Operation 
Procedures (SOPs). From that framework, PIT officer and tenant able to identify the incubation position 
based on their feedback. In addition, management’s element analysis shows that the system should be 
supported by enhanced quality resources.

1. Introduction
Technology transfer service unit is necessary to support the technology commercialization activity. The unit will 
prepare technology innovation research product to be commercialized-ready in the business world (transfer research 
product to business activity). The common example of the unit is an incubator, also called as business incubator or 
technology incubator. The incubator is considered as the most appropriate choice to develop technology innovation 
and prepare it to survive in the business world (Albadvi, 2006). The growth of the number of a business incubator is 
continuously increasing and significant due to the development of research activity in the world (B. Becker, 2006). 
As the name suggests, the incubator will incubate technology innovation researches product to be matured and prepare 
it to get in the business world. University incubator gives technology transfer services to academician in the university. 
University technology incubator is developing as the shifting of the role of the university in recent decades (Bramwell, 
2008). University has an important role in, especially development of technology-based economy (Astuti, 2014). 
University as a regional research center has to keep develops applicable technology in the business world. Thus, the

PIT officer. It is still dominated by magister staff. And not all of them come from a business and management 
background. Although PIT officers have worth more publication about commercialization and incubation compared 
with another incubator officer in Indonesia generally. There is should be training for the staff about business and 
management especially for a start-up. 
 
Material aspect represents the main input of PIT: academician and technology. PIT has an advantage in the number 
of an academician. But the quantity of the academician does not represent the quality. Meanwhile, the number of 
technology is still low. Motivation to transfer technology result to be commercialized product should be enhanced. 
Machine aspect represents the facility provided by PIT. It can be facility owned by PIT (building, room, mentoring 
activity) and not owned by PIT (access facility by the partnership). Generally, the facility provided by the PIT is 
almost the same with another incubator. But the physical facility is still lack of usage. Money aspect represents the 
funding provided by PIT. The funding source of PIT majority comes from the government due to university status. 
The chance to gain the funding is same with other universities. But the UNS budget for commercialization activity is 
more than average university. It should be utilized optimally to support PIT activity and gain the goal.  Method aspect 
represents procedure in PPBT development. Some incubators have standardized the procedure in SOP and recorded 
as guidelines. PIT does not standardize the procedure and records it yet.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
As a new incubator, PIT UNS need to develop their PPBT development system. For the development, a benchmarking 
study is conducted. From the benchmarking study, there are eight subsystems in PPBT development system in PIT 
UNS. They are tenant candidate registration/collection, tenant candidate selection, technology transfer training, 
certification, and IP protection, monitoring and evaluation, funding, partnership, and exit strategy. By those processes, 
the UNS academician attached with the technology and their business idea will be transformed into technology-based 
startup or PPBT as the main output. But the system should be supported with the qualified resource in UNS.   
 
The system has been validated by FGD and pre-implemented by using two recent tenants of PIT UNS as the case 
study. Feedback from the tenant’s state that the system is able to help tenant identifying the recent incubation position 
and make the action plan. But it is necessary to explore the mentoring and coaching activity more deeply. 
 
As the future research direction, the system can be developed more deeply for each activity. Challenge to create 
qualified input source and environment in developing technology-based startup can be an alternative for future 
research. An analysis of the development of graduated startup after the incubation process is another option.

Abstract 
Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are not only used for the military but have also been applied 
to agriculture, energy, and transportation. One example of its application is by conducting environmental 
monitoring, agriculture, and survey applications. This UAV has very specific constraints on the driving 
force of the drone starting from the power needed, the costs incurred, its weight, and the durability of the 
flight. The main reason is the fact that UAVs are unmanned, so the weight is relatively less and does not 
require a life support system for the crew and passengers, making it ideal for this new technology. Also, 
fuel cells are still too heavy to push large aircraft; they have a lower power density when compared to 
conventional turbines. In this study, we want to see the development of the technical feasibility of lithium 
battery packs for drones / UAVs. Because in business developing this lithium battery pack can increase 
20% value-added products. The method used is a qualitative method by looking at and comparing similar 
companies. The purpose of this study is to see the technical feasibility of lithium batteries for drones with 
a technical review from the literature review and previous research. 
Keywords: Feasibility Study, Lithium Battery Pack, Qualitative Method, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle 
1. Introduction
Drone sales trends increase every year. Globally, the total revenue from this device will reach the market more than 
USD 6 billion in 2017. In addition, in 2020, the growth of drones will reach USD 11.2 billion. Based on data released 
by Gartner in February, in 2017 the sales of drones are predicted to reach 3 million units. Compared to 2016, total 
growth for this year could reach 39% (Yusuf, 2017). It is also an integral part of zero-emission transport systems using 
electric drives, whether hybrid petrol-electric, battery electric, or hydrogen fuel cells vehicles for road, rail or sea 
(Andrewsa, 2018). 
Technology is a systematic approach to build and improve the commercial value of technology produced by 
universities. The form of commercialization can be developed by the College (Nasution, 2009). Based on this 
understanding, therefore, in the development of lithium battery pack products for drones, it is necessary to use lithium 
battery pack products for drones. Hence, the products have an additional commercial value that can benefit later 
universities.

Abstract 
Business competitiveness requires high-quality human resources. Human resources as labor in the industry must be 
protected by the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) program. One important factor in increasing work 
productivity relates to work stress. If employees have the ability to deal with work stress, then work productivity 
will increase. This study aims to examine the effect of work safety and work stress on work productivity. This study 
uses survey method,  using questionnaire as a tool in collecting primary data. The data analysis used is Structural 
Equation Modelling (SEM). The test results conclude that OSH and work stress have a positive and significant 
effect on work productivity. The effect of work safety and work stress on work productivity is 20.19% and 43.16% 
respectively. The results also show that employees' ability to overcome work stress has a more dominant influence 
than work safety.

1. Introduction
Chevron Pacific Indonesia (CPI) is a subsidiary of Chevron which is tasked with exploring oil in Riau. Before being 
taken over by Chevron, the company was named Caltex Pacific Indonesia. CPI employees are placed in 4 cities in 
Riau, namely Dumai, Duri, Minas and Rumbai. CPI is also the largest contracting oil company in Indonesia, with 
production reaching 2 billion barrels. In 2005, Caltex, as a subsidiary of Chevron and Texaco Inc. was acquired by 
Chevron together with Texaco and Unocal. So, the official name of PT Caltex Pacific Indonesia changed to PT 
Chevron Pacific Indonesia (CPI). 
PT CPI, which is engaged in petroleum exploration, performs several stages of processes that use heavy equipment, 
chemicals, and high-temperature machines that have enormous potential to cause work accidents and work-related 
illnesses. Several stages of the work process in the Treat and Ship Operations section - Facility Operations starting 
from operating the Heat Exchanger Oil Treating Plant, operating the Gas Boot Oil Treating Plant, operating the 
FWKO Tank Oil Treating Plant, operating the Wash Tank Oil Treating Plant, operating the Shipping Tank Oil 
Treating Plant , conducts BS & W testing, conducts the Sand Trap and Waste Pit Water Treating Plant, operates API 
Separator Pit AB facilities and CD Water Treating Plant, operates Floatation Pit Water Treating Plant facilities,

Partially the direct effect of the work safety variable is 6.05% and the work stress variable is 43.16%. While 
simultaneously, the total direct effect of the occupational safety variable is 20.19% and the work stress 
variable is 43.16%. Simultaneously the total influence of the two variables is 63.36%. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Research 
The test results concluded that OSH and work stress had a positive and significant effect on work 
productivity, both partially and simultaneously. The effect of work safety and work stress on work 
productivity is 20.19% and 43.16% respectively. The results also show that work stress has a more dominant 
influence than work safety.   
 
The results of this study indicate that work safety has a relatively lower effect than work stress. On the one 
hand, this illustrates that OSH conditions in Indonesia are still relatively weak. Future research is needed to 
explore how much management commitment in day-to-day operations. This commitment illustrates how big 
the top management is to create work safety. Is there regular training? How big is the budget prepared? Do 
employees comply with the SOP? Research is important because it involves the safety and lives of humans 
and the positive impact is the better results of work productivity received by the company.

Abstract 
Indonesia's petrochemical sector contributes to 3% of Indonesia GDP and its demand should soon grow by 5% per 
year due to Indonesia's economic expansion.  This is correlated with the economic expansion of Indonesia, since 
petrochemical derivative products are utilized in the production process of plastic products, pharmaceuticals, and 
textile.  The Indonesia government put high effort on the integrated petrochemical industry development toward green 
industry in order to achieve better economic performance. The overall objective of this study is to draw the relationship 
between internal green supply chain management (GSCM) and external GSCM practices on economic performance 
of petrochemical industry in Indonesia. Internal GSCM consist of eco design and internal environment management. 
Whilst external GSCM consist of green purchasing and reverse logistic. This study was conducted among 
petrochemical olefin manufactures based in Banten Province Indonesia. The result showed that Internal GSCM has 
no direct effect on economic performance, but external GSCM has a positive effect on economic performance. The 
external GSCM practice implementation not only reduce any cost from waste treatment, environment accidents, and 
energy consumption toward profit achievement as well as profit growth over the years, but also generate sales and 
earnings.

1. Introduction
The petrochemical industry in Indonesia is one of the most important primary industries toward economic
growth.  It is the foundation of a wide variety of industrial production processes such as plastic and container, textile, 
rubber, agriculture, cosmetic, pesticide, cleaning agent, pharmaceutical, artificial skin, explosive material up to and 
fertilizer industries.  These industries then create value added to Indonesia GDP as well as for exporting value. 
Indeed, the petrochemical industry is the sector experiencing the highest growth in Indonesia. This is correlated with 
the economic expansion of Indonesia, since petrochemical derivative products are utilized in the production process 
of plastic products, pharmaceuticals, and textiles, amongst others. 
Rambu Energy (2014), stated that Indonesia imported raw material used by petrochemical industry around US$8 
billion since 2013. Hence, due to this imported raw material then upstream petrochemical industry offers thin margin 
and requires huge investment and advanced technology.  One of the strategies for being sustainable in the business 
particularly in the business margin is to have a domestic plant of raw material supply instead of import. There are a 
number of petrochemical plants have decided to expand their plant capacity or building a new petrochemical plant.

level in the manufacturing firms. Most of the petrochemical manufacturers objective of reverse logistics in line with 
the prior study by Christopher (2016).  According to Christopher (2016), the objective of reverse logistics practice 
was to maximize the activities taking place after selling the product such as customer service, warehousing and 
inspecting the quality which can act as another source of income, increase the satisfaction of the client as well as 
conserve the environment.  Thus an appropriate reverse logistics system should be designed to achieve efficiency and 
thereby, achieve economic benefit for the company (Govindan, et al., 2015).  
         Comparing all measurement of extent level external GSCM, the green purchasing still be the challenge to be 
fulfilled by the industry.  Green purchasing is about taking social and environmental factors into consideration 
alongside financial factors in making procurement decisions. Making decisions in this way requires setting 
procurement into the broader strategic context including value of money, performance management, corporate and 
community priorities (UN, Procurement Handbook, 2012).   
 
5.4. Conclusion   
 
     In summary, petrochemical industry in Indonesia is has a tendency toward fulfillment the green supply chain 
management application. Although, the petrochemical industry in Indonesia indicates that only the external GSCM 
practices affect the economic performance.  An earlier study of economic performance revealed that out of the four 
GSCM practices, only green purchasing was found to have a significant impact on economic performance (Younis, 
2016). On the other side, eco-design, which failed to impact any of corporate performance dimensions.   
     Hence, economic performance considerations should be taken into account in the petrochemical industry, 
considering the scarcity of natural resources and importance of this industry in development in one hand and 
environmental damage caused by this industry on the other hand. 
     Some indicators for economic performance might be used for the benchmark based on this study can be started on 
the successful of any new product launches as the impact of GSCM practices implementation subject to the green 
product or green production process. The external GSCM practice implementation could generate sales and earning 
toward profit achievement as well as profit growth over the years.  Because, it might impact customer satisfaction 
toward their loyalty to the firms. In addition, the process production might reduce   any cost / fee from waste treatment, 
environment accidents, and energy consumption due to the effect of external GSCM practices implementation.

Abstract 
Indonesia, have embarked on basic petrochemical product expansion.  Despite the effort for expanding domestic 
petrochemical plants, however, petrochemicals contribute to Indonesia emissions due to its relatively high share of 
biomass.  In order to prevent further degradation of the environment, Indonesia’s Industry Ministry has prepared a 
new regulation to set sustainability requirement and layout the incentive for businesses to help the country lower its 
carbon emissions by 29% by 2030.  Green Supply Chain Management plays the main role for the manufacturing 
industry to reduce the environmental impacts to the business which could reduce the business cost incurred to the 
business. The overall objective of this study is to identify the extent of external GSCM practices toward environment 
sustainability and to draw the relationship between external GSCM practices on environment sustainability of 
petrochemical industry in Indonesia.  External GSCM consist of green purchasing and reverse logistic. This study was 
conducted among petrochemical olefin manufactures based in Banten Province Indonesia. The result showed that 
External GSCM has direct effect on environment sustainability which supported by the Indonesia Ministerial Decree 
No 6/2013 regarding company environmental performance program namely PROPER program.

1. Introduction
Based on the KPMG Asia Pacific Report (2014), ASEAN countries, in particular, Indonesia, have embarked on
basic petrochemical product expansion. However, despite the effort to improve Indonesia’s petrochemical production 
capacity, these petrochemical companies also need to care and protects the environment with minimizing every 
environmental impact from its activities in which supported by Environmental Aspect & Impact Document to make 
sure its safety in order to prevent pollution. In order to compete sustainably in the evolving ecosystem, producers 
must adapt to their regional environments.  One of the longer-term goals of the sector are guided by the Presidential 
Decree No. 5/2006 on KEN emphasizes environmental sustainability concerns.  In order to prevent further 
degradation of the environment, Indonesia’s Industry Ministry has prepared a new regulation to set sustainability 
requirement and layout the incentive for businesses to help the country lower its carbon emissions by 29% by 2030 
(Jakarta Globe, 2017). Further, strategic plan 2015 – 2019 of Directorate General of Climate Change Ministry of 
Environment and Forests (Directorate General of Climate Change Ministry of Environment and Forests, 2015), has

Abstract 
Petrochemical industry plays a vital role in the economic growth of a nation then petrochemicals is also considered as 
a cost-based industry.  Indonesia has higher demand growth against the global demand growth. Therefore, to achieve 
the industry economic sustainability, it is a need to have a better management strategy toward production efficiency. 
Thus firms should try to incorporate the 4 Ps’ of marketing mix such as green product, green price, green distribution 
and green promotion into green marketing. The concept of green marketing mix pertains to the elements that are 
designed to achieve the strategic and financial goals of a firm, particularly in terms of reducing their negative (or 
increasing their positive) effects on the natural environment.  This study was conducted among petrochemical olefin 
manufactures based in Banten Province Indonesia. The result showed that green marketing mix directly has a positive 
effect on sustainability economic performance, environment performance and social performance respectively. In 
addition, green marketing mix has already started  to  be run within petrochemical industry in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
As petrochemical industry plays a vital role in the economic growth of a nation then petrochemicals is also considered 
as a cost-based industry.  Indonesia has higher demand growth against the global demand growth. Polyethylene and 
Polypropylene are examples of the products used to produce consumer goods’ packaging.  Therefore, to achieve the 
industry economic sustainability it is a need to have a better management strategy toward production efficiency. Thus 
firms should try to incorporate the 4 Ps’ of marketing mix such as green product, green price, green distribution and 
green promotion into green marketing. The concept of green marketing mix pertains to the elements that are designed 
to achieve the strategic and financial goals of a firm, particularly in terms of reducing their negative (or increasing 
their positive) effects on the natural environment.  
Bhalerao & Deskhmuh (2015) stated that various factors that influence environmental degradation could broaden 
to the meaning of green marketing. It is quite challenging for firms to see that products are produced in a way that not 
harm society and the environment but at the same time be profitable. The significant result relationship between 4’ Ps 
Marketing with sustainability performance of Bhalerao & Deskmuh (2015) research, motivate this study to find a 
model between green marketing mix role toward firm sustainability performance, particularly assimilation of green

5.2  The relationship between green marketing mix and sustainable firm performance 
As hypothesis H1, H2, and H3 indicate that green marketing mix directly have a positive effect on sustainability 
economic, environment and social performance respectively. Thus finding supports the sustainability literature. Such 
literature stated that green marketing encompasses marketing practices, policies, and procedures that take into account 
the natural environment concerns; these activities aim to generate revenue and provide outcomes that full all the 
product or product line objectives of both the organization and individuals. Hence, the concept of green marketing 
mix pertains to the elements that are designed to achieve the strategic and financial goals of a firm, particularly in 
terms of reducing their negative (or increasing their positive) effects on the natural environment. This concept is 
consistent with the view that each element of the marketing mix is created and executed in a manner that reduces the 
detrimental effects on the natural environment (Eneizan & Wahab, 2016). 
     The marketing literature indicates the advantages of pursuing green initiatives, such as larger financial gains and 
market share, high levels of employee commitment, increased firm performance, and enhanced capabilities. 
Environmentally responsible actions likewise increase customer satisfaction and firm value and reduce threats to the 
company, thus increasing firm valuations. Eneizan & Wahab (2016) research study on green marketing strategy 
concluded that green product, green price, green distribution, green promotion indicated that the green marketing 
strategy effect positively on the financial and non-financial performance of firms.  
5.3. Conclusion  
In conclusion, sustainability considerations should be taken into account in the petrochemical industry, considering 
the scarcity of natural resources and importance of this industry in development in one hand and environmental 
damage caused by this industry on the other hand. The petrochemical industry in Indonesia indicates that the green 
marketing mix role affect the sustainability of firm performance.

Abstract 
There are a lot of stories of security failures. In addition to attackers, lack of proper monitoring and controls 
implementation, and data breaches we are seeing these challenges and consequences. The security professionals 
are grappling to solve these issues. One of the biggest challenges with incident response is it is not the tool to 
identify them; it is the large amount of data that the environment has generated and how to accommodate and 
analyze the data. Analytics in the security sphere are working to creation of new rules, correlational aspects, 
trends and behavior patterns related to user behavior. In this regard, user-entity behavior analytics (UEBA) is 
one of the areas which researchers and practitioners are exploring solutions. UEBA can help in the security 
areas. UEBA focuses more on user actions and user behaviors and less on events. Behavior indicators and user-
entity first access anomalies are popular and deployed for ease of interpretation with malicious activities. UEBA 
has approached as a viable approach in the area of security to detect anomalies of user behaviors by statistical 
analysis and machine learning. The paper aims to show how analytics and specifically UEBA can help in 
detection. The objective of this paper is to systematically review the literatures to identify published analytics 
and specifically UEBA. As part of the UEBA literatures the authors looked at research literatures and articles 
beyond research papers. Searches were made from digital library of Amrita University and through online 
library database sources and references of eligible papers. The authors created a review process as a method to 
review the various literatures. For the research design the authors developed a matrix which has aggregated the 
various use-cases, vendors, the various solutions. The authors through the developed matrix also focus on the 
best practices across the industry and the various policies that have been developed and used across various 
industries. The authors also explored the various risks, technologies, data and the tools used in UEBA space 
across industry. The authors aggregated the analysis of 150 recent empirical studies, published in the last 10 
years, between 2008 and 2018, in the international literature on UEBA. The literature review analysis also 
focuses on ratifying and exploring the existing underlying theories related to UEBA. With the focus on user 
behaviors and the analytics related to user behaviors the authors look at the insights, benefits and the utilization 
of resources in the area of security.

Abstract 
 
There are various social media platforms that help various users to interact. Among the various platforms the video 
based platforms like Instagram are being used for business purposes. The aim of this paper is to analyze the use of 
online social networks as a medium for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) disclosures. These video based social 
media platforms have drastically changed the way various stakeholders interact with their stakeholders and 
customers. Many corporate organizations have started to adopt these video based social media platforms like 
Instagram to enhance their corporate social responsibility (CSR) aspects. To this end, an analysis was performed of 
the messages posted by the top 100 public listed companies in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India. In 
addition, analysis was performed on the responses that they received on two of the most popular online social 
networks Instagram. This paper adds to the ongoing development of the field of social media especially focusing on 
video based networks like Instagram. The motivation for the authors to perform this study is to identify and explore 
the gap particularly in the area social media related to Instagram and CSR due to mandated CSR in the Indian 
context. The authors in this paper review and analyze how online social media networks like Instagram are utilized 
for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. The researchers through the study of literature reviews found 
the gap in the area of Instagram and mandated CSR. There have been numerous studies by various researchers that 
have been investigated across the globe for the last 10 years on the areas of Instagram and CSR. The authors 
performed analysis on the messages posted by the 100 public listed companies. The authors analyzed the messages 
and their responses that were received on Instagram. The results of the analysis of these data are explored to see 
which of the Indian listed companies are using social media networks and which of the social media networks are 
most frequently used. In addition, the authors investigate which corporates adopted the online social media more 
effective and communicated the same to the stakeholders. The study also explored how Indian companies 
communicate more frequently the non-CSR messages more than CSR messages. In addition they also explored if the 
companies are employing an informing strategy or an interacting strategy. The authors analyzed the results of these 
data, and explored to see which of these 100 Indian listed companies are using Instagram frequently towards CSR 
activities. Using quantitative methods the authors tested and compared the results. The findings show how these 
companies are chaotic and unpredictable on Instagram. However, the CSR mandate has created greater awareness 
and that was evident from the results of utilizing social media platforms like Instagram after 2014. The findings 
show how this industry is chaotic and unpredictable. The study also shows how the Indian companies are 
transitioning and adopting these social media platforms is used for CSR activities. The findings revealed that the 
companies are consciously utilizing Instagram platforms towards their CSR practices. The authors use stakeholder 
theory as the research framework and developed the stakeholders accordingly.

Abstract 
 
In recent years security has been viewed in the context of securing the environment. Vulnerability Management 
(VM) in IT, Software and Technology areas is more of a static technology. However, the growing technology 
environment requires a combination of both static and dynamic technology.  To stay relevant and current VM 
needs to match the dynamics of heterogeneous and a complex environment. The dynamic complex and a 
heterogenous environments include, cloud platforms, IT systems and the rise of IOT and various electronic 
devices. The various players in the VM value chain need to realize that the value of their platforms and/or 
solutions is in the intelligence that they are building to address the whole VM value chain, which is incident 
detection, log correlation, triage/investigation and remediation. In addition to attackers, lack of proper 
monitoring and controls implementation, and data breaches are some real challenges. One of the biggest 
challenges is the large amount of data that the heterogeneous environment has generated and how to 
accommodate and analyze this data. Researchers are using and working on analytics in the security sphere to 
create new rules, correlational aspects, trends and behavior patterns specifically related to area of vulnerability 
management. Vulnerability management analytics is one of the areas which researchers and practitioners are 
exploring solutions. A systematic review of literature is conducted to investigate the various problems, tools, 
technology and data. The study through the digital library of Amrita University and through online library 
database extracted from various respectable sources. The objective of this paper is to systematically review the 
literatures to identify published in vulnerability management as well as the analytics involved in the 
vulnerability management area. As part of the literatures the authors looked at research literatures and articles. 
The authors created a systematic review process as a method to review the various literatures. For the review 
process design the authors developed a matrix that has aggregated the various problems, use-cases, risks, 
technology applied, data, and the various tools. In the matrix the authors also focused on the best practices 
across the industry and the policies that have been developed and used across various industries. The authors 
also aggregated the various the above parameters across strategic, tactical and operational dimensions. The 
authors also expanded the dimensions across business, technology and people. The authors finally explore the 
reviews from detection, through prognosis, impact, solutions and finally into implementation. The authors could 
not explore the costs and the various cost-benefits. The authors aggregated the analysis of 150 recent empirical 
studies, published in the last 10 years, between 2008 and 2018. The literature review analysis also focused on 
exploring the existing underlying theories related to vulnerability management. With the focus on vulnerability 
management and the analytics related to vulnerability management the authors look at the insights, benefits and 
the utilizations of the various resources in the area of security.

Abstract 
 
Business organisations have moved from simple philanthropic activities to social responsibility. These business 
organisations are not only integrating social aspects within the company’s overall strategy but also towards country’s 
social initiatives and UN’s development goals. The authors main objective of this paper is to study and analyze the 
social factors related to healthcare within the realm of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The understanding of 
healthcare from a social aspect broadens the engagement from the development aspect. It also ensures the corporations 
involvement and inclusion within the social sector as well as their role in societal impact. With the introduction of 
mandated CSR it has forced corporates in India to ensure social aspects of CSR are towards the development needs 
of nation. The motivation for the authors to perform this study is to understand the various social factors related to the 
healthcare area particularly after mandated CSR in Indian. The researchers through the study of literature reviews 
found the gap specifically in the area of healthcare factors related to sustainable development as well county’s focus 
towards development after the introduction of mandated CSR. There have been limited studies by various researchers 
that have been investigated across the globe specific to this gap. The authors performed an exhaustive overview and 
review of more than 100 research papers and found that there are limited studies that explain the linkage for Indian 
companies especially after the mandated CSR. The authors sample comprises of 125 listed companies out of the 500 
listed companies in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The 125 listed companies are across various 
industries and sectors and sub-sectors. The authors in this study used the content analysis method to extract the 
information from annual reports and websites of the 125 NSE-listed companies in India. The collected information 
was analyzed using basic statistical methods. The authors use stakeholder theory as the research framework and 
developed the stakeholders accordingly. The authors use the various healthcare related CSR parameters for the study. 
The authors use 2 years for this study, 2014, the year before mandate and 2018, the year after mandate. The authors 
perform analysis and compare the factors before and after the mandate. Though some earlier studies have found that 
there is little difference in the CSR practices of Indian companies due to mandate, however, the mandate has created 
greater awareness and that has created many implications towards decision making towards CSR. In this paper the 
authors explore the companies across various industries and how, when and where the Indian companies are allocate 
their CSR Spend budgets specifically related to healthcare aspects. This study will ultimately help the various 
companies to consciously allocate the CSR budgets towards their CSR healthcare practices not only to create a 
maximum impact as per the government mandate but also to ensure they are towards development and alignment with 
UN’s SDG goals.

Abstract 
 
The web2.0 has already produces a couple of social media platforms that helps them to interact. Various 
stakeholders and business organizations are using social media platform not just for casual interactions but also for 
business purposes. In the interconnected world these various social media platforms have drastically changed the 
way various stakeholders interact, communicate and connect with each other. In this process many corporate 
organizations have started to adopt these social media platforms towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
aspects. This paper adds to the ongoing development of the field of social networks. The motivation for the authors 
to perform this study is to identify and explore the gap particularly in the area social media and CSR due to 
mandated CSR in the Indian context. The purpose of this paper is to review and analyze how online social media 
networks are being utilized as platform for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) disclosures. The researchers 
through the study of literature reviews found the gap in the area of social media and mandated CSR. There have 
been numerous studies by various researchers that have been investigated across the globe for the last 10 years on 
the areas of social media and Corporate Social Responsibility. The authors performed analysis on the messages 
posted by the 165 public listed companies on these social media platforms in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 
India. The authors analyzed the messages and their responses that were received on two of the most popular online 
social networks, Facebook and Twitter. The authors analyzed the results of these data, and explored to see which of 
these 165 Indian listed companies are using social media networks and which of these social media networks are 
most frequently used. In addition, the authors also investigated to see how many of the 165 companies in India have 
adopted these two online social media more effectively and communicated the same to the stakeholders. The study 
also explored how Indian companies communicate more frequently the non-CSR messages more than CSR 
messages. The study also explored if the companies are employing an informing strategy or an interacting strategy 
towards external publics. Using quantitative methods the authors test and compare the results. The authors primarily 
exploit the new mandate for this study. The findings show how this industry is chaotic and unpredictable. The study 
also shows how the Indian companies are transitioning and adopting these social media platforms is used for CSR 
disclosures. However, the mandate has created greater awareness and that was evident from the results of utilizing 
social media for CSR after 2014. The authors use 3 time periods, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The findings revealed that 
the companies are consciously utilizing these social media platforms towards their CSR practices. The authors use 
stakeholder theory as the research framework and developed the stakeholders accordingly. The unique aspects of 
this paper are it divulges the details of the various companies across various industries and their impact on CSR due 
to social media. The paper contributes to the CSR literature as it presents empirical evidence of the influence of 
social media on CSR on practices in a developing country like India that has a mandated setting towards CSR.

Abstract 
 
Corporate Governance deals with ways to deal specific aspects of effective strategic decision making to ensure 
efficiency as well as add value to shareholders. There are many aspects and dimensions within Corporate 
Governance, one of the important and relevant aspects is Whistleblowing mechanism in the current situation 
and scenario in India. Whistleblowing mechanism plays a crucial role in enhancing the Corporate Governance 
mechanism standards of the company, though it is not a mandatory mechanism as per Companies Act clause-49 
requirement. Given the prevalence of corporate frauds, whistleblowing has become an important mechanism. 
Some of the largest frauds across the globe have been detected through whistleblowing mechanism. Despite the 
global recognition and importance given to the whistleblowing mechanism India has had very little success 
stories. The authors main objective of this paper is to study and analyze the specific aspects within Corporate 
Governance (CG). The present study explores and analyses the concept and the impact of whistleblowing in 
India. The authors also suggest remedies within the whistleblower program and how to protect the 
whistleblowers. The motivation for the authors to perform this study is to specifically focus on whistleblowing 
in the private Indian companies and compare them to the government owned companies. The researchers 
performed a thorough study of literature reviews and found the gap specifically in the area of whistleblowing 
within the private companies in India. The researchers also found that there have been limited studies that have 
been investigated across the globe and compared to the Indian context with respect to whistleblowing. The 
authors performed an exhaustive overview and review of more than 100 research papers on the broad areas of 
whistleblowing and found that there are limited studies that specifically analyze the private and government 
companies in India. The authors sample comprises a total of 100 companies which have 53 CPSE which are 
Government Owned and 50 private owned companies. The 50 private owned are the 50 listed companies from 
NIFTY-50 Index from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India and the 53 CPSE companies are the listed 
CPSEs companies from NSE India. The total 103 listed companies are across various industries and sectors and 
sub-sectors. The authors use the year 2018 for the study. The authors have resorted to primary and secondary 
sources of information for data. The primary sources of data are the Whistle Blowers Protection Act (WPA) 
2011, Whistleblowers Protection Act (WPA) 2014, Right to Information Act (RTI) 2004, Public Grievances and 
the secondary sources of data are from various research papers, books, websites, annual reports and articles. The 
authors reviewed and analyzed all the complaints and the nature of complaints received by each of these 100 
companies. The various natures of complaints were corruption allegations, improper conduct at workplaces, 
sexual harassment cases, financial impropriety and false employee credentials. The authors compared the nature 
of complaints between the private and governments companies and to explore and see if any particular type has 
more complaints. The authors in this study used the content analysis method to extract the Whistleblower

Abstract 
Willful Default is a problem faced by lenders across the world. The willful default issue is broadly a part of 
Moral Hazard issue. Willful default issues originated in academic literatures a few decades ago, specifically 
referring to the Moral Hazards, however there are very few literatures specifically to measure the same at the 
level of lenders as well as receivers. The authors main objective of this paper is to study and analyze certain 
aspects related to willful default within the broad realm of moral hazard. Within the moral hazard and 
specifically within the willful default aspects the authors are focused on Non-Performing Assets (NPA) 
management and NPA related to willful default. There are many dimensions within Non-Performing Assets 
(NPA) management; one of the important and relevant aspects is willful defaulter aspect in the current situation 
in India. Some of the largest cheating/loan frauds across the globe have been detected through willful default 
mechanism. Despite the global recognition and importance given to the willful default mechanism India has had 
very little success stories. Given the prevalence of NPA management as well as the willful default related 
specifically to NPA management it has become an important aspect for Indian banks to develop and implement 
mechanisms that will not only identify but also enhance the operations and deny further access. The motivation 
for the authors to perform this study is to specifically focus on willful default by the Indian banks and also the 
Indian companies and compare these banks and companies to the corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
activities that these banks and companies are spending and focusing their social responsibility activities. The 
researchers performed a thorough study of literature reviews and found the gap specifically in the area of willful 
default and related these to Social Responsibility (CSR) within the Indian banks and the Indian companies. The 
researchers also found that there have been limited studies that have been investigated across the globe and 
compared to the Indian context with respect to the relationship of willful default and CSR. The authors 
performed an exhaustive overview and review of more than 100 research papers on the broad areas of willful

Abstract 
 
The authors main objective of this paper is to study and analyze the Corporate Social Responsibility 
Performance (CSRP) through the relationship of Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) and Corporate Social 
Responsibility Spend (CSRS). The authors in this paper attempt to find out if CSR helps in creating value 
through CSR Performance and through Corporate Social Financial Performance (CFP) specifically using CSR 
Spend. The motivation for the authors to perform this study is to identify and explore the gap particularly in the 
area of mandated CSR in the Indian context. The researchers through the study of literature reviews found the 
gap in the area of mandated CSR. There have been numerous studies by various researchers that have been 
investigated across the globe for the last 20 years on the relationship of Corporate Social Responsibility with 
specific focus on Corporate Social Responsibility Performance and Corporate Social Responsibility Spend. The 
authors performed an exhaustive overview and review of more than 100 research papers on the above linkage of 
CSRP, CFP and CSRS interestingly found that there are no more than 3 studies that explain the linkage for 
Indian companies especially within the Indian context. The authors explored the study of relationship using 
content analysis, basic statistical methods and ANOVA for analysis. The authors sample comprises of 125 listed 
companies out of the 500 listed companies in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The 125 listed 
companies are across various industries and sectors and sub-sectors within the various industries. Using 
statistical methods the authors test and compare the CSR Performance of the companies before the mandate and 
after the mandate. The authors primarily exploit the new mandate for this study. The authors use the CSR Spend 
as well as the CSR Financial parameters (CFP) to analyze the CSR Performance. The authors use 2 time 
periods, year before mandate i.e. 2013 and the year after mandate i.e. 2018 for comparison. The authors use 
stakeholder theory as the research framework and developed the stakeholders accordingly. The study finds that 
there is little difference in the CSR practices of Indian companies due to mandate. However, the mandate has 
created greater awareness and that was evident from the CSR Spend. The findings also revealed that the 
companies are consciously allocation CSR budgets towards their CSR practices. Though there are no evident 
and clear either from the companies, not from the industries or from the sectors towards mandated CSR 
Performance. The unique aspects of this paper are it divulges the details of the various companies across various 
industries and their impact on CSR Performance due to mandate. The paper contributes to the CSR literature as 
it presents empirical evidence of the influence of CSR spend on CSR practices and CSR performance in a 
developing country like India that has a mandated setting towards CSR.

Abstract 
 
The authors main objective of this paper is to study and analyze the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and 
integrate them into the company mainstream strategy, which is a complex task. Practical implementation and 
execution of CSR requires analysis of both internal and external environments of the organizations stakeholders, 
determine the challenges and finally executing. The integration of decision making process into Corporate Social 
Responsibility (CSR) and sustainable development for decision making of activities, tasks, resources, funds or 
location is generally not supported through a decision making or a decision support system. The motivation for the 
authors to perform this study is to integrate decision support systems particularly towards the area of mandated CSR 
in the Indian context. The researchers through the study of literature reviews found the gap specifically in the area of 
decision support system integrated in the area of mandated CSR. There have been limited studies by various 
researchers that have been investigated across the globe on the integration of decision support systems within 
Corporate Social Responsibility. The authors performed an exhaustive overview and review of more than 100 
research papers on the areas of decision support system integration with CSR and found that there are limited studies 
that explain the linkage for Indian companies especially within the Indian context and more specifically after the 
mandate. The authors sample comprises of 125 listed companies out of the 500 listed companies in the National 
Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The 125 listed companies are across various industries and sectors and sub-sectors. 
In order to overcome simple single criteria decision model, this paper proposes a simple mutiple criteria integrated 
framework model to prioritize and select CSR programs to be implemented. The authors in this study used the 
content analysis method to extract the CSR related information from annual reports and websites of the 125 NSE-
listed companies in India. The collected information was analyzed using basic statistical methods. The authors 
primarily exploit the new mandate for this study. The authors use stakeholder theory as the research framework and 
developed the stakeholders accordingly. 
The authors use various CSR parameters for the study like CSR Spend, CSR Thematics Activities/Tasks, Location, 
and Company’s Core Area of Business etc as various parameters for decision-making. The authors use the year after 
mandate i.e. 2018 for the study. Though some earlier studies have found that there is little difference in the CSR 
practices of Indian companies due to mandate, however, the mandate has created greater awareness and that has 
created many implications towards decision making towards CSR. In this paper the authors using the various CSR 
parameters for the companies and across various industries they develop a simple decision making grid/system 
which helps the various stakeholders to quickly make decisions on how, when and where to allocate their CSR 
Spend budgets. The decision making system allows the various companies to consciously allocation the CSR 
budgets towards their CSR practices in order to create a maximum impact and also ensure they are complying as per

Human Resource Management is the process of recruitment and selecting employee, providing 
orientation and induction, training and development, assessment of employee, providing compensation 
and benefits, motivating, maintaining proper relations with employees and with trade unions, maintaining 
employees safety, welfare and health measures in compliance with labor laws of the land. The planning 
function of management controls all the planning that allows the organization to run smoothly, Staffing, 
Coordinating, and Controlling. HR practices can made simple with the emergence  of new technology like 
Block chain, it is a open decentralized database of any transaction involving value money goods or even 
votes creating a record whose authenticity can be verified by the entire community, transactions can be 
recorded on a public and distributed ledger which will be accessible by anyone. Block chain is an 
electronic ledger of digital records, events, or transactions that are hashed cryptographically, 
authenticated, and controlled through a distributed or shared network of participants using a group 
consensus protocol. The block chain is distributed among millions of computers with mechanisms for 
validating transactions that utilize a group consensus protocol. Block chain technology is the way of 
looking differently the inner functions of the normal database which gives the power to a single authority 
like administrators who have the ability to change the information in the database if they want to. This 
power can be abused by unfaithful administrators. Normal database suffers the problem of single point of 
failure and makes them depend much on backups in case of failure and when both running database and 
backups are harmed can bring very serious problem the block chain works differently compared to normal 
database whereby the information is encrypted and stored in every node connected to the network and 
eliminate the possibility of having single point of failure, fraud, and corruption. Block chain is more 
commonly associated with areas like payments and capital markets, its effects on HR will be profound 
and pervasive. HR functions should consider the benefits block chain delivers such as trustworthy 
verification of counter parties, identify without the involvement of a third party, giving people a 
comprehensive, trust worthy block chain-based record of their education, skills, training and work place 
performance. The objective of this paper is to understand the scope and awareness of Block chain among 
HR executives and also to check whether the HR executives are willing to adopt block chain in future.

Abstract 
The article delineates a scaffold for analyzing the outcome based course objectives and ascertain the variance among 
unit, module and course level objectives with reference to the Bloom’s taxonomy using pedagogic framework. It also 
investigates the correlation across the objectives at the course, module and unit levels. The key emphasis of the study 
is to develop a methodology to help the developer write objectives in an appropriate manner in engineering education 
system.

1. Introduction
Graduates of the 21st century should have the ability to arrive at informed judgments – that is, to effectively define
problems, gather and evaluate information related to those problems and develop solutions. The graduate engineers 
need to have proven abilities not only in remembering and understanding the essential knowledge and applying various 
concepts, principles and theories learnt in the university, but also in analyzing complex engineering problems, 
synthesizing appropriate solutions, evaluating various alternative approaches and processes. This is the crux of the 
Washington Accord [1], which has also been accepted by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in India [2]. 
So far education in India has been largely teacher-centric. Teachers decide what to teach and how to teach; a syllabus 
is often no more than a list of topics, allowing different interpretation by different students and teachers. Students rarely 
have any idea about what is expected of them, until the course is over, and more often than not until they see the final 
examination paper. Most courses are taught to familiarize students with these topics rather than offering specific 
learning objectives that they would have to attain. 
The emphasis is often on the ability to recall information, explain and at best apply some of the concepts learnt in 
class. Development of analysis, synthesis and evaluation skills rarely get the priority that they deserve. Encouraging 
active learning, teaching self-learning skills, effective communication skills, working in interdisciplinary groups are not 
practiced as a matter of policy. With the increase in popularity of web-based course delivery techniques in tertiary 
education, many university educators and curriculum designers are revisiting various course components. Learning 
activities, course outcomes, evaluation tools, communication techniques and assessment tasks are all under the 
pedagogical microscope. The Washington Accord, signed in 1989, was effectively the first major attempt to establish a 
benchmark for not only the level and content of the domain knowledge in a programme but also soft skills essential to 
learning development. 
2. Background of study
The more conventional definitions depict pedagogy as either the science/theory or art/practice of teaching that makes 
a difference in the intellectual and social development of students. Today it means creating an educational process that 
will need to knowledge transfer to a new learner. It refers to how teachers influence the learning process. It comes from 
the idea that the whole point of teaching should be centered on what kind of learning takes place, i.e. the lessons should 
be learner-centered and not teacher-centered. More specifically, new research is defining pedagogy as “a highly

6. Conclusion 
As per the Washington Accord, the graduate engineers need to have competencies in terms of grasping the 
essential knowledge, conceptualizing it, and applying the concepts learnt in analyzing complex engineering problems 
to synthesizing appropriate solutions and evaluating various alternative approaches and processes. In order to achieve 
this objective, the engineering courses should be developed as per pedagogic framework, where the course is designed 
in modular fashion and which is further discretized in small units. The outcome based instructional objectives are set in 
terms of the pedagogic structure, at course, module and unit level with a strong correlation between these at all level.  
In the present work, a course Energy Technology has been developed as per the pedagogic framework and has 
been tested using a Shikshan software tool. It has been observed that from a pedagogic perspective and cognitive level 
context, there is a near to perfect correlation between course, and module level. At the same time, there is a very good 
correlation between module and unit level as well.  
The present and future educational needs command that courses for an engineering degree programme must 
encourage higher levels of cognitive learning. Thus it is essential to select instructional objectives with major emphasis 
on the higher level of cognitive skills such as the ability to analyze, synthesize and evaluate problems and present 
solutions. Higher cognitive levels were attained at the course and module level in this example course presented. 
However, at unit level, certain portion at lower cognitive level ushers deeper understanding of the course.  
In the present era of information technology, the self and quick learning is the mantra. When ocean of information 
is available at the fingertip, such student centric course content developed using pedagogic framework under 
Washington accord gives opportunity to the learner to achieve one’s objectives quickly without entering into 
conventional monotonous and time consuming traditional modes of learning.

Entrepreneurship education is able to encourage students to become educated entrepreneurs and that the selection 
of sorghum-based products in entrepreneurship classes must be supported by a series of sustainable research 
activities, so that they can create new entrepreneurs with sorghum-based products, which can eventually be 
upgraded to sorghum-based industries including products, analysis business, market opening, and infrastructure 
development, so sorghum as an alternative food can support food security (Menrad, 2003; Noerhartati, 2017; 
Tjatusari and Noerhartati, 2017). 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
Entrepreneurship education at the university which is a sustainable teaching and learning activity with sorghum-
based entrepreneurship materials including grains, rice, flour, bran, and bran, which produce food products are 
various cakes, breads, cookies, functional drinks, ""tempeh"", and ""tape"", which ultimately the sorghum-based food 
industry as an alternative food can support food security.

Abstract 
This article describes the application of Game based Evaluation and Learning in the classroom for formative 
assessment. The author caters large class of 194 second year students in Applied Thermodynamics course 
and evidence showed that this game enhances students’ attendance and learning in the course. The students 
got motivated to learn the course as it is active learning which much better as compared to the regular rote 
learning.  The amalgamation of gamification as part of evaluation tasks is a complex process in active 
learning.  It takes into attention not only the surrounding or motivational aspects of the activity, but also the 
quality criteria that are compulsory from the evaluation perspective. In the course, the Stock Market game 
was designed and customized for the active learning and evaluation in a structured fashion. In order to 
assess the effectiveness of it a survey was conducted. This activity received accolade from the students.

1. INTRODUCTION
Relate to traditional teaching, the teacher has to create original ideas in 21st century to face some important 
problems around student motivation and engagement. To cater large classes and low rates of student retention is a 
serious problem in higher education. Large classes are less effective as compared to small classes for achieving 
knowledge retention with changing student attitudes due to influx of technological development.  
Play is a kind of voluntary, motivated activity and is associated with recreational pleasure and enjoyment 
(Garvey, 1990). It is required to fulfil basic desire for relaxation and entertainment and this technique is used for 
formative evaluation purposes. It is used in various contexts for numerous purposes and at almost all levels of 
education (Becker, 2007). Games are an outer expression of play. It involves sets of rules, activities in order to achieve 
a crucial purpose, namely fun. Gamification increases user's motivation and engagement. In higher education, games 
have been found to be beneficial for academic achievement, motivation and classroom dynamics (Sharples, 2000). 
Motivation is demonstrated by an individual’s choice to engage in an activity and the intensity of effort or persistence 
in that activity (Garris et al., 2002 ). The author presents a game based method in gamification. It is well-defined as 
“the use of design (rather than game-based technology or other game-related practices) elements (rather than fully 
developed games) characteristic for games (rather than play or playfulness) in non-game contexts (regardless of 
specific usage intentions, contexts, or implementation media)” (Deterding, Dixon, et al., 2011). There is strong 
evidence that shows the relationship between game playing and increased motivation. During game based learning, 
students are so engaged and motivated that they are learning even they are not aware of it (Burguillo, 2010). Therefore, 
games can be made an integrated part of a traditional classroom lecture to improve learning, motivation and 
engagement (Wang, 2007; Owston, 2009). Retention levels of the students can be enhanced when active learning 
methods are used (McKeachie, 1999; Silberman, 1996). 
The evidence supports that there is a positive correlation between class attendance and academic performance 
within college classes across disciplines. (Nancy Fjortoft, 2005). But in the present era, the students are physically 
present but are mentally absent in the class room. This is the major issue teachers are grappling with in higher 
education system. This is owing to the technological development as information is available on finger tip of the 
students on their cell phones through internet. So merely enforcing the attendance on the students is not necessarily

Fig.3 Feedback Survey 
 
The feedback survey indicates that the majority of students agreed that the GABEL is a very effective way 
for learning. Apart from fun it has increased their interest and motivated them to learn the course. It has improved 
their learning. Most important point was more than 80% students agreed that it has helped them in quick learning 
without fear of exam and helped them in collaborative learning. Also same percentage of students agreed that this has 
helped them to engage more with the course and encouraged them to attend classes. They also agreed that it is a useful 
and effective tool for teaching and should be replicated in other courses. The overall the feedback shows that GABEL 
is a very effective tool for evaluation as well as learning. Though some students have not agreed to the statements, 
which may be due to the reason that they have not gone through the content shared with them or could not have 
completed the activity timely. 
  
Conclusion 
The biggest problem that teachers face in Engineering education is keeping students interested and motivated 
in their studies. For this 21st century generation traditional teaching method is not sufficient to keep them engaged and 
motivated to learn course. So GABEL is an effective tool to make students interested in attending the class and also 
stimulate them to learn.  
Exam fear is one of the biggest cause of depression amongst the students, with GABEL being tension free 
and stress busting evaluation and learning system, it has helped students to reduce their exam related anxiety and 
simultaneously helped them to improve their learning. Also it has facilitated them in quick learning which is much 
better than rote learning. So, GABEL is one of the strong tool for active and quick learning amongst the students.

Abstract 
The main problem is how strategies improve the quality of education in higher education: 1) 
understanding of the reality of the program, the quality of the program and the factors that influence it. In 
improving the quality of education, there must be sustainability of performance (functioning as a measure to 
address the problems of low quality education that relies on conventional approaches) and improving quality 
(directing higher education institutions to learn and implement Total Quality Management) that is integrated 
with each quality management level of management and all units in the organizational system that aim to 
provide satisfactory services to customers, so they must optimize management to improve quality. The approach 
used is qualitative: (1) students are satisfied with services; (2) the service to its students; (3) to have high quality 
and meet the expectation; (4) the services of higher education: division of labor, relationships and 
communication between leaders, employees, salary / honor received and service. One of flourish base 
qualification is Integrated Qualify Management (IQM) and needs the character change of the one who is the 
leader and the one who does work; the command from the leader changed by the worker into the initiative. The 
result can be concluded as follows 1) the understanding of stakeholders in the reality of study programs and 
factors influencing; 2) the quality of education process relatively customer satisfaction fulfillment

a2 of 0.427 for variable X2 (lecturer performance), and constant a of 31,913. The form between the independent variables 
and the dependent variable can be described by the regression equation Ŷ = 31,913 + 0.316X1 + 0.427X2. The strength of 
multivariate correlation between variables X1, X2 and Y variables obtained by the correlation coefficient R = 0.534. The 
coefficient of determination between variables (X1, X2) and the dependent variable (Y) is equal to R2 = (0.534) 2 = 0.285 
indicating that 28.5% of the variations that occur in the education quality variable can be explained together by leadership 
variables and lecturer performance together through the regression equation Ŷ = 31,913 + 0.316X1 + 0.427X2. The 
remaining variance is explained by other variables. 
 
4. Conclusion and Recomendation 
From the descriptive study in general it can be concluded that the level of education quality, leadership and quality 
of education are in good condition, this becomes the basis for efforts to plan and assess the quality or quality of education 
at PT. Improving the quality of education will be carried out well with the planning and evaluation of various management 
activities that have been carried out in a certain period of time, both in the management of higher education management 
and the learning process and management of human resources. The quality of human resources, especially lecturers as 
leaders in the learning process activities is needed as a basis for efforts to improve and improve the learning process, the 
quality and quality of an educator will be seen in the achievement of the management of learning activities and student 
achievement PT. 
PT leadership has an important role in the management of quality universities, leaders in carrying out leadership 
that is not good and unprofessional, will give a bad influence on the achievement of quality education in higher education, 
this is due to all policies in managing PT management lies with the leadership, so that the existence of good leadership 
will be the foundation in achieving the quality of education itself, in an effort to achieve that a leader needs the ability and 
quality in managing, guiding, fostering and directing every element of the PT in achieving educational goals. 
Based on the results of the research and conclusions as stated above, the following suggestions are conveyed; 
Leaders in the management of PT resources need appropriate leadership tailored to the needs and circumstances that exist 
within the scope of the PT by evaluating and appropriately evaluating various activities that have been carried out, a leader 
being in an educational institution especially PT, so that the right leadership can provide motivation and strong indication 
of the management and implementation of quality learning activities at PT, for that the leader must improve self-quality 
and improve leadership professionalism, and understand and have the ability to carry out leadership in efforts to achieve 
educational goals, be more sensitive and care for every problem and activities that take place, with the hope of directly 
addressing any shifts or disputes that arise, in order to maintain the process of improving the quality of education of PT. 
Higher Education is a system, namely a structure consisting of various components that are closely related to each other 
functionally, so that it is synergistic integration. In these components there are processes that are in accordance with their 
respective functions, but not exclusively or individually, but are interrelated, mutually supportive, and influence each other 
(Tampubolon, 2001: 79). The right quality management system needs to be developed. Ministry of National Education 
(2003) explains Higher Education in higher education is declared quality or quality, if: 1. The university is able to establish 
and realize its vision through the implementation of its mission (deductive aspect); 2. The college is able to meet the needs 
of stakeholders (inductive aspects), in the form of: (a). Community needs (societal needs); (b) The needs of the workforce 
(industrial needs); Professional needs. Thus universities must be able to plan, run and control a process that guarantees the 
achievement of quality as described above

Abstract 
For aviation industry and facilities, safety is the most sensitive issue to consider at each processes. This is 
because a minor mistake can result huge problems and can significantly affect industry and corresponding 
facilities. In this paper, a DMAIC approach to improve on safety performance using Safety Management 
System (SMS) is illustrated at the Kuwait International Airport (KIA). The paper shows an implementation 
of such a system reduces the rate of accidents along with their costs, increases the productivity of the place, 
and meets the legal specifications needed to insure safety at airports. Several hazards with the suggested 
preventions to control these hazards were illustrated. The DMAIC methodology is used to describe the 
hazards and how they should be improved and controlled. A Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) technique is applied 
to investigate the hazards. At the end, SMS was proved to be an effective system to apply at KIA.

1. Introduction
Air transportation is expected to nearly double in the next two decades and the forecasted traffic is also expected to 
double by then (ICAO 2013). This traffic will result in over two commercial air transport accidents per week if the 
same accident rate of 2016 prevails in 2030 (ICAO 2017). This strongly suggests that growth in air traffic requires a 
parallel effort in aviation safety to reduce accident rates (Batuwangala et al. 2018). Occupational safety and health 
issue is a serious action that is considered by many countries and is taken into account (Abrey and Smallwood 2014). 
Kuwait is one of the countries that consider the occupational safety and health issues as one of the fundamental issues 
that needs to be upgraded, improved, and developed every now and then. In this paper, we chose Kuwait international 
airport (KIA) as a real case facility related to occupational safety and health issues. The most common types of hazard 
problems at KIA are musculoskeletal disorders, temperature extremes, noise, and being affected due to chemical 
materials. Therefore, proper occupational safety and health assessments, preventions, controls, and methodologies are 
necessary to be followed in order to avoid these hazards (Müller et al. 2014). Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) and the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health (NYCOSH) focused on 
the dangers associated with airline and airport environment. They emphasized the need of private contractors operating 
at airports to enhance the safety and efficiency of airports. Unsafe hazardous working conditions may put workers, 
airport visitors, and passengers at huge risk of injuries or death. Contractors and airport management play an important 
role in reducing and preventing these risks. This is done by committing and applying OSHA’s and NYCOSH’s 
recommendations such as conducting workplace hazard assessments, providing health and safety training, providing 
personal protective equipment (PPE), and notifying employees of any hazardous substances and chemicals (Newman 
et al. 2015). Many tools, techniques, and approaches such as Failure Tree Analysis (FTA), risk analysis, and safety 
management system (SMS) helped occupational safety and health managers to make further judgment of hazards 
(Baig et al. 2013). SMS is an approach that is applied in (KIA) to manage safety risks that are associated with 
operational organization and activities performed by employees. One reason behind SMS implementation in KIA is 
that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has mandated SMS to be implemented in all sides of all

5. Conclusion 
To sum up, in this paper a real life problems from KIA were studied by using DMAIC methods and materials related 
to occupational safety and health. Many work places often suffer from lack of safety requirements which would cause 
hazards and would sometimes lead to series health problems or even death (Charles 2003). KIA is one of the important 
facilities in Kuwait where not only local people work in it but it is also visited by global people from all around the 
world. Therefore, KIA needs to insure a safer environment which guarantees a better working place. This paper 
showed different hazard types that may happen at KIA. It also described the main causes of these hazards. At the end, 
a methodology was constructed to show the steps of finding the problems and how they were eliminated and 
controlled. A fault tree analysis technique was applied. The results showed that SMS application guaranteed a better 
and safer environment to work at.

Abstract 
Currently, most of the companies manage inventory in a traditional supply chain approach. But due to the 
company’s policies in return services and remanufacturing processes, a traditional supply chain is not really 
effective. The importance on working on inventory control is because of the difficulty of having a stable inventory 
control due to bullwhip effect which reduces the performance of supply chain. There is now Close Loop Supply 
Chain (CLSC) use for the benefit of companies as it is very effective in reverse logistic flow. This effects the 
collection and distribution planning, inventory control, and production planning which reduces the effect in 
returnability which will increase the performance of the company. This project focuses on inventory control. This 
work successfully develops System Dynamic (SD) model of the system for returns, using close loop diagrams, to 
have effective management of inventory control and remanufacturing and/or production planning. Fuzzy Logic is 
used in the model analysis to optimize inventory control and reduce the bullwhip effect in the real-world. This fuzzy 
decision makes the system less uncertain and creates lower bullwhip effect.

4. Results  
 
SD simulation model for the closed loop supply chain is made for inventory of remanufacturing and production. The 
objective of the simulation was to see the model relationship between factors that affects the system for return 
process. The main factors were residence time and return index where return index was due to service agreement 
with customers and customer behavior. 
 
The SD modeling process has step by step to complete, where firstly it started with the making of CLD which 
was qualitative modeling and description of main feedback loops. Then the model involved quantitative approach 
with SFD that included numerical formulas. The model was then tested for validation for extreme condition test and 
behavior test including homogeneity of the units. After validation, simulation analysis was done using different 
parameters to see the return process like residence time, service agreement with customers and their behavior. 
 
The inventory cost in a manufacturing company is high therefore there is a need to have the cost least enough 
to give best customer service. This shows the performance of the company in terms of inventory handling and 
therefore with the help of the model, further steps are taken by using fuzzy controller to optimize the inventory and 
in addition reducing the bullwhip effects. 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In the production and remanufacturing and its inventory there are some important factors a manager must identify. 
This paper has used some important factors that cause impacts in the inventory, thus cause production and 
remanufacturing changes. With the help of the SD model, the study was able to not only recognize the control 
strategies in the system of remanufacturing, but also improve the whole system related to returns and within closed 
loop supply chain. The model is mainly based on electronic consumer industries where the variables and factors are 
quite similar in returns, including the inventories for remanufacturing and production run.  Therefore, the model 
could work on many electronic consumer-based companies where managers could understand the impact of the 
variables and therefore could compare the models, and simulate them with real world. However, this model is also 
usable for other manufacturing industries that are not related to electronic, but changes could be done on their 
variables and relationships. This SD Model could be added for further research where it can be integrated with other 
factors such as capacity and facilities planning, information sharing, supply chain management, etc. These additional 
combined models will give bigger scope for bigger closed loop supply chain. However, other endogenous, 
exogenous and excluded variables should be included where different assumptions could be used.

Abstract 
In this study kitchen bio waste and sewage sludge were co-digested anaerobically to produce biogas with 
the aid of Hycura, engineering granules to enhance bio methane production. Co-digestion was conducted 
for mesophilic temperatures of 37 °C in a 20 L bio digester for a period of 30 days. Kitchen and sewage 
sludge were inoculated in the ratio 50:50. Hycura was inoculated to enhance biogas production at a 
loading of 0.05 g/L. The co-digestion resulted in significant degrease of the total volatile solids and 
chemical oxygen demand of the bio waste by >75%. Mesophilic conditions favored high quality bio 
methane production with methane content as high as 74%. Inoculation with Hycura hindered H2S 
production which enhanced the quality of the biogas and makes it easier for upgrading.

1.Introduction
Huge amounts of biodegradable kitchen bio waste are being generated daily from the catering industry and at the same time 
municipal sewage plants are having challenges managing bio waste mainly sewage sludge. These bio wastes find 
themselves to the landfills limiting the life span of landfills. Sewage sludge and kitchen waste being highly organic 
material have both the have potential to be converted to biogas through anaerobic digestion (Muzenda, 2014). Kitchen 
waste has high calorific values compared to municipal waste hence presents an opportunity for biogas with high methane 
content (Gray et al., 2008; Apte et al., 2013).  
Biogas is a good source of renewable energy that can be used for heating and cooking purposes and in some instances 
upgraded to electricity production (Neves et al., 2005; Prabhu and Mutnuri, 2009). Biogas production from the co-digestion 
of kitchen waste and sewage has become topical due to the increased digestion based on the number of microorganisms in 
the bio waste (Neves et al., 2005; Malik and Bharti, 2009). Production of biogas from bio waste is an attractive waste 
management initiative that promotes sustainability through the production of a renewable and green source of energy which

Hycura’s bio catalysis effect (Manyuchi et al., 2015). It was also assumed that the interactive effect by the microorganisms 
from the bio waste enhanced the anaerobic digestion process In addition, the biogas had low values of H2S and this was 
attributed to the hindering effect of Hycura in producing H2S. The composition of the biogas is given in Table 2.

4.Conclusion 
High methane content biogas can be obtained from the digestion of kitchen and sewage sludge bio waste to achieve 
methane composition as high as 74%. Co-digestion of sewage sludge with kitchen bio waste enhances biogas production 
and promotes waste management especially with the addition of Hycura as a co-digestion catalyst enhances the bio 
methane composition in the biogas and reduces the amount of contaminants. Biogas production from kitchen and sewage 
sludge bio waste promotes sustainable development at the same time mitigating climate change.

Abstract 
Build to Order or Make to Order is a common approach for highly configured products such as special vehicles 
(vehicles that are adapted and altered to suit a specific purpose). Examples of such vehicles are special ambulances as 
well as vehicles adapted for the support and transport of passengers with less mobility. In this type of business, 
operations are scheduled in response to a confirmed order received from a final customer. Thus, the variability and 
the uncertainty characterizing what is project based, generate a complexity that requires specifically tailored 
managerial approaches to handle all the involved processes - from design and engineering to production and delivery. 
Hence, in this accentuated complexity, it is extremely important to guarantee that both the material and information 
flows are efficient and effective. The present study, framed in a program of operational improvement in a manufacturer 
of special vehicles, aims to address some concrete improvement opportunities related to the significant number of raw 
materials stockouts and to the high number of changes made by the client after production has started. In fact, during 
the manufacturing and assembly process, there are constant changes that delay and difficult planning and consequently 
decreases the overall efficiency and effectiveness. Strategies to address all these matters are to be identified and 
applied.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, manufacturing companies compete on multiple performance objectives, namely concerning quality, 
flexibility and responsiveness. At the same time, operational efficiency remains of capital importance in order to 
reduce non-added value activities and consequently diminish the operating costs. Furthermore, companies are more 
customer centric, that is, they are trying to adopt more and more a demand-driven manufacturing approach, in which 
the products are planned and built against customers confirmed orders. Thus, the ability to fulfil these orders at the 
required time and with an effective cost determines the competitive advantage in today’s low volume and high variety 
competitive business environment. To meet this challenge, mass customization and personalization are key strategies 
that companies are exploring. 
In that context, companies are changing product development strategies and manufacturing processes in order to 
efficiently implement adequate operating models, such as build-to-order (BTO), make-to-order (MTO) and assembly-
to-order (ATO) to react to the growing individualization of demand. In fact, customized manufacturing is an ongoing 
trend in many production sectors (Simão, Stadzisz and Morel, 2006). In a MTO environment, the production and 
assembly of products are usually driven by customer requirements (Yang and Fung, 2014). Thus, the ability to fulfil 
customer orders at the required time and with effective cost determines the competitive advantage in today’s dynamic 
market. This type of environment grants the client the possibility to choose from a range of choices in order to meet 
his needs in the most desirable way. In this so-called make-to-order environment, the variety and complexity of the 
supply chain rises several challenges concerning production planning, sourcing and efficiency, among others.

In order to weekly measure this index, it was created an Excel file where, for each change, it has to be filled in the 
serial number of the vehicle, the date of the end of production, the date it started production and the date of the change, 
the responsible for the communication of the change (commercial or technical departments), the name of the person 
responsible, the detail of the alteration and the affected areas (up to six). 
Between the period of May 7th and June 24th, the number of changes per department were registered, as can be 
observed in Figure 7. 60% of changes have its origin in the Technical Department and 20% of changes have its origin 
in the Commercial Department.  
 
 
 
Figure 7. Number of changes per department 
 
The goal is to standardize the main Transformation types (B, A2 and A1-FR) with quantification and referencing of 
materials and vehicles pre-assembled components like stretchers. 
A configurator was created using Microsoft Excel for each standard Ambulance Type (B, A2 and A1-FR). For that 
reason, it is possible to automate and standardize Budgeting, the Descriptive Memory to be sent to the client and the 
Bill of Materials to be sent to the Technical Department and Purchasing Department. 
Furthermore, some internal deadlines for modifications after the contract agreement were defined: 
• The process must reach the Technical Department until the seventh day of the month prior to the month it enters 
Production; 
•The process will have to enter the Production Department until the fifteenth day of the month before the month it 
enters Production – with no opportunity for modifications, unless there is availability.  
With the creation of the configurator, references with quantities are automatic and generated at the same time of the 
commercial proposal. Thus, a mockup was done and it was observed that it would take a total of 45 minutes to perform 
the following tasks: 
• 
00h30 - Budgeting + Descriptive Memory + Bill of Materials) 
• 
00h15 - Verifying BOM and sending files to the technical department + purchasing department 
It is therefore possible to calculate the following benefits: 
• 
Number of work predicted for 2018: 880 
• 
Hours saved/ year: (195 min – 45 min) x 880: 132.000 min./year = 2.200 hours/year 
• 
There are in average 222 working days per year. Considering that a person works eight years per day, in one 
year that person will work 1776 hours. 
Therefore, one person is not necessary anymore and can be given other functions. 
Furthermore, the weekly percentage of changes diminished, reaching a value of 3%, which can be seen in Figure 8.

The results obtained throughout the project envisage the company improving as far as raw materials management is 
concerned, being presented a new purchasing model capable of reducing stock levels without compromising 
production needs. 
In the AS-IS situation, there were 43% of stockouts and 32% of changes in production. When writing this document, 
the indicators were 15% and 3%, respectively. Thus, comparatively to the starting values, it was possible to reduce 
the level of stockouts in 28%. Furthermore, it was possible to reduce the number of changes in 29%, improving one 
of the factors that was most contributing to the difficulties in production planning. Due to a time restriction to carry 
out this project, it was not possible to achieve the target proposed of 0% of stockouts, but it was possible to reach the 
target of 5% for the percentage of changes. 
There were some adversities in the project development. The lack of initial data necessary to establish a baseline 
required that a great amount of time was spent gathering data rather than developing the tools. Furthermore, the project 
implementation suffered from the effect of resistance to change. Implementing a continuous improvement culture is 
not easy most of the times, since people do not recognize the benefits of it from the beginning. 
Although the positive results achieved, that had a great impact in the performance of the company, there are still some 
aspects to develop. For instance, regarding raw materials management, the purchasing team shall continue validating 
and making some adjustments to the quantities being ordered. 
Furthermore, a new configurator, more user-friendly, shall be developed by the IT department of the company, since 
the one developed in this context was significantly slow when processing. Moreover, a more exhaustive data collection 
regarding bills of materials will have to be done, as well as corrections and updates to the existing ones.  
On the whole, each research question defined for this project was answered. For that reason, in the future it will be 
possible to tackle other projects in the company, as there were many improvement opportunities that were recognized 
but not approached within the scope of this project. 
One research question that was not considered, but would be interesting to approach in the future, would be the 
following: 
1. What are the principles and standards that must be defined in order to ensure a correct production planning? 
It would be interesting to review the existent paradigm of “vehicles per month”. Instead of having a month planning, 
a number of processes per week to enter the Technical Department should be defined.  
Another relevant theme would be to evaluate the current production model (per section) and perform a line design in 
order to improve the production flow. 
The path towards operational excellence will depend not only on the improvement opportunities already referred but 
also on the technological infrastructure structures, namely information systems. In particular, this dimension will be 
relevant to guarantee the effectiveness and responsiveness requested in a quite challenging mass customization 
environment. 
Finally, people dimension is a key stone to guarantee the overall success of an improvement program as described. 
Therefore, it will be particular important to design, launch and deploy suitable operators-oriented programs grounded 
on quality and improvement concepts.

Abstract 
Engineered landfills are becoming popular as waste management areas in developing countries and therefore it is 
import to recover value from landfills so that the cost of operation is reduced. In this study, the potential to harness 
methane from landfill waste was investigated. Landfill waste with organic waste composition ranging from 70-90% 
was investigated for varying moisture content between 15-60%, mesophilic temperatures of 30-40°, thermophilic 
temperatures of between 50-60 °C. Anaerobic digestion was conducted in 1L digesters over a digestion period of 
70 days. Landfill waste from various cells with different ages from 5-10 years was used. Highest methane 
composition of around 70% was obtained under mesophilic conditions, for moisture content of 30-40% and aging 
waste which was compacted for more than 5 years.

Figure 4. Effect of waste age on methane composition 
The landfill site presents an opportunity for biogas production, in engineered landfills; it is recommended that pipes be 
perforated into the wells so that the biogas can be harnessed. 
4. Conclusion 
Landfills waste provides a raw material for methane generation. Methane composition of 50-70% is realized from landfill 
waste that is highly organic. Mesophilic conditions are ideal for methane generation and the highest concentration is obtained 
when the age of the waste is more than 5 years.

Abstract 
Engineered landfills are being proposed for proper waste management in developing countries as well as bio 
energy generation and recovery from the organic waste. Organic waste is a major emitter of greenhouse gases if left 
to rot, however proper operation of a landfill will see the realization of products like biogas, bio ethanol and bio 
pellets. In most developing countries, the landfills did not have the waste to energy recovery facility and must be 
constructed accordingly. However, there is need to minimize the environmental damage during the construction, 
operation and closure phases of the landfill. The construction of an engineered landfill has potential to create jobs 
and also boost the usage of green renewable energy. However there are negative impacts on the air, soil, water and 
personnel that must be minimized to allow the harnessing. of bio energy from landfills without harming the 
environment.

8. Impacts on health 
During the landfill construction and waste handling as well as during the covering of the cells dust particles are emitted 
resulting in air pollution (Yang et al., 2014). The dust particles have potential negative health effects on the personnel working 
on the landfill must always have protective clothing.  Dust emissions have potential to cause respiratory diseases which are 
harmful to the personnel. It is recommended that the soil be sprayed before being used for compaction to minimize dust 
emissions.  
9. Impacts on heritage resources 
The construction of landfills can result in the disturbance of heritage sites like cemeteries. There is need to therefore consult 
the relevant authorities and update them on the potential development.  
10. Conclusion 
Engineered landfills are a hub for renewable energy sources like biogas, bio ethanol and briquettes. For value to be able to be 
achieved from the landfills they need to be designed and constructed and designed with energy recovery in mind. The 
construction and operation of a landfill has both negative and positive effects on the environment. Negative effects such as air 
and land pollution, soil degradation as well as water contamination must be minimized to ensure little damage is done to the 
environment. Whilst positive impacts like employment creation, production and renewable energy as well as infrastructure 
development must be maximized.

Abstract 
For acquiring three dimensional shape information of objects, fringe projection profilometry is one of the 
most commonly used noncontact methods. One of the benefit of digital fringe projection profilometry is 
that utilizes a digital video projector as a structured light source, brings flexibility. However, the gamma 
nonlinearity of the video projector affects the accuracy of three dimensional topography measurements. In 
this paper, we present an accurate gamma correction technique based on a Fourier spectrum analysis. The 
presented method is validated by a simulations and experiments.

Abstract 
Sustainability issues and environmental pollution influenced organizations to reduce their environmental burden and 
more focus on sustainable production, therefore, sustainability is becoming hot debating topic for industries and its 
stakeholders. Previous studies revealed that Integrated Quality Environment Management (IQEM) provides cost 
savings, avoid duplication of tasks, improves corporate image and performance, and provide higher customer 
satisfaction. Food processing industry is growing fast, as the demand for processed foods is increasing from lifestyle 
and health conscious customers. Besides the advantages of processed food, this industry consumes abundant 
resources of water, energy, raw material, and considered as one of the sources which pollutes the environment 
through solid waste and waste water. Based on the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM), this 
study aims to test the impact of the model on the operational and environmental performance of food processing 
SMEs in Pakistan. A structured questionnaire was employed for data collection from the respondents selected using 
snowball sampling technique. IBM SPSS version-23 and Smart- PLS 3 were used for data analysis.  It is believed 
that, this study will help food manufacturers of Pakistan in improving their operational and environmental 
performance by practicing the elements of EFQM model.

1. Introduction 
Inefficient production practices posturing negative impact on environment, and being cause of resource 
depletion. The industrial sector is considered as one of the major sources, that pollutes the environment through 
solid waste, water wastages, air pollution and noise pollution. Therefore, researchers and practitioners are more 
focusing on this sector, to make it more sustainable (Alayón et al. 2017). Previous studies revealed that, sustainable 
manufacturing practices such as recycling, remanufacturing, and environmental design have an impact on company 
performance and helps towards organizational sustainability.   
Moreover, to fulfill the social, environmental and financial responsibilities, triple bottom line concepts people, 
planet and profit were introduced.  Manufacturers need to be more aware about these concepts and get maximum 
benefits. In addition, quality and environmental management systems were acknowledged as important tools to 
achieve the sustainable production principles into practice. Quality management focuses on process improvement, 
reduction of wastages and continuous improvement, whereas environmental management more focuses in reduction 
of pollution, air emissions and solid and hazardous waste (Alayón et al. 2017).

4. Conclusion and Discussion 
The results of the study have shown that IQEM model elements leadership (LS), employee management (EM), 
strategic planning (SP), process management (PM) and supplier management (SM), have a positive and strong 
relationship with operational performance (β = 0.784; t-value= 24.54; p-values=0.000), and environmental 
performance (β = 0.76; t-value= 19.54; p-values=0.000). Thus, H1 and H2 are supported. These results are consistent 
with previous studies such as Imran et al. (2018) in manufacturing SMEs, Shafiq et al. (2017) in textile industry, and 
Abeykoon and Alwis (2015) export performance. Moreover, TQM has the ability to maintain all business functions 
according to target customers, which is the key to achieve sustainable competitive advantage (El Shenawy et al. 
2007). This study has further confirmed and validated the research conclusion of statistically significant relationship 
between IQEM, and operational and environmental performance of food processing SMEs in Pakistan. In general, 
the result provides further support for the assertion of the RBV, and theory confirming the positive influence. Hence, 
leadership, employee management, strategic planning, process management and supplier management found to be 
the critical factors, and had an impact on firm’s overall performance. By practicing these factors food players can 
get a competitive advantage and improve their SMEs operational and environmental performance and expand their 
trade with rest of the world and get maximum benefits.

Abstract 
Construction employees all over the world, are faced with series of dangers within a depth greater than 1.5 metres in 
an excavation work, due to the extent of collapse. The study assessed contractors’ perception associated with hazards 
with excavation work. Forty-seven contractors within Central Region were involved in the face-to-face administration 
questionnaire. Findings from the study reveal that excavation depth, nature of the strata, presence of water, exposure 
to wet weather, any load close to the edge of the zoned of influence and the presence of chemical gases within the 
excavation area have major impact on excavation works. Excavation depth and nature of the strata were ranked as the 
highest among the thirteen hazardous variables within construction work area and the least was the time under which 
the excavation works will be carried out. Planning for hazard prevention should be in accordance with the OSHA 
guidelines. The identified hazards should be carefully analyzed for prompt measures to be taken.  
Keywords: Construction, depth of excavation, influence of water, risk, weather condition.

Abstract 
 
The constant changing working environment within the construction industry has contributed to its health 
and safety nightmare. Excavations and trenches collapse have also contributed to major injuries on 
employees and leading to their unfortunate death. Experts’ views were used, during a Delphi survey to 
assess hazards during excavation work. The experts were made up of a health and safety personnel, a 
quantity surveyor, a structural engineer, a construction manager, a project manager, a building technologist 
and an architect n Cape Coast Metropolis. Findings from the study show that the extent of excavation depth 
and nature of the strata (soil variations creating the potential for the sides to collapse) were ranked first and 
second with a mean of 9.25 and 9.00. These two variables were considered by experts to have a very high 
impact (VHI: 9-10) on the influence of excavation hazard and impact of contractors’ perception. Further 
findings show that very few employees observed the construction regulations, while almost all the 
employees obeyed the OHSA requirements. Attention should be given to proper planning and immediate 
action towards excavation hazards.

1. Introduction  
The construction industry`s safety record is unenviable, since the incidence rate of fatal accidents is higher than any 
other industry in most countries. Moreover, with the recognition of the significance to prevent accidents at an early 
stage, some major efforts have been made on the prediction of accidents in construction. However, existing precision 
of prediction on safety risks is inadequate and far from satisfactory (Wu, 2010). Employees on construction sites are 
faced with different types of fatalities when they are working at depth more than1.5m, due to the risky nature of the 
activities (Phoya, 2012). A lot of construction activities will require excavations to be undertaken before works, such 
as preparations for the foundations for erection of a new building. A report from Safe Work Australia (2014) indicated 
that an excavation site can be hazardous to all employees in the vicinity of the construction work. Report from 
International Labour Organisation (ILO, 2009) shows that hazard from workplace could impair the health and well-
being of workers. Any particular hazard identified in relation to excavation work as indicated in a Safe Work Australia 
(2014) report shows that there should be a proper handling of any hazard identified to minimize or prevent accidents 
on site. Opaleye, O., Smallwood, J. and Shakantu, W.  (2015 in their study of Accident on Small Scale Construction 
Sites in Pretoria, concluded that conclusion that hazards on construction sites include:  poor supervision of the workers 
and unsafe behavior of workers on site, misappropriate use personal protective equipment (PPE), and employees not 
heeding to instructions during erection of scaffolds and inappropriate use of ladder. The paper assessed contractors’ 
perception towards hazards in excavation works.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
 
The study assessed how contractors’ perception will influence hazards occurrence in excavation. The extent of 
excavation depth in predicting the occurrence of accidents has the highest standard deviation of 1.053. Indicating the 
need to put appropriate measures during the exercise to minimise any unforeseen. All the thirteen variables of 
excavation hazards have a mean ranging from 4.04 – 4.47 which shows that all the variables are considered to be very 
necessary during excavation works.  The standard deviation of all the variables ranging from 0.755 – 1.053 also show 
how strong the variables when it comes to excavation works. Contractors should take all the listed variables serious 
and considered them during any excavation works, in order to minimise major injuries and any unforeseen deaths on 
sites.

1. Introduction  
Excavation and trenching are among the most hazardous construction operations in the construction sector 
(Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2005). The construction sector in Ghana is dynamic and a contributor 
to the economy of the country. The sector involves several stakeholders and has wide range of linkages with other 
areas of activities which may contribute to accident on sites (Construct Ghana, 2018).  Construction workers engage 
in many activities that may expose them to serious hazards, such as falling from rooftops, unguarded machinery, being 
struck by heavy construction equipment, electrocutions, silica dust, and asbestos (United States Department of Labour, 
n.d.). Accidents happen on sites more often because they are unfortunate incidents that occur unexpectedly and 
unintentionally, typically resulting in damage or injury (Merriam-Webster, 2018).  Accident “can be read by some as 
a term exonerating the person responsible.” Serious injuries and fatalities result from collapsing trenches and

5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The study assessed excavation hazard and presents possible preventive measures based on contractors’ perception. 
Two variables were ranked to have more influence on excavation hazard based on the mean, but three variables were 
found to have very high impact (VHI). Two of such variables (the extent of excavation depth and nature of the strata 
happened to have both influence and impact on excavation hazard. This indicates how dangerous these variables pose 
to employees during excavation. Emphasis should be placed on these variables and any other variable found to pose 
serious danger to employees. It was observed that few of the construction regulations were observed by employees. 
While most of the OHSA requirements were obeyed by employees. All hazards identified should be carefully analyzed 
and appropriate measures put in place to minimize or prevent serious accident on site. Planning for excavation hazard 
should be well executed and prompt action taken when due.  Further studies should be conducted using a different 
method to ascertain the extent of accident and cost incurred in relation to excavation hazard on employees.

Abstract 
 
Two main topics related to continuous improvement projects (CIPs) in hospitals are addressing in this 
paper: critical success factors (CSF) and CIP outcomes. First, CSFs for CIPs are those factors highly 
related to CIP success.  A previous investigation in this topic suggested the presence of 53 factors related 
to CIP success in hospitals.  Second, CIP success could be measured with CIP hard outcomes (e.g. 
percentage of goal achievement and percentage of target area performance improvement) and CIP soft 
outcomes (e.g. CIP target area perceives impact). Recently, eleven survey items were used to measure 
CIP target area perceives impact (CIP soft outcome).  The purpose of this paper is to create a conceptual 
framework to assess the relationship between 53 factors related to CIP success in hospitals (independent 
variable) and two CIP outcomes (dependent variables: two soft outcomes). In order to address this aim, 
the research team collected 112 valid surveys responses from CIP leaders in hospitals and conducted 
seven exploratory factors analysis.  The final conceptual framework was constructed using the input-
process-output approach and consisted of 13 independent construct variables and two dependent construct 
variables.

Abstract  
This study aims to determine the effect of the ethical leaderships toward organizational culture at 
Himpunan Mahasiswa (Student Organization) of Business Administration on Faculty of Communication 
and Business at Telkom University or known as ‘HIMA ADBIS’. This research uses quantitative method 
with the types of data required are the combination between primary and secondary data. This research 
uses saturation sampling method with 52 respondents consisting of all organizers of HIMA ADBIS, and 
simple linear regression analysis for data analyzing. The results showed that ethical leadership is in the 
position of 84,08% with a number of very high category and organizational culture in the position of 
86,27% with a number of very high category. The result of partially showed that ethical leadership 
influence organizational culture amounted to 22,5% and from other variables amounted 77,5% are not

the results of descriptive analysis, it shows that HIMA ADBIS has a leader with ethics that is in 
accordance with the characteristics of innovation and the courage to take risks, attention to detail, 
outcome orientation, people orientation, team orientation, aggressiveness and stability based on 
Robbins's opinion in Didit (2013: 148). Obtained statement of the organization gives awards to 
the organizers with 91.92% points or are at 239 points is the highest point of the questionnaire 
results.

Conclusion 
 
Based on the results of the research which has been described about the effect of Ethical 
Leadership toward organizational culture of HIMA ADBIS, the conclusion can be obtained as 
follows: Ethical Leadership at Leader of HIMA ADBIS in the eyes of the respondent as a whole 
is in a category of very good. Organizational culture in HIMA ADBIS overall into the very good 
category. Ethical leadership Variable has an influence toward organizational culture of HIMA 
ADBIS. The magnitude of the influence of ethical leadership for the culture of the Organization 
was of 22.5% while the rest is influenced by other factors not examined in this study.  
Based on the conclusion that has been described above, the researcher can give some 
suggestion that would be useful for HIMA ADBIS that is based on the results of the research, 
self-control indicators that get the lowest score but fall into the good category is ""Leaders have 
the power to resist temptation and self-satisfaction"". It is suggested that the leader can further 
increase his sense of dissatisfaction of an achievement so that the organization and the leader 
itself can make improvement towards the better. For example, by doing fault evaluations in the 
execution of tasks and applying them to subsequent task work, listen more to critics and 
suggestions from set organizers and members of the set for improvement, and create new 
strategies to improve performance as well as expected achievement. 
It is expected that leaders can improve organizational culture in terms of the giving of the 
direction and clear communication as well as detailed in analyzing the work to organizer did not 
occur a misunderstanding to interpret the message and ambiguity in following SOP. These things 
can be overcome e.g. by means of more outlines the intent, purpose and how to complete tasks 
that must be done, explain organizer SOP in more detail, as well as frequently performing 
communication between leader and organizer intensively, mutual listening and mutual 
understanding of the circumstances in order to create a continuity so there is no longer a wrong 
perception. It is also important in creating value the culture of the Organization and reinforces 
the significance of the tagline ""kita, keluarga, jaya bersama"" (we are family, together toward 
glory) in the basic principle so that there is a solid foundation for the organization.

Abstract  
 
This study focuses on the microbial degradation of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) to vermicompost as a 
bioconversion strategy. Water hyacinth was vermicomposted using Eisenia Fetida earthworms loaded at a rate of 
150 earthworms/L over a period of 35 days. The changes in water hyacinth total organic carbon (TOC), chemical 
oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TP), and total phosphorous (TP) and total potassium (TP) were measured 
using standard methods. Linear models were generated using MATLab 13.0 to describe the changes in 
physicochemical properties with change in vermicomposting time using the regression coefficients (R2) values. The 
TOC and COD decreased significantly by 60% and 53% as the water hyacinth was converted to vermicompost. The 
TKN, TP and TK increased by 93%, 127% and 98% respectively. Linear models developed indicated R2 values of 
0.9 for all the parameters.

Abstract 
 
In today’s highly competitive world, industries are forced to find ways to survive by increasing efficiency and 
reducing costs.  As one of several industries that are facing the challenges, the printing industry is threatened by 
competitions both among companies in the industry and technological threats like multimedia, e-books, etc., leading 
to the reduction in sales prices, higher competitions, and lower demands. This accentuates the need for companies 
to cut costs and improve productivity.  The concept of Lean Manufacturing revolves around reducing wastes.  
Reduction of wastes can lead to significant increase in productivity and reduction in costs.  Thus, Lean 
manufacturing is one of the techniques that can potentially be applied to provide means for companies in the 
industry to survive.  This research studies the analysis of setup time reduction of a printing process using a lean 
concept called Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED).   Main strategy for SMED involves identifying setup 
activities, trying to convert the internal activities to external activities, and reducing activity times.  The analyses 
of setup activities are conducted and a methodology to reduce standard setup time is presented.  Although data used 
in this research pertain to the company used as a case study, the approach can be applied to a printing process in 
general.

1  Introduction 
 
Amidst the global decline of economy, companies are forced to find ways to survive by cutting costs, increasing 
efficiencies, and reducing losses among several other things.  Among several strategies, Lean Production is one that 
has been implemented to a variety of industries in order to reduce costs or so called wastes and has allowed companies 
to increase their productivity and provide surviving leverages (Resende et al. 2014). 
 
The concepts of lean emphasize elimination or removal of wastes, which have been traditionally categorized into 
seven types:- over production, transportation or unnecessary movements of materials, waiting time, processes (over 
processing or incorrect processing), inventory, motion, and defective goods (Elbert 2012).  In the perspective of lean 
production, wastes involved in production activities are typically activities that do not add value to the product.  The 
elimination of wastes leads to reduction of costs and subsequently results in more efficiency and higher profits for the 
organization.   
 
 
1.1.  Setup time reduction 
 
Setup or changeover time is one element that can have a significant impact on overall production time or cycle time.  
It has been regarded by firms as one of the most expensive costs in manufacturing (Holweg 2006).  Reducing setup 
time can lead to the reduction of cycle time as well as open up more capacity for production. This, in turn, leads to the

Assuming that average lot size is 10,000 books and the machine speed is 10,000 sheets per hour, an approximation on 
time saving per day can be obtained as shown below. 
 
Operating time per day:   
8 hours or 480 minutes 
Production time per one job:  
Setup + lot size ÷ speed   
 
Initial production time per one job = 69 + 60 = 129 minutes 
Production time per one job after improvement = 43 + 60 = 103 minutes 
 
Initially, the total time required for producing one job with lot size of 10,000 is 129 minutes.  For an eight operating-
hour day, 480 ÷ 129 = 3.72 jobs can be produced per day.  After the improvement, 480 ÷ 103 = 4.66 jobs can be 
produced by one machine daily.  This contributes to 25.27% increase in production capacity, which can be significant.   
 
 
7  Conclusion 
 
This paper has analyzed the setup of a printing process for book production and applied SMED, a technique in lean 
manufacturing, to reduce or improve the setup time.  The analysis of setup operations has led to the possibility of 
separating the activities into internal and external activities.  Further analysis has been performed to provide ways to 
reduce the setup time by changing plausible activities from internal to external and by shortening some internal activity 
time by performing one activity simultaneously with other internal activities.  This research provides solutions that 
can be implemented which results in an increase production capacity by 25.27% on average lot size provided in the 
assumption of the results section. 
 
In practice, however, the success of the implementation depends on several other managerial issues and factors, such 
as motivation, operators’ mind sets, and several other factors.  This issue has been addressed by previous research 
works including Lodgaard et al. (2016), AlManei et al. (2017), and Moeuf et al. (2016) and is not the focus of this 
research.  Further extension of this research may include a case study of real implementation, a more thorough study 
of the impact of setup time reduction on the financial performance, success factors involved in implementing the 
results, and further attempts to reduce time used in internal and external activities.

Abstract 
The same as for planning in different categorize, maintenance planning deals with probabilistic 
parameters, due to uncertainty in all cases. One of the probabilities which maintenance planning is facing 
is related to the machines and components failure. These kinds of failure are completely accidental. 
Hence, involving a reliability prediction model for these uncertain cases would magnetize predictive 
values. In this study, based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, a model for prediction of 
different systems reliability is developed. Based on the outputs of this prediction model for a case study 
(failures of electromotor in south pars gas Complex), it is demonstrated that the errors of predicted values 
are less than those for non-Fuzzy models.

Abstract 
 
With the demands of quality management and process control in the industry, machine vision is 
becoming an important tool to improve inspection quality and speed. It is predicted that the vision 
inspection techniques may replace traditional inspection methods soon. Machine vision is the 
automatic extraction of information from digital images for process or quality control. An 
automated machine vision is better suited to repetitive inspection tasks. Measurement, counting, 
location, and decoding are some of the most common applications for machine vision. The 
research project work presented here is based on the faculty led undergraduate student “hands-on” 
research sponsored by the university grant. Four different colored gear models are analyzed using 
an image processing software. A vision guided industry type robot is used to make the quality 
control decision by picking the good part from the bad parts based on image processing criteria. 
This research work enhanced the research experience for the student as well as for the faculty and 
improved the class room pedagogy for the mechanical engineering courses. The gear models, robot 
programming software, hardware setup, and vision tool software are presented in this article.  The 
vision guided robot performed the quality control function consistently.

1. Introduction 
 
According to one market research report -the Machine Vision Market is expected to grow from $8.08B in 
2015 to $12.50B by 2020. With the demands of quality management and process control in the industry, machine 
vision is becoming an important tool to improve inspection quality and speed. It is predicted that the vision inspection 
techniques may replace traditional inspection methods in the near future. Machine vision is the automatic extraction 
of information from digital images for process or quality control. An automated machine vision is better suited to 
repetitive inspection tasks. Measurement, counting, location, and decoding are some of the most common applications 
for machine vision.  Machine vision can inspect hundreds or even thousands of parts per minute and provides more 
consistent and reliable inspection results.  
 
 
Industry 4.0, or ""The Industrial Internet of Things,"" will rely upon machine vision to revolutionize industrial 
automation. One of the most hotly discussed topics in the manufacturing world today is Industry 4.0, or ""The Industrial 
Internet of Things."" Industry 4.0 refers to a set of emerging innovations in advanced automation, machine vision, Big 
Data, cloud computing and machine learning which will revolutionize manufacturing. Industry 4.0 demonstrates 
tremendous potential to bolster productivity, reduce waste, refine product quality, enhance manufacturing flexibility, 
decrease operating costs and deliver myriad other benefits to the factory floor. Industry 4.0 is associated specifically

Figure 9. VGR pick the good part from other parts. 
6. Results and Recommendation 
 
Four different coloured gear models were analysed using vision guided robot (VGR). The VGR is programmed 
to identify and fixture the good part using Pat Max vision tool. The VGR was able to pick the good part from other 
parts every time automatically. Even when the parts orientation changed, VGR was able to pick the good part.   
 
This research integrated the quality control process using the VGR technology with robot programming to accept 
the good part based on part quality control criteria. It is vital to the education of future engineering students to remain 
up-to-date with this technology. The undergraduate student gained a tremendous “hands-on” research experience 
working with the faculty.  
 
It is recommended that the robotic vision course should be developed and taught in the universities due to its 
increasing popularity and projected exponential use in the modern-day quality inspection environment.

Abstract 
In the current business environment, supply chain management plays an important role in 
business activities, manufacturing industries, and the service industries in order to increase their 
effectiveness, efficiency, customer service, and profit. Supply chain management is considered 
an important and focused management tool for optimizing organisation’s efficiency and 
accomplishing their goals. Therefore, it is crucial for industries to focus on the key factors of

Abstract 
In this paper, in order to measure the customer churn rate in the Iranian banks, a new approach is introduced. First, 
using data preparation, the data is normalized. Then, using a k-medoids method, data clustering is formed. To assess 
the clustering performance, Davies-Bouldin index is applied. To detect the patterns available in the data, different 
Neural Network (NN) methods were exploited namely, Radial Basis Function (RBFNN), Generalized Regression 
(GRNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLPNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To increase the precision in the 
model performance measurement, hybrid of first and second error type cost functions is considered. The results 
suggest that the MLPNN and SVM models show higher precision and lower cost function.

5. Conclusion  
Nowadays, Customer Relationship Management is one of the most important managerial concepts. The core 
of CRM is customer churn, and customer retention. Using data mining it is possible to recognize the hidden patterns 
of the data. The customer churn, also prediction the leaving customers pose huge amount of cost on the organization. 
In this research a new approach is presented to analyze the customer churn in Iranian bank. To form a more precise 
model, a cost function was suggested. And the results indicate the well performance of MLP compared to SVM, RBF 
and GRNN in making the customer churn prediction.

Abstract 
Construction projects are well noted for outrunning both budgeted sum and schedule, yet among various 
factors that subject TEB projects to overruns, owners related factors cannot be over emphasized. This 
study therefore set out to determine the order of influence of the owners related factors on the 
performance of selected TEB projects. The perceptions of key construction stakeholders from 4 selected 
tertiary institutions, chosen consequent upon the record indicating a huge allocation received by these 
institutions from the federal government for capital projects, in the Southwestern part of Nigeria were 
sought. Out of 120 questionnaires that were administered on the respondents, 78 valid questionnaires 
were received and subjected to analysis via mean item score and Student t-test. Reliability analysis for the 
internal consistency of the research instrument shows alpha values of 0.750 and 0.936 for projects 
procured under open and selective tendering methods respectively. Financial problems occasioned by 
delayed payments, financial difficulties and economic problems coupled with the lack of working 
knowledge on the part of client are found predisposing TEB projects to overruns. The factors cut across 
the TEB projects procured either through open or selective competitive tendering methods. Despite the 
same order of rating as evidenced in the analysis under both tendering arrangements, there are significant 
differences between the means of the factors under open and selective tendering routes. The respondents 
do not place too much blame on the owner’s related factors because not only the experience and 
reputation of the contractors are taking into consideration when being selected but also technical 
capability and financial soundness. In order to enhance speedy, smooth and efficient execution of the 
TEB projects devoid of cost and time overruns, construction client s should make adequate funds 
available for works so as to guard against financial problems emanating from delayed payments which 
could cause financial difficulties for the contractor. Client should also resolve major design issues with 
the consultants prior to the execution on site.

Device design for SAE 1020 steel tool storage applied to automotive industry 
 
Wood pallets are the most commonly used resources in tool storage in the press industry, where components are 
modeled for automotive industry. The aim of this work was to develop AISI 1020 carbon steel metal rack for 
storing the set of cutting, drilling, and folding tools. The collaborating company is a manufacturer of automotive 
components for buses, trucks and pickup trucks. It is located in the municipality of Cruzeiro, São Paulo and 
Metropolitan Sub-Region of Vale do Paraíba and Litoral Norte 4. Methodology used in the execution of this 
project was the microstructural characterization of (AISI 1020) by techniques of metallography, hardness, 
modeling and mechanical simulation, development of metal rack design by technical details in 2D via AutoCad® 
for prototype, or in 3D by means of virtual modeling Cliever Lab (Pro) ® to create a Mock-up. In production and 
operations management the average time of handling of forklifts was analyzed using the timer in the current 
logistic process in the forklift, crane, tool and pallet assembly. The result obtained so far by means of development 
of Metal Rack was the reduction of environmental liabilities, greater storage safety and reduction in time of tool 
movement.

Abstract 
The mining sector is one of the key economic drivers in Southern Africa. However, due to 
mining and minerals processing activities, huge amounts of waste are generated that have 
potential negative impacts to the environment. Various wastes such as wastewater, particulate 
gases, overburden, waste rocks, tailings and slag are generated during the value addition of 
the ores. Although there is potential for metal recovery and wastewater re-use from this waste 
generated it is critical that before a mining activity is done, an environmental impact 
assessment be done for sustainable mining activities. 
Keywords: Environment, mining, waste management, value addition 
1. Introduction
The mining industry is one of the industries that contributes significantly to the gross domestic product (GDP) 
capita of all mining countries, in Zimbabwe alone, the mining sector contributes at least 8% towards the GDP 
(Adler and Rascher, 2007; Hawkins 2009; Malinga, 2018). Table 1 gives a summary of the GDP growth in the 
mining sector.

potential to result acid rain. These waste rocks therefore must be characterized, monitored and treated to avoid 
environmental damage.  
5. Mining waste management during and post closure 
Mining waste management is critical to minimize water, soil and air contamination. Waste management plans 
are usually planned for during the environmental impact assessment (EIA) stage following the set international 
standards (Mahonye and Mandishara, 2015). In Zimbabwe the EIA process is monitored under the Ministry of 
Water, Environment and Climate Change under the Environmental Management Act (CAP 20: 27) of 2002 
which has made it mandatory for any prospective miners to have proper waste management initiatives through 
the EIA. Waste must be contained at the source and treated to make it environmentally safe for disposal. Post 
mining closure it must be ensured that the tailings are covered and that there escape from the environment is 
minimized in order to prevent groundwater contamination. Mining closure and post closure waste management 
initiatives must form part of the environmental impact assessment.  
6. Conclusion 
As a way forward in mining waste management there is need for a waste management plan o for the pre-
opening, operations and post closure of a mine so that mining becomes a sustainable and environmentally 
friendly industry. Technologies that generate minimal waste must be employed and in addition resource 
recovery initiatives for all the types of waste generated.

Abstract 
In this current century people are straggling against safe food and good life with happiness. In absent of quality and 
safe food, people are suffering by several types of diseases like diabetics, multidimensional cancers, many more 
Non/communicable diseases. Despite the relationship, coordination and proper monitoring in developing world like 
Bangladesh in higher risk in safe food. To coordinated traceability in the food chain became outward in the 1990s 
following several food crises in Europe, most notably the BSE1 crisis is a learning point for developing world. A 
possible significant adverse impact is going to occur if not taken any preventive action for safe food through ensuring 
traceability in food production, processing and marketing. One notable exception is that customer traceability is not 
required for operators who sell solely to the final consumer. In reasons beyond there were several diseases were attack 
to people. It was gradually increasing for long which was really cross the tolerance level in many cases. In this study 
we have been trying to identify and analysis recent food traceability situation in Bangladesh and we focused what 
were the actual reasons for, which level of contaminated food taking by human in their daily meal. However, it is very 
tuff job, but we did study on some specific sample basis particularly the food which frequently consume by people. 
In 19th century food crisis was the main determination in the world but in the last 2-3 decades situation has improved 
a lot, but now main challenges are safe food for generations’ survival.

Abstract  
  
In-process surface roughness (Ra) prediction systems for CNC machining incorporate quality control inspection while 
machining instead of performing inspection post-production. Such systems generally consist of a sensing technology 
and a decision making model. Data preprocessing is established as a necessary but often overlooked step in data 
analysis. Using acoustic emission (AE) signals as a sensing technology and artificial neural network (ANN) as a 
decision making model, the researchers were able to build and compare two ANN models using input variables feed 
rate, frequency, and peak volume— an original unfiltered ANN and a quality control-based filtered ANN which uses 
an individual quality control chart as a data preprocess. Based on a milling process dataset, results show that the 
QCbased ANN model makes better, more accurate Ra predictions, with a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0214, 
compared to the original unfiltered ANN, with an MSE of 0.0189. These results prove the success of the QC-based 
in-process ANN Ra prediction system.

Introduction  
  
CNC machining has been in use by many modern manufacturing companies such as those in the aerospace and 
automobile industry which typically use CNC machining for end milling operations, helping to improve product 
quality, while increasing productivity. However, CNC machining does not guarantee total defect elimination. The 
machining operations that the CNC is capable of are subject to various factors that influence the outcome and thus the 
quality of the products (Huang et al., 2015).  
  
Quality control inspection is used to ensure that defective products do not reach the market. The problem with 
inspection, on the other hand, is that it takes too much time and labor to execute. Although it ensures quality, it 
sacrifices productivity in the process, thus increasing cost as well (Huang, 2002).  
  
Previous researches have aimed to solve this problem by proposing in-process monitoring systems (Chen & Huang, 
2003; Delio et al., 1992; García Plaza et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2016; Yen et al., 2013) that ensure product quality in real 
time at the least possible cost. The goal is to incorporate quality control within the machining instead of performing 
quality control after the defects have occurred.

The modelling data has an MSE of 0.0214 for the LM-GD-TANSIG-ORIGINAL network, and 0.01898 for the LM- 
GD-TANSIG-QC network. The improvement, by observation is a decrease in MSE of around 0.0024. The LM-
GDTANSIG-ORIGINAL and LM-GD-TANSIG-FILTERED network has an MSE of 0.0239 and 0.0219 respectively 
for the verification data. There has been a decrease in MSE of around 0.0219.  
  
Although in both modelling and verification the MSE for the filtered network decreased, a hypothesis t-test was done 
to determine if these differences are significant enough to be valid.  
  
Considering that there are 40 data that comprise the verification data, this data size may be too small to draw an 
accurate conclusion. In the same sense, the modelling data is comprised of 200 and 189 data for the original ANN and 
QC-based ANN models respectively. This relatively larger dataset makes it more reliable to draw conclusions from. 
The existence of a significant difference between the two MSEs for the modelling data is enough to conclude the 
success of the proposed system; that is, that by comparison, the QC-based ANN model and its network LM-
GDTANSIG-QC was able to yield more accurate Ra prediction values than the network LM-GD-TANSIG-
ORIGINAL from the original ANN model.

Conclusion  
  
Two ANN models were built and compared – one original model and one quality control-based model. The difference 
is that the latter made use of an individual quality control chart to filter out Ra data that lie beyond the 3-sigma limits. 
Both models consist of modelling data and verification data. Following the experimental design that determines how 
many training parameter combinations to use, 168 combinations were tried. Both models yielded the lowest MSE 
using LM as the training function, GD as the learning function, and TANSIG as the transfer function. Ra predictions 
were simulated and compared for both networks. In both occasions, the MSE values decreased, which means the 
quality control-based ANN model yields more accurate Ra predictions than the original one. To further validate, a 
hypothesis test was performed. Although no significant difference was found between the MSE values of the 
verification data, the modelling data showed significant results.  
  
The success of the system may be attributed to the new behavior of the modelling data after the data preprocess done 
in building the QC-based ANN model. With new actual Ra values that do not go beyond the 3 sigma limits, the 189 
Ra data lie closer to each other and were therefore more precise. After ANN simulation of the QC-based model, the 
simulated Ra values became more reliable in drawing predictions.

Abstract 
Nowadays as economies rapidly have developed, the scale of trade and quantities of shipping goods have 
caused ship size to expand to size never previously seen. By August 2017, there were 60 mega-
containerships with capacities over 18,000 TEUs. There were 165 those ships including ships with 
capacities over 14,000 TEUs. From the above, since the volume of maritime freight transport has 
increased so significantly, the liner shipping companies have also benefited from this containerization and 
mega-vessels era. In order to being fully effective on employing mega-containerships, at a terminal where 
mega-containerships are calling, most cargoes to be handled are transshipments from origin to destination 
ports via that terminal. Thus, associated handling operations are undertaken between mega-containerships 
and feeder ships. In order to decrease the turnaround time of ships calling at this terminal, smooth 
handling of operations is of major importance. For such as the above terminal, there are the scheduling 
problems for ship-to-berth assignment in Imai et al.(2007) and so on. In that study, it is given in advance 
that the handling time required from the ship berthing position to the container storage location in the 
yard. Normally, the handling time spent for a ship is determined by the number of containers handled and 
the QC assigned to that ship. However, we consider the above scheduling problems at the terminal with 
long quay consisted of multiple-berth ranged in a line. Thus we consider the model to estimate the 
handling time spent for the ship. Additionally, this paper also considers the storage arrangement for 
transshipment containers which are unloaded from ships (as inbound) and are loaded to other ships (as 
outbound). Due to the above issues, some situations can be considered as follows. Since a large number of 
ships call at relevant terminals, a high workload will be needed at quay side operations unload and load to 
the relevant ships. This situation offers a great challenge to yard management. Congestion in the yard area 
prolongs the time containers are handled and ships’ departure from the terminal may be delayed. This 
causes a backup of following ships that have to wait until the relevant ships’ departure. A domino effect 
occurs and will delay the ships calling to the next port. This is one of the bottleneck issues in the hub-and-
spoke system. Therefore, the efficiency of quay side operations at a container terminal depends on smooth 
and efficient handling operations at the yard side. Using the estimated time of ship handling, our proposed 
approach that optimizes the yard arrangement along with the ship-to-berth assignment was applied in the 
genetic algorithm. The iterative approach, which first optimizes the ship-to-berth assignment and then 
optimizes the yard arrangement, is iterated. Total service times obtained by the proposed approach were 
shorter than those done by the iterative one, in most cases under three average intervals of ship arrival. 
Additionally, the CPU times spent by the proposed approach were less than those done by the iterative 
approach in all cases. Therefore this paper’s contribution is, the proposed approach outperformed the 
existing iterative one in both the computational results and CPU times.

Abstract 
Control charts graphically verify variation in quality parameters. Attribute type control charts deal with quality 
parameters that can only hold two states e.g. good or bad, yes or no, etc. Various control charts are developed based 
on the underlying distribution of the quality parameters, e.g., u and c-charts for Poisson distribution, p and np-charts 
for binomial distribution, and also some non-parametric charts when the underlying distribution is uncertain. In 
construction of p-control chart using binomial distribution, the value of proportion non-conforming must be known 
or estimated from limited sample information. This may cause the control limits to shrink and often result in false 
detection when the process is actually in control. In this study, a statistical control chart is proposed based on 
hyperbinomial distribution when prior estimate of proportion non-conforming is unavailable and is estimated from 
limited sample information.

1. Introduction 
In the 21st century, the global industry has witnessed some major changes in trend. Quality has become a major 
norm for success not only in industrial sector but also in service sector. The ""Quality Revolution"" started in Japan 
after the World War II. Now all the developed countries have given prime importance to the issue of quality. People 
have started to realize the importance of quality and consequences of bad quality. In the earlier stage, quality was 
totally inspection based. Inspection aimed at finding and sorting the defective items. The actions were mostly 
reactive after the fault has occurred and any sort of corrective actions were impossible. After some time people 
realized that inspection based systems are often time consuming and expensive to conduct. Then the idea of 
sampling came forward where random samples were taken for further statistical analysis to evaluate the capability of 
the process. This is known as Statistical Process Control and Statistical Quality Control (SPC/SQC). Various tools 
were developed in the process to analyze the performance of the process based on sample information. Control chart 
is the most popular and widely used among the tools used in Statistical Quality control (Hasin 2007). Control charts 
are easy to interpret by observing the data graphically. Process status (in control/out of control) can be easily 
understood and interpreted by simply observing the control chart. Walter Shewhart of Bell Laboratory introduced 
the idea of control chart to identify variation and trend in quality parameters (Montgomery 2007). There are several 
sources of variation such as machine, man, environment, etc. The upmost target of control chart is to monitor this 
variation and eventually control it. However, the rapid improvement of science and technology has led to 
enhancement of processes to such extent that traditional control charts are showing problems in performance or 
practical implementation. Control charts can be classified into two broad categories: variable control charts and 
attribute control charts (Montgomery 2007). There are some quality characteristics which are evaluated non-
numerically based on judgment or visualization in order to conclude on any of the two possibilities - conforming or 
non-conforming, yes or no, good or bad, pass or fail, and so on. These are called attribute type quality 
characteristics. Although an attribute control chart is used in non-numeric aspect but often variables are used. The 
result however is always a go-no-go decision. Although data for attribute type quality characteristics can be obtained 
faster than data for variable type quality characteristics, they usually contain less information.

Abstract  
 
Hospitals are increasingly shifting their online review strategy from active listening to proactive engagement by 
ensuring proper response to patients. The patient perspective is increasingly recognized as the central pillar of 
quality in healthcare industry. Working condition in public hospitals has been of great concern worldwide for 
healthcare personnel. Also, due to poor review of a hospital, financial performance is gradually deteriorating which 
leads to migration of healthcare personnel. Reviews of and responses from hospitals vary in different regions of the 
world, thereby process of ranking of hospitals is bounded to a specific region. Quality assurance and improvement 
are crucial factors for an efficient healthcare system. This study investigates the joint effect of management response 
and online reviews on financial performance of hospitals by concentrating on three areas of concern. First, how 
variations in management response both within a hospital and on peer review site affects the motivation of 
healthcare personnel and attracts more patients. Second, a cyclic link depicting the interrelationship among four 
major domains: rating, management response, financial performance and recommendation have been shown. Third, 
a generic model is proposed and an analysis has been done to introduce the concept of region specific factor. A k-
score value of around 93% is obtained for the final model. Also, a case study on Indian hospitals is performed to 
depict the sufficiency of the model.

Abstract 
This work evaluated the potential to use saw dust based bio char in the treatment of mercury 
contaminated gold tailings wastewater. A sample of saw dust was first pyrolysed to produce bio char 
at 250 ◦ for 30 minutes. The bio char was then ground to particle size of 0.5 mm so as to enhance the 
bio adsorption properties as well as to increase the surface area. The bio char which had a surface area 
of 500-700 m2/g was put in contact with the wastewater for 40 hours noting the change in mercury 
content using AAS. The variation in mercury content was noted for changing pH. of 4-8 and bio char 
loading of 2-6 g/L. Highest mercury removal of >90% were noted at pH. of 8 and bio char loading of 
6 g/L. From the study it can be concluded that saw dust based bio char provides an adsorbent that can 
lower mercury content in gold tailings wastewater

1.Introduction 
Mercury is a heavy metal that is readily available and affordable and is widely used in the gold mining sector. 
Gold is processed through various stages which include: ore extraction, crushing, grinding, concentration, 
roasting, metal extraction, metal recovery and refining. The gold processing process using a lot of mercury (Hg) 
as part of its amalgamation process (Figure 1). This mercury like any other heavy metal if disposed to water 
bodies or is in contact with the human body has potential to cause problems in the blood circulatory systems, 
kidney diseases and rheumatoid arthritis due to its toxicity and bio accumulative nature. Tailings that are","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Bangkok, Thailand, March 5-7, 2019 
Adsorption removal efficiency at varying bio char loading 
The adsorption efficiency decreased with increase in the adsorption time of up to 40 hours (Figure 5). The 
highest adsorption efficiency was observed at a loading of 6 g/L and this trend was attributed to the high 
mercury capture by the bio char at high loading.  
 
Figure 5. Adsorption removal efficiency at varying bio char loading 
4. Conclusion 
Bio char from saw dust provides a good raw material for bio adsorbents with good properties for application in 
gold mining wastewater treatment with mercury as the target contaminant. Mercury concentrations were 
significantly reduced to less than 0.004 mg/L for bio char loading of 6 g/L at a pH of 8. The adsorption 
efficiency was as high as 90% and was dependent on the adsorption time, bio char loading and pH of 
wastewater. The treated wastewater can be safely disposed of to water bodies due to the low mercury content 
obtained. The application of saw dust as a biomass derived bio adsorbents provides both a low cost solution for 
gild tailings wastewater treatment and also a waste management solution for saw dust from the timber milling 
industry.

Abstract 
It was established that over a 100 million tons of plastics are produced annually worldwide, and they have become a common 
feature of the overflowing bins and landfill sites. As they are inert and non-degradable, they do not mix or make bond with other 
substances. As a result as we enjoy the conveniences that plastics can provide, the treatment of waste plastics becomes an 
imminently challenging issue. In this regard, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to recycle waste plastics. This research 
study is focused on recycling of waste plastics to derive automotive diesel oil for use to power engines. Waste plastics are first 
treated in a heater at a certain temperature, and then molten plastic is passed into a reactor where its carbon chain break down into 
different components depending on different temperature levels. Then finally, in the distillation chamber various gases and diesel 
fuel fraction are recovered.

1. Introduction 
 
The major challenges posed by climate change as well as striving for security of energy supply are 
contemporary issues high on the political agenda of late. Various nations are putting strategic plans in motion to 
minimize primary energy use. The disposal of waste has to be solved under thrifty, and environmentally 
acceptable and hygienic conditions. Plastics are an integral part of our modern life and are used in almost all 
daily activities. Since plastics are synthesized from non-renewable sources and are not biodegradable, waste 
plastics constitute the serious environmental problems the world faces today. However, waste plastics could 
become a source of energy if relevant treatment technologies are used.

5. Conclusion 
The paper reviewed the material on thermal pyrolysis of waste plastics as an opportunity which can yield the 
production of diesel fuel oil. In the process, valuable resource recovery and reduction of waste problem would 
have been achieved. Thermal pyrolysis of waste plastic waste has several advantages over other alternative 
recycling methods. In summary, it can be concluded that diesel produced from plastic pyrolysis oil could be 
economically used in diesel engine combustion.

Abstract 
This research study reviews the treatment and recyclability of e-waste such as PCBs, e-plastics and CRTs. Land filling and 
incineration were found to be not good management methods as they do not deal with the toxic gases found in e-waste. 
Hydrometallurgy processing methods was developed and used in the extraction of base and precious metals. Since precious metal 
leaching is affected by copper content, to maximize precious metal leaching, a 2 step base metal leaching stage was employed. 
The first step mainly focused on the removal of Pb and Fe and the second step was to extract copper, zinc and nickel. First stage 
used nitric acid and the second stage used sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Lead recovery was almost 90% and copper 
recovery amounted to almost 95%. Precious metal leaching utilized ammonium thio-sulphate as the lixiviant and gold recovery 
was low,  but silver recovery was significantly high.

1. Introduction 
 
The unprecedented growth of the electronic sector industry in the world, together with the rate of technological 
change has created an appetite among consumers for a replacement behavior leading to stockpiles of e-waste 
(Mutsau, et al., 2015).Electronic waste products include used cell phones, television sets, laptops, fridges, 
microwaves and all devices that have an electronic circuit board in them. E-waste contain many constituents which 
include printed circuit boards(PCBs), plastics, steel, cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and other particles in smaller 
proportions. E-waste management and beneficiation is a subject that deals with proper planning and controlling of e-
waste disposal in order to benefit from e-waste. E-waste management and beneficiation is not only done to make 
money but also as a way to preserve the environment in a bid to foster sustainable development of e-waste. This 
work therefore seeks to develop sustainable processes of managing and recycling e-waste so as to preserve the 
environment and also improve the livelihoods of people by recovering both precious and base metals from PCBs. 
The processing system should be able to detoxify the dangerous trace elements found in PCBs and e-plastics, as well 
as being affordable to people who may want to venture into the recycle industry. 
 
2. Overview of e-waste leaching 
 
According to (Kavitha, 2014), e-waste describes all the electronic and electrical gadgets that have reached the end of 
their use. Over the past decade the increase in electronic waste has reached unprecedented levels and this can be 
attributed to fierce competition among technology manufacturing companies, the need to produce superior gadgets 
and the appetite amongst consumers to change electronic gadgets. Advancement in technology has decreased the 
lifespan of electronic gadgets, leading to an upsurge in the generation of WEEE which in turn leads to the generation 
of vast quantities of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). A printed or wiring circuit board (PCB) is 
a piece of material hardware usually made of steel, wood and plastic and is used as a base to provide electrical 
connections to the components that have been mounted like resistors and capacitors(Gadekar, 2008).It is on these 
PCBs that a majority of metals are concentrated. Advancements in technology in EEE have reduced PCBs life span,

The factors that affects precious metal leaching are temperature, pulpy density, pH range, left over Cu content,

6. Recommendations 
For effective leaching, more emphasis has to be put on the pre-treatment of PCBs before precious metal leaching. 
Pre-treatment is an indispensable technique that cannot be done without as it affects precious metal leaching. The 
low yielding of gold could be attributed to the ineffective pretreatment stage as there would be a high percentage of 
leftover Cu, which inhibits both gold and silver leaching. PCBs contain an epoxy resin which contain solder that 
consists of lead and tin. By using a very strong organic solution, the pre-treatment stage can be able to leach all the 
lead and tin contained in those solders. Layers of epoxy resin also contain copper and by utilizing an organic 
solution that can be able to seep all the copper from the resin, precious metal leaching will be increased. 
Conclusions 
For effective precious metal extraction, PCB leaching was conducted in a 2 stage process in a bid to remove all the 
base metals especially Cu which could hinder precious metal leaching. Several parameters that affect precious metal 
leaching were identified and these were temperature, pulp density, thiosulphate concentration and ammonia 
concentration. For both Au and Ag leaching, the ratio of thiosulphate concentration to ammonia concentration 
should be between 0.5 and 1. That ratio has to be kept in that range if higher yields are to be realized. Lower pulp 
density of 25g/L yielded better results compared to a higher pulp density of 50g/L. This could be attributed to the 
fact the higher the amount of reagent per unit weight of PCBs the higher the yield. The effect of temperature is 
different on Au and Ag. For Au leaching, the optimum temperature was 400C and for Ag, the optimum temperature 
was 250C.

Abstract 
The research study investigated the prospect of coming up a design of a mechanical solar tracker, which would minimize 
human effort during operation. The affordable design would be compatible with different solar panel configurations for both 
domestic and industrial purposes. The mechanism would enable the panel to be placed at the best angle of exposure to 
sunlight for collection of energy as the sun moves across the sky throughout the day, as it incorporates the solar arrays to 
keep the array pointed towards the sun. It would have a provision for fitting solar panels to ensuring that the maximum 
amount of sunlight strikes the panels throughout the day. The system would be  mounted on a pole 2.5 metres high, with a 
2m by 1.5m  panel  to increase surface area for absorption of radiation. The set up is expected to generate about 20 - 25% 
more power when compared to a static solar model that are commercially available. It was established that installing the 
solar panels on a tracking base increases efficiency of the solar panels to 80%.

1. Introduction
Energy crisis is the most important issue in the world today (World Energy Council, 2016). Non polluting 
renewable energy resources are getting more attention as a way to lessen the dependency on conventional 
sources of energy. Solar energy is rapidly gaining the focus as an important means of expanding renewable 
energy uses, it is promising technology, being clean, silent, and reliable with very small maintenance costs 
and small ecological impacts. So, there is need to enhance the utilization of solar by increasing the 
efficiency of the solar cell to reduce the cost. It is in this regard that solar tracking system technology in 
taken on board to enhance the efficiency of the solar cells by tracking the sun throughout the day. There is 
great potential in solar energy harvesting from solar radiation as has been outlined so as to increase energy 
efficiency and also there is need for zero pollution energy production systems for the environmental 
friendliness.  
2. Background
Most of the energy production is dependent on fossil fuels. The resources of the fossil fuels are limited and their 
use results in global warming due to emission of greenhouse gases. To provide a sustainable power production 
and safe world to the future generation, there is a growing demand for energy from renewable sources like solar, 
wind, geothermal and ocean tidal wave. The sun is the prime source of energy, directly or indirectly, which is 
also the fuel for most renewable systems. By 2015, 164 countries around the world had renewable energy 
support policies in support (International Energy Agency, 2016). Solar panel directly converts solar radiation 
into electrical energy. Solar panel is mainly made from semiconductor materials. Silicon used as the major 
component of solar panels, which is maximum 24.5% efficient. Unless high efficient solar panels are invented, 
the only way to enhance the performance of a solar panel is to increase the intensity of light falling on it. Solar 
trackers are the most appropriate and proven technology to increase the efficiency of solar panels through 
keeping the panels aligned with the sun’s position. The point of maximum received energy is reached when the 
direction of the solar radiation is perpendicular on the panel surface thus an increase of the output energy of a 
photo-voltaic panel can be obtained by mounting the panel on a solar tracking device that follows the sun’s 
trajectory. By using tracked solar arrays, a series of solar cells electrically connected, a DC voltage is generated 
more efficiently which can be physically used on a load. The power output of the solar panel is dependent on the 
amount of light that reaches the solar cell. Photovoltaic technology is most efficient when it is greeted by a light 
source at a perfectly perpendicular angle. In order to accomplish this, the PV panel must move with the sun to 
maintain this perpendicular angle. A solar tracking mechanism is an effort to increase the efficiency of power 
generation through the solar module. The conventional solar modules are stationary hence the sun rays falling

The algorithm and code listing for motor control is generated by input of voltages from two LDRs which are 
analogue when converted to digital. When the two digital values are compared and the difference between them 
obtained, this gives the error proportional to the angle of rotation of the servo motor. If the LDR voltages are the 
same, the servo stops. Otherwise, the servo rotates until the difference is the same.

5. Recommendations and conclusion 
Although a solar tracker was designed on a portable scale, it is economic if it is be implemented on a much 
larger scale. For locations off or away from the equator dual axis trackers may be handy for capturing maximum 
solar radiation. It is recommended that in future, one may consider the use of more efficient sensors, which are 
cost effective and consume little power for this application. This would further enhance efficiency. 
 
A solar panel that tracks the sun was designed and implemented. The required program that specified the 
various actions needed for the program to work was written. As a result, solar tracking was achieved. The 
system designed was a single tracker. While dual axis trackers are more efficient in tracking the sun, the 
additional circuitry and complexity was not required in this case. This is because Zimbabwe lies near the 
equator and therefore there are no significant changes in the apparent position of the sun during the various 
seasons. Dual axis trackers are more suitable in regions where there is a change in the position of the sun.

Abstract
Pricing is very crucial for every underwriter in insurance industry. The premium rate set by an underwriter must obtain 
profit for the company considering that the insurance policy is at risk of numerous numbers of covered perils. Also on 
this note, the price should be at the rate that motivates people to purchase the service. The depth of this research is 
how to update the current pricing of insurance for engineering projects that will benefit the insurance company. There 
are various models with various parameters considered for setting the premium rate of the insurance of engineering 
projects. These were examined to become more compatible on the insurance of engineering projects. The outcome 
shows that premium rate will increase from 5% to 15% of the existing rate. Better insurers’ premium to loss ratio will 
be easily attained with this scenario. But on the side on the insured this is something that they would consider before 
getting the insurance. So, with this scenario the insurer should always be flexible to the wants of the insured and make 
the necessary adjustments for the benefit of the insured and insurer.

1. Introduction
Finance Service Industry is the elixir for every business structure. It encompasses a broad range of organizations that 
deal with the management of money. It influences all sections of the society and sectors of the economy. These are 
the industries that support a company or an individual in case a loss will incur. Among these organizations are banks, 
credit card companies, consumer finance, investment funds, insurance companies, stock brokerages and some 
government sponsored enterprises. 
Insurance instruments are only one of many options in risk management. The first, and arguably the highest priority 
in risk management, is to invest here to preventing or mitigating human and economic losses. 
The concept of insurance is a transfer of risk between the insured and an insurer. An insured will pay the appropriate 
premium to the insurer and the insurer will assume some risks from the insured, which will be defined within an 
insurance policy. The peak of this risk transfer comes when the insured suffers a covered loss and the insurance 
company should pay its absolute amount of claim.  
A significant research has been done to see the impact of property-casualty claims handling on the insurers operations, 
more specifically as it pertains to the insurer’s productivity and profitability (Epermis and Harrington, 2006). This 
was very close to engineering insurance. They both belong in the group of non-life insurance category. These claims 
will be a big factor that may make or break an insurer’s profit in engineering insurance considering these are big 
accounts.  
Another study has been done to validate the deductible of personal home owners insurance in the United States. This 
is to check if the underwriters are giving the proper deductible to every policyholder that would benefit the insured 
and insurer (Braun, 2006).

• 
Market Research and Analysis–Competition is always present in every market the insurance company should 
make an analysis of what is the current premium rating per every nature of work on the market so that they can 
adjust the premium rating and make the necessary changes for it to be acceptable on part of the company. 
• 
Proven prototype of the project – This is for the unusual engineering projects; during the underwriting stage this 
should be a requirement for the underwriter to know what could be their risk exposure. 
• 
Use of MRPC tool for underwriting – This is a software to gauge what could be the underwriting terms and 
conditions for the unusual engineering projects. 
 
c. 
Evaluation of Risk - During the risk evaluation phase decisions have to be made concerning which risks need 
adjustment on premium rate and which do not, as well as concerning on the adjustment priorities. Below is the 
requirement for this evaluation of risk. 
• 
Consequences of the given premium rate, deductible and policy endorsements – This should be aligned to the 
covered claims that company is encountering so that it could immediately adjust on the underwriting process. 
• 
Occurrence of covered peril during claims – The number of occurrence of covered peril should be checked and 
updated in the underwriting terms and conditions so that if it would happen again, the insurer would lessen their 
liability on the claim. 
 
After establishing this risk assessment on the different engineering projects, if the clients do not accept the proposal, 
below is the contingency plan for the insurer.

The above was the plan of action if the broker or the insured insisted on their request to either lower the premium rate 
or lower the deductible of the project that they are going to seek insurance on that engineering project. The solution 
to this scenario is that make the lost amount multiplied by a certain factor and add this to the premium rate or deductible 
to compensate the requirements of the insured provided that only a standard coverage was being offered to them. If 
they want both premium rate and deductible to be lowered, the underwriter should take only a certain percentage to 
be retained under the treaty to lessen the risk of exposure from that insured engineering project. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
This research provides an in depth analysis of a risk management based econometric modeling of insurance 
underwriting in engineering projects. The application of this model was only focused on two types of engineering 
insurance which are the Contractors All Risk (CAR) and Erection All Risk (EAR). These two have the same types of 
risk. It is just a matter of composition of which contract works were dominant between civil works and installation 
works. To test the data from the real world scenario, the study used the records of accounts of PMMSC. Different 
statistical tools were used to determine the relationship between the existing factors of the company, risk factors and 
econometric factors. The outcomes of the factors were all statistically significant using normality tests. This indicates 
that all the given data were normally distributed. During the correlation of variables between the premium production 
of CAR policy and EAR policy versus its claims, it was illustrated that the premium was not sufficient enough to pay 
the claims. As a result, the premium to loss ratio required by the PMMSC was not attained. These were shown on 
graph that as the claims were increased, the premium productions were decreased. Underwriting was the main reason 
for this occurrence. It means that there were factors that were not included on the premium rate evaluation. Another

test was made to determine the additional factors that would give low premium to loss ratio. Multiple regression was 
used to single out what would be the additional factors on underwriting insurance of engineering projects. The outcome 
pointed that the type of risk was very essential on underwriting. The type of risk was expounded to give another 
perspective of the premium. The new factors found were based on the document that the company asks from the 
insured. For CAR, the factors were the type of foundation, surrounding property, type of soil, exposure to acts of 
nature peril and number of storey and basement. In EAR, the factors were the type of equipment or machines to be 
installed, degree of exposure of the equipment or machine to human error, exposure to acts of nature perils, type of 
foundation. This was applied to the risk assessment made on the previous data of CAR policy and EAR policy 
including its previous parameters. As a modification to the existing formula of premium rate on the literature, the 
study combined the risk management and econometric modeling to make it applicable to the insurance of engineering 
projects. Econometric factors were also included on the formula like volume of exposure at time, market average 
premium rate, interposal discount rate (subjective), finite time horizon and range of premium rate. These factors were 
utilized on the engineering premium rate formula to make it more applicable to insurance of engineering projects. 
After simulating the new factors and existing factors, it was evident that there was a decrease in premium to loss ratio 
of the company which was close to the standard of PMMSC.  
 
The new found formula can be modified again by the insurance company who will use it. The factors can be increased 
in the risk management formula of this study as long as it would follow the rules of multiplication of matrices. 
Underwriting profit will increase using the new model. This will create a big impact on underwriting insurance for 
engineering projects. The underwriters can now simulate a given risk and update their guidelines using these formulas 
as their basis. The insurance company can gain additional profit from this revised premium rate. The outcome was 
also reliant on the external environmental factors which will be significant on the underwriting these kind of risk. The 
underwriters should always be updated on what acts of nature will come, so that they can put some warranty or clauses 
that will help to reduce catastrophic claims.

Abstract 
Every customer has a unique intent at the back of his mind when shopping in a retail store. It could be monthly 
stocking, food for an outdoor party or for organizing a children’s picnic. Being able to understand and predict the items 
a customer is likely to choose, depending on his intent, could help online retail companies to gain competitive 
advantage via targeted advertisements. The extant literature in this field mainly deals with customer segmentation and 
basket association for products. Attempt to understand the intent of each customer visit is a relatively new area of study, 
which has been mainly restricted to physical retail stores. This study extends this idea for online retails, where data like 
customer views and add to carts are also available, allowing us to group each visit more effectively. We intend to 
identify the “shopping mission” behind every customer visit and hence we use the customer's interaction data with the 
products to group different visits via clustering. Previous attempts at clustering have mostly focussed on using widely 
used clustering algorithms like the K-Means clustering. However, we identify that this may not be the best suited 
method to exploit the binary matrix structure of the data. Hence, we further propose the use of a better suited clustering 
method like the rank order clustering that makes use of this binary data structure. We have chosen the open source data 
from Retail Rocket, an online retail company, to validate our propositions.

Abstract  
 
A major issue in manufacturing is the low cost production and supply of products in response to variable demand 
while ensuring no sales opportunity is missed. In previous studies, many factors affecting production allocation, 
such as the number of workers and working hours, have been examined. In contrast, we have worked on the 
development of a new method to simply determine the production quantity “balanced (harmonized) between 
inventory reduction and heijyunka (production leveling),” based on the demand quantity and the inventory quantity. 
We have proposed a harmonized model of inventory reduction (lowering energy of inventory management) and 
production leveling (increasing entropy of production allocation) based on the “maximum entropy principle.” In this 
study, we attempt a “dual approach” to exchange the objective function and the constraint to the harmonized model 
and propose a new model based on the “minimum average-energy principle.” This enables multifaceted analysis of 
harmonized levels between production leveling and inventory reduction.

1.  Introduction  
 
The manufacturing industry has experienced major changes in its market environment in recent years, and 
manufacturing and supplying at low cost, without missing sales opportunities, has become a significant issue against 
a backdrop of changing demand. Therefore, production and inventory management has a difficult problem to solve 
by finding a balance between “agile production,” allowing the supply of products to the market in a timely manner 
for inventory reduction, and “stable (leveled) production,” which is aimed at reducing manufacturing costs. It is an 
even more important issue for manufacturers of seasonal products, in particular, while in production planning,  
especially aggregate production planning, the production planning problem must be determined for each production 
quantity per period through the planning period (Kuroda 1994).

4.2   Results and discussion  
Table 3 shows the results of the minimum value of the inventory management energy for each case under numerical 
examples, as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. Further, Table 4 shows the results of the production quantity determined 
for Case 2. In addition, Table 5 shows the result of obtaining the maximum value of the production allocation 
entropy for each case, assuming the inventory management energy determined in Table 3 to be constant, based on 
the base model (Kurihara and Yamashita 2013). 
 
First, we found that the minimum value of inventory management energy decreases as the smoothing coefficient 
decreases. Production with a small smoothing coefficient means “agile production” with high capability to follow 
demand fluctuation, and can reduce inventory quantity, so it will be a reasonable result. 
 
Next, it is understood that the dual relationship between the proposed model of this study and the base model 
(Kurihara and Yamashita 2013) exists, comparing the relationship between the constant production allocation 
entropy and the minimum inventory management energy in Table 3 and the relationship between the constant 
inventory management energy and the maximum production allocation entropy in Table 5. From the above, the 
validity of the proposed model of this study is suggested.

5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we proposed a dual approach to the harmonized model between inventory reduction and production 
leveling (“heijyunka”) based on the minimum average-energy principle, and confirmed the validity of the proposed 
approach and model. By the proposed model, under the current production facilities and capabilities (given state of 
production leveling, that is, production allocation entropy associated with the smoothing coefficient), it will be 
possible to seek the optimal production quantity that minimizes the inventory management workload (energy) 
associated with inventory quantity. Also, multifaceted analysis on harmonized level between “heijyunka” and 
inventory reduction, including minimization of inventory management energy to maximization of production 
allocation entropy, will be possible.

Abstract 
Considering organization, manufacturing unit or products as a living organism and develop related DNA is one of 
research areas that attracted researchers over the years. Actually, a variety of research directions and different 
applications is identifiable in the literature. Therefore, a systematic literature review conducted and Virtual DNA (V-
DNA) applications’ diagram proposed. Based on the proposed diagram, V-DNA research areas classified to three 
main research areas namely Organization DNA (O-DNA), Manufacturing DNA (M-DNA), and Decisional-DNA (D-
DNA). For each one of those research areas, a list of applications presented based on the reviewed literature. 
Furthermore, a list of future research directions extracted from the most recent papers and summarized in the synthesis 
section. Authors in the current research suggested to expand the research efforts in all DNAs research areas and try to 
integrate those efforts to create a comprehensive DNA that encompass all organization levels, from product all the 
way to the highest level of the organization considering the necessary correlations between all units and levels, to 
ensure establishment of improvement projects and take decisions’ able to maximize organization performance and 
avoid the contradictions coming from improvements that may improve one area but has a negative impact on other 
areas.

1. Introduction
DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is “the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms”. Each organism 
consists of trillions of cells, in each cell, in the nucleus of the cell, each organism has a set of chromosomes, and 
human has 23 pairs of chromosomes. Each chromosomes contains many genes, and each gene made up of DNAs. 
DNA presented in the literature as a double helix, see Figure.1, and it is consist of chemical bases and other 
components. DNA contains all organism features, i.e. length, color, sex, eye color, hair color….etc. which organism 
got from his parents’ DNAs (Genetics Home Reference, 2017). For humans or any other organism, it happens that 
some genes will have some changes, positive or negative, from the standard genes, which lead sometime to disorders 
in the organism features, e.g. genetic diseases, recessive traits, and congenital disorders. Therefore, Genetic 
engineering (GE) science developed. GE is “a set of techniques for isolating, modifying, multiplying and recombining 
genes from different organisms, genetic engineering science has been developed to reform consciously the 
chromosomes for living beings to accentuate good characteristics or to clone living beings according to their 
chromosomes”, see references there in (Chen and Feng, 2003). 
Virtual DNA (V-DNA) approach has been used in the literature in different scopes. E.g. Organizational DNA 
terminology has been used in the literature to describe organization elements namely organization structure, 
organization members, organization systems, and organization culture. The structure element may contain reporting 
structure, information flows, decision process, and process flows. Members element related to all staff aspects. 
Systems element related to organization performance system, control systems…. etc. and culture element related to 
organization behaviors and values (Carroll, 2016), page 520-521. Carroll (2016), in the pages 520-521, stated that 
organizational DNA was used in very unspecific way and it needs to be unpacked. Organizational DNA can be defined 
as a “metaphor that is used to describe the essence of an organization’s identity” (Carroll, 2016), page 520. V-DNA 
has been used as well to describe the mechanical products design and its optimization process (Chen and Feng, 2004; 
Chen, Feng and Chen, 2005), and to develop knowledge structure assist organization to develop “Virtual Engineering 
Object (VEO), Virtual Engineering Process (VEP) and Virtual Engineering Factory (VEF)” (Shafiq, Sanin, 
Szczerbicki, et al., 2016; Sanin et al., 2017). Therefore, the objectives of this paper is identify the applications of V-
DNA approach in the state of the art literature, and the future research directions. Thus, a systematic literature review 
process will be conducted.  
In the current research, based on the systematic literature review, V-DNA research areas and applications available in 
the literature analyzed critically. After that, a diagram of V-DNA research areas and its related applications proposed. 
Moreover, an insight about future research directions presented. This paper is structured as follows: first, research 
motivations outlined; second, research questions devised; third, research methodology explained; fourth, literature

Abstract 
Container stowage problems are rich optimization problems with both high economic and environmental impact. 
These problems are typically decomposed into a master bay planning phase, which distributes containers to bay 
sections of the vessel, and a slot planning phase, which assigns a specific slot within the bay section to each container. 
In this paper, we extend existing models for slot planning by considering containers with dangerous goods. An 
important contribution of this paper is that we provide a model closer to the real-world problems faced by planners, 
and thus solutions based on this model should be easier to implement in practice. We show that our model can be 
solved to optimality in reasonable time using standard software like Gurobi or CPLEX.

1. Introduction
During the last six decades, the use of containers has increased the efficiency of worldwide trade. According to 
Steenken et al. (2004) over 60% of the world’s deep-sea general cargo is transported in containers, and the routes 
between some countries are containerized up to 90%. The majority of containers are transported by vessels called 
container ships, which are specifically designed to carry containers. Apart from the few years of financial crisis, the 
shipping industry has had a continuous growth (Christensen and Pacino, 2017). With the increasing level of world 
trade and the corresponding increase in size of container ships (up to around 21,000 containers  (Wikipedia, 2017)) 
one of the main areas for cost and efficiency gains in the industry is to have an efficient stowage plan to facilitate fast 
container loading and unloading. However, because of its combinatorial nature and the various operational constraints 
related to both the ship structure and container properties, stowage planning is a complex problem. To handle the 
complexity of the stowage planning problem, we use an approach similar to some of the recently most successful 
approaches, see, e.g., Pacino et al. (2011), Pacino et al. (2012), Kang and Kim (2002), Wilson and Roach (2000), Wei-
ying et al. (2005), which decompose the problem into two phases: the Master Bay Planning Problem and the Slot 
Planning Problem. The  Master Bay Planning Problem distributes the containers to bay sections of the vessel, the Slot 
Planning Problem then assigns the containers in each bay section to specific slots. In this paper, we develop a new and 
more realistic binary programming model for the Slot Planning Problem.  
The main contributions of our paper is that we include containers with dangerous goods, so-called IMO containers 
(IMO - International Maritime Organization), in our model, and that we define the decision variables in a more realistic 
way than what has been done before. In addition, we show that, despite these extensions, the model can be solved to 
optimality in reasonable time. According to Delgado et al. (2012), one second is a reasonable runtime for slot planning 
problems.

All experiments have been run on a Linux machine with Intel Core i7-5600U, CPU 2.60GHz x4 and 16 GB of memory. 
The model was implemented in Pyomo and solved with Gurobi 7.0, which is a state-of-the-art linear solver. Since the 
model is linear, all solutions are globally optimal. The results given in Table 3 show that most of the instances are 
solved to optimality within one second. There are a few instances in almost all sets which have a runtime between two 
and three seconds. This means we are very close to being able to solve realistically sized instances in reasonable time. 
If all SPP instances for a container vessel are solved sequentially in one operation, a runtime of between two and three 
seconds for some instances will not be a problem, as the average runtime is well below one second.  
 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have extended known models for the Slot Planning Problem to include proper handling of IMO 
containers according to segregation rules for such containers. The problem has been rigorously described, and is 
formulated as a pure binary programming problem. Computational experiments show that the model can be solved to 
optimality in reasonable time using standard commercial software.

Abstract 
Business excellence and excellent performance realization on organizational level has been attracting many 
researchers in the last two decades. Business Excellence models (BEMs) and their related methodological issues 
subjected as well to deep investigation. However, in the state of the art literature, it has been proved that BEMs still 
have some methodological issues that need to be resolved. In the current paper, as part of ongoing project to evaluate 
BEMs’ EPRMs efficiency and effectiveness, Excellence Performance Realization Methodologies (EPRM) 
terminologies analyzed, and then EPRM defined. Affinity diagram used to extract the necessary information from the 
reviewed literature, organize it, and remove the duplicated information in order to identify the main elements of 
EPRMs. Based on the conducted analysis, six elements of EPRMs proposed namely Equipment, Fundamentals, 
Performance management, Inputs, Process, and Outputs, then conceptual framework for applying EPRMs elements 
proposed. The proposed framework gives an insight, to the researchers and practitioners in organizational excellence 
scope, about the elements need to be exist in any model/methodology adopted to realize excellent performance. For 
future work, the proposed elements and frameworks will be use to evaluate BEMs’ EPRMs to improve BEMs’ 
efficiency and effectiveness.

Excellence, Performance Realization, Methodology, Performance Improvement. 
1. Introduction
In Business Performance Improvement Resource (BPIR) website (EPIR.com), which is a knowledge management 
tool for global benchmarking and best practice formed originally by BPIR.com Limited & Massey University, and 
many international partners, Business Excellence Models (BEMs) are defined as “frameworks that if applied in an 
organization, can help to focus thought and action in a more systematic and structured way that should lead to increased 
performance” (BPIR.com Limited & Massey University., 2002).  
Many researchers proved in their research that BEMs still have some methodological issues that need to be resolved. 
For instance, Rusjan, (2005) stated that EFQM excellence model, one of the main excellence models over the world,“ 
is appropriately structured to perform the first phase of the analysis, i.e. identification of a problematic situation, but 
on the other hand, the model does not offer any specific guidelines about the second phase, i.e. problem identification. 
The model offers no structured approach about how to exploit strengths or about how to classify or prioritize areas 
of improvement”. Grigg and Mann, (2008) stated that most of custodians, and Business Excellence Frameworks 
(BEFs) users agreed on the need to conduct major reviews on the BEMs. However, the period of those reviews 
different from country to other with majority agreed that it should take place each five years. Grigg and Mann, (2008) 
stated as well that to conduct the major review process, the stakeholders should be consulted in the review process. 
Stakeholders includes clients, evaluators, research experts on business excellence scope, BEMs custodians, research 
experts on economic/management trends; influential associations/membership associations, government, and 
businesses not using the framework and Business Excellence (BE) consultants.  
Therefore, this paper aims to identify the elements that should be available in Excellent Performance Realization 
Methodologies (EPRMs) and propose a EPRMs’ framework. The proposed elements and framework will be used in 
the future work to evaluate EPRMs used by dominant BEMs, and identify the gaps and potential improvement areas 
in those methodologies. As a result of analysis conducted in this paper, any EPRMs should consist of six elements 
namely Equipment, Fundamentals, Performance Management, Inputs, Process, and Outputs. In addition, a framework 
proposed to give a roadmap for EPRMs implementation stages and its elements and sub-elements. This paper is 
structured as follows: first, research questions derived; second, research methodology explained; third, literature

Abstract 
Millennials in the workplace have the reputation of being job-hoppers to meet their perception of career improvement. 
While job-hopping may be a way to find better opportunities for these millennials, the turnover of employees in the 
workplace creates four different types of costs which is incurred by the company. This study aims to create a millennial 
employee retention model through examination of the millennial job satisfaction factors, management initiatives and 
the assessment of fit between the millennials and the management. The survey was participated by 318 millennial 
employees and the structured interview was responded by 7 companies in the Philippine telco industry. Chi-square 
tests and one-way ANOVA were used to determine the relationships and the fit between the millennials and the 
management in terms of job satisfaction. Results show a fit in all the job satisfaction factors which meant that the 
management is able to meet the job satisfaction of its millennial employees. Among the eight job satisfaction factors, 
millennials were very satisfied with their relationship with peers/superiors. However, salary and benefits yielded an 
either satisfied or dissatisfied rating in the results.  Companies in the telco industry should implement incentive 
programs to improve the job satisfaction of the millennials in terms of salary and benefits. Findings show that 
Promotion and Career Planning, Work-Life Balance and Training/Career Development were the top three job 
satisfaction factors to retain millennials in the workplace.

1. Introduction
As the digital information age continues to emerge, more and more people get used to live with the technology around 
as part of their daily lives. Through the years, different generations continued to contribute to the innovation and 
technologies around. Generations are defined by age, period and cohort. Period refers to the happening within an 
individual’s lifetime and cohort is referred to as the group of individuals sharing their experiences and events in their 
formative years leading to similar attitudes and behaviors (DeVaney, 2015). Social scientists present four generations 
in the society: the silent generation, the baby boomers, Generation X and the Generation Y – known as the 
“Millennials” (Lopez, 2016 and  Poll, 2015). The silent generation includes those born in the year 1930 to 1945. 
Followed by the baby boomers who were born in 1946 to 1964. Those belonging to the Generation X were born in 
1965 to 1980 while those Generation Y or so-called “millennials” were born in the year 1980 to 2000 (Gallup, 2016; 
DeVaney, 2015;  Cutler, 2015; Culiberg and Mihelic, 2016). Other studies considered millennials as the ones born in 
1981-2000 (Rigoni and Nelson, 2016; Campione, Mumford, Morgeson  & Nahrgang, 2005) and 1980-1996 (Fry, 
2016; Geoffrey and Charles, 1994).  
In a global setting, millennials will comprise three-quarters of the global workforce by 2025 (Deloitte, 2014 and 
Petaschnick, 2017). In the US, millennials are now the largest living generation surpassing the population of the baby 
boomers (Fry, 2016). The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported 28,059,242 as the population of Millennials 
in 2015 which is the second largest in the Philippine population following the largest population of Generation Y 
having 40,270,963. And on the third spot, following the millennials, were the Generation X having 18,629,001. Based 
from these figures, it is shown that majority of the Philippine population is currently in the labor force which are being

2. Job Satisfaction Factors representing the side of the millennial employees composed of three dimensions which are 
Career, Economic and Company Culture-Fit. Career dimension includes Promotion and Career Planning, Training 
and Career Development, Performance Evaluation and Feedback, and Manager Mentorship. The Economic dimension 
involves Salary and Benefits. The last dimension is Company Culture-Fit which includes Personal Alignment with 
Company Goals, Relationship with Peers/Superiors and Work-Life Balance. 
3. The demographic profile in terms of Age Group, Civil Status and Employment Status are to be considered when 
using the model. These demographic variables were tested its relationships and proven to affect the job satisfaction 
factors as well the preferences of millennials. 
4. The Management Initiatives were designed with three dimensions: Career, Economic and Company Culture-Fit. 
These three drivers are composed of the different programs which are to be implemented by the management/HR 
practitioners using the model. 
5. Career in the Management Initiatives is composed of three programs namely: (1) Career Succession Planning, (2) 
Training Needs Analysis and (3) Technical, Management and Leadership Trainings.  
6. Economic in the Management Initiatives is directed on the economic needs of an employee. The programs included 
in Economic are: (1) Incentive Programs, (2) Salary Structuring based from the Industry and (3) Salary Increase/Salary 
Loan.  
7. Company Culture-Fit in the Management Initiatives is a strategy to be able to hire the right employee who will fit 
the job and be with the company for the long-term. It includes the consideration of company values wherein the values 
of the company should match the values of an individual. This could be leadership of the company, characters of 
employees in the company, support of the company to its employees, work ethics within the company and attributes 
that reflect the company that would affect the employee as part of the company. 
8. Lifestyle-Culture Fit refers to the fit between the lifestyle of the millennials to the culture of the company. This is 
an important consideration since millennials have the common lifestyle of travelling, creating social media content 
and exploring their passion outside the work they do. Understanding the millennials lifestyle is a critical factor whether 
he/she will be a good fit to the company as the duties and responsibilities of an employee can affect its lifestyle. While 
on the other hand, culture came from the management side of the model reflecting the company wherein company 
culture is one of the factors affecting the lifestyle and values of a millennial in the workplace. 
9. Millennial employee retention in this model impacts to three outcomes which are: employee turnover rate, turnover 
index to recruitment of replacements and lower turnover costs. Employee turnover rates is to be at minimum because 
of satisfied millennials in the workplace. Lower turnover costs is to address the four types of costs created by employee 
turnover which are recruitment cost, training cost, lost productivity cost and lost sales cost. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Millennials in the workplace are an essential asset comprising the organization. Keeping these millennials satisfied in 
the workplace in terms of their job satisfaction factors is a key to retaining them in the workplace. Through the 
developed millennial retention model, companies can align their current programs and activities to the recommended 
programs of the retention model. Organizations will be able to retain millennials in the workplace by keeping them 
satisfied in the job they do and at the same time minimizing their turnover intention. Millennials in the Philippine 
Telco industry were very satisfied with their relationship with peers/superiors but were either satisfied or dissatisfied 
with their salary and benefits. Thus, only salary and benefits are the factors leading to millennial turnover in the 
workplace. Moreover, the telco companies in the Philippines were also able to meet the job satisfaction needs and 
preferences of these millennials which resulted to a satisfied millennial workforce in the industry in terms of all the 
examined job satisfaction factors.

7. The managers of the different companies are constantly trained be effective managers at their jobs not only 
technically but also in people management. Their managers undergo management trainings to improve their 
management capabilities and capacities. 
8. Majority of the companies in the telco industry had no work-life balance programs designed towards the needs of 
its millennial employees. Two of the seven interview respondents mentioned they use teambuilding activities as a 
substitute to work-life balance programs and to meet the work-life balance needs of its millennial employees. 
9. Majority of the companies had no strict hiring policies but instead welcome different applicants who had adequate 
work experience in the telco industry. Small to medium sized companies also prefer fresh graduates from the 
universities to give them a hands-on work experience. 
10. The companies currently do not have any retention strategies towards employees who wish to resign from the 
organization. These companies simply support the decision of the millennial employees to have better opportunities 
and be part of bigger organizations. 
 
3.2. Result of One-way ANOVA 
 
One-way ANOVA was used to assess the fit between the means of the millennials and the management in terms of 
the job satisfaction factors. The p-values of the results yielded a p-value of greater than the significant value of 0.05 
indicating that the differences in means are not statistically significant. A post-hoc test was performed to identify any 
differences in the results. The groupings in the post-hoc tests yielded the same grouping since means that do not share 
a letter are significantly different. Therefore, a fit between the millennials and the management is present in terms of 
all the job satisfaction factors.

Abstract 
In recent years, reverse logistics (RL) has received considerable attention due to business and environmental factors. 
The environmental context has driven many organizations to invest in green technologies, with a recent emphasis on 
reducing greenhouse gasses (GHG) emission. This research proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to 
a multi-echelon reverse logistics network design problem with multi-facility while taking account of GHG 
emissions. The proposed model aims at minimizing the total cost of an organization which mainly includes 
production, emission costs, and transportation cost and recovery cost. To consider variations in future in the network 
configuration; we incorporated the dynamic nature of the cost parameters. Since such network design problems are 
NP-hard problems, we proposed an enhanced benders decomposition algorithm to find the near optimal solution. We 
also compare the numerical results through exact solutions solved using IBM ILOG CPLEX 12.5.

Abstract 
 
Handicraft occupation is a strenuous job, often performed in poor work settings. Working in such conditions 
for a long period of time may lead to musculoskeletal pain in different body regions. The study aimed to 
evaluate the prevalence of lower back pain and their associated work-related psychosocial risk factors 
among the male handicraft workers in India. A self-reported questionnaire study was conducted among 286 
male handicraft workers, including gemstone cutters, metalcraft workers, and miniature painters. The lower 
back pain was found to be the most prevalent (75.18%) and severe work-related health problem in this 
occupational group. Work-related psychosocial factors such as high job demand and low job control showed 
a significant association with the development of lower back pain. The findings suggested that despite the 
substantial impact of the physical work with respect to the etiology of musculoskeletal pain, researchers 
should expand their focus to work-related psychosocial issues. Preventive intervention strategies ensuring 
ergonomic workload and flexibility at the workplace of handicraft workers are highly recommended.

1. Introduction 
Handicraft manufacturing is an artistic activity where useful and decorative items are made in a traditional way with 
the hands or by using simple tools, and India has a rich culture and heritage of great art and craftsmanship. In India, 
the tradition of this craftsmanship has been carried down through the generations to the present day. While in different 
countries craft is practiced more as a leisure activity, in India, it is a full-time job and a major source of income for 
the rural communities. Handicraft occupation is the second largest source of income to the rural and semi-urban people 
of India, after agriculture. The handicraft industry in India is highly fragmented, promotes the regional art and 
craftsmanship in the domestic and international market with more than seven million regional artisans and more than 
sixty-seven thousand exporters. The industry plays a significant role in economic growth of the country and employs

Abstract 
Healthcare management is becoming a significant issue in the world scale due to the increasing demand in the 
healthcare section. Many countries endeavor to improve and develop their healthcare system in order to support those 
demands. Thailand is a country that also aims to develop the healthcare system to the world class. Many techniques 
and tools are applied for improving healthcare management in Thailand including IE tools. According to the 
importance of IE tools associated with healthcare management, this study aims to propose a survey of research work 
on the improvement of healthcare management in Thailand based on using IE tools. The survey will examine the 
improvement of healthcare management in Thailand based on IE tool type in the literature review. Moreover, for each 
research, operational level and system level of the healthcare system will be evaluated and then case studies will then 
be presented. Finally, research gaps will be identified and be addressed in further research studies to develop more 
effective healthcare management in Thailand.

1. Introduction
Healthcare management or healthcare administration is the management or administration of healthcare systems, 
public health systems, hospitals, whole hospital networks including other medical facilities. The healthcare 
management aims to ensure that individual sections run smoothly and efficiently, qualified employees are hired, 
information is disseminated efficiently throughout the organization or network, specific outcomes are reached, and 
resources are used efficiently, among many other responsibilities. Recently, the healthcare management has enormous 
demand since it can assist in managing a hospital and related medical facilities. The scope of healthcare management 
system is increasing by each day in the world. The solutions of healthcare management are more than one factor that 
leads to the increasing demand in the healthcare section. The solutions are not only related to management in 
healthcare system but also related to healthcare services, health policies and enhancement in the demand for world-
class healthcare facilities in healthcare management as well. Nowadays, Healthcare management is still undergoing 
from the inefficient operation. Many hospitals and other medical facilities urgently need to improve their processes 
and services. However, redesign projects in healthcare management systems have often been unsuccessful. 
The healthcare management in Thailand is also suffering from inefficient operation including operational level and 
system level. Many researchers aim to focus on this point and try to improve and develop the healthcare management 
system in Thailand. Many tools are proposed to improve several problems in this field such as inventory, material 
flow, information flow, transportation, service management, etc.  Industrial Engineering (IE) tools is a major tool that

5. Conclusions 
 
This study proposed a survey on the improvement of healthcare management in Thailand based on using IE tools. The 
existing studies were reviewed and classified based on IE tool type, operational level, and system level, and case study. 
We found that the main IE tool that the researchers usually employ in the improvement of healthcare management in 
Thailand is a Lean concept. Not only Lean concept but also simulation, inventory control model, and ABC 
classification have been applied in this field as well. In operational level and system level, our literature survey found 
that most researchers published their works on the operation level in Thailand, while the works on the system level 
are few researches. In accordance with the case study of existing studies, most papers aimed to focus on a hospital in 
Thailand, especially public hospital. Also, we found that the drug department and outpatient department are the main 
department of research in Thailand. Finally, research gaps and future research were identified as assisting in 
developing future healthcare management.

Abstract 
When designing a production line, obtaining the maximum number of finished products in a given time is a 
fundamental requirement. To this end, the time interval for feeding materials into a line should be as short as possible. 
When time intervals are shortened, the probability of a collision occurring between materials increases. In a 
manufacturing process, such a collision might result in losses in many areas. For example, financial or time losses 
might be incurred if a manufacturing system shuts down. Moreover, a shutdown might also increase labor costs due 
to the recovery required. Therefore, when designing a manufacturing line, it can be very important to estimate the 
collision probability in the designed line.  
Research already exists on collision probability in a manufacturing model, where an in-line machines model was 
assumed. This study assumes that the processing times of jobs follow an Erlang distribution, and then derives a closed 
form formula for collision probability in a parallel machines model, where the number of jobs is the number of 
machines plus one or two. Following on from this, we discuss whether collision probability in a parallel machines 
model could be described by a closed form expression for any number of jobs.

Abstract 
According to the data collected by World Bank in 2010, one third of the household expense for average income family 
is on food consumption. In the other hand, Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nation (FAO) has been 
published an annual report stated that a large majority of losses in food supply chain consist of two part. The first part 
is the food wastes from disregard products at retail store which link to the customer’s behavior and the replenishment 
policy of the store and the second part is the food losses along the supply chain from producer to retail store such as 
storage, transportation and distribution. Since most of the international food supply chain is dealing with a random 
lifetime perishable product such as fruit, vegetable, and cereal, which have more complexity information to be 
managed by supply chain manager in order to satisfy the stochastic demand and prevent the lost sale while maintain 
the minimum spoilage and maximize the profit of the store. This paper proposes a multi objective optimization model 
for international perishable food supply chain under stochastic demand and fuzzy deterioration rate. The objectives of 
the model are maximizing the profit of retail store and minimizing the total cost by reducing the spoilage product at 
each node in the supply chain.

Abstract 
Supply chain performance evaluation is a critical and difficult task in supply chain management. This paper 
presents a performance evaluation framework to evaluate and compare the performance of different supply 
chains. The framework is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as a data oriented tool for evaluating 
the performance of several supply chains that convert multiple inputs to multiple outputs. The objectives 
of this study are: (a) to construct a set of aggregated indicators that best characterize the performance of 
supply chains (b) to estimate the relative technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of supply chains 
and interpret the results, and finally (c) to estimate the magnitudes of input adjustments that would have 
been required to make each supply chain efficient. The proposed approach is then applied to evaluate real-
life public pharmaceutical products supply chains in Morocco. 
Keywords 
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), performance evaluation framework, supply chain performance. 
1. Introduction
Supply chain performance evaluation is a very complex task the managers should undertake to take appropriate
actions for continuous improvement. According to Mentzer et al. (2001), supply chain management is defined as the 
systemic, strategic coordination of the traditional business functions and the tactics across these business functions 
within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purpose of improving the long-
term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole. Thus an effective and efficient supply 
chain management is an essential foundation for companies to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. In fact, 
competitive advantage was defined by Porter (1985) as the extent to which an organization is able to create a defensible 
position over its competitors. 
     Nelly et al. (1995) consider time, cost, quality and flexibility as the main measures of the performance in 
manufacturing. Beamon (1999) proposes a supply chains performance measurement framework considering three 
essential components to supply chain success which are: resources measures (e.g. manufacturing costs, inventory costs 
etc…), outputs measures (e.g. Sales, profit etc…) and flexibility measures (the system reaction to uncertainty). Indeed,

5.  Conclusion 
     The overarching objectives of this research are to propose a three stage DEA approach to aggregate and evaluate 
the performance of supply chains.  The outcome of this study will assist the supply chains managers in comparing 
their supply chains against peers and dimensioning their resources to achieve a given level of productions. Data 
envelopment analysis is first used to aggregate a set of performance indicators into one composite indicator and then 
to measure the relative technical, pure technical and scale efficiencies of supply chains. Decomposing technical 
efficiency scores into pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency provides guidance on what can be achieved in the 
short and long term. The efficiency scores have been calculated under Constant Return to Scale (CRS) and Variable 
Return to Scale (VRS) with an input orientation which aims to reduce the amount of inputs for a given level of outputs. 
However, the proposed approach has a serious limitation as it produces the aggregated inputs targets and doesn’t allow 
the derivation of the original inputs targets. Thus, the process of decision making is difficult as managers can’t directly 
act on the aggregated indicators. Hence future researches are needed to overcome this shortcoming.

Sustainable Biodegradable Packaging Material: 
A Solution for Decreasing Available Capacity

Abstract 
Plastic packaging material plays a vital role in people’s daily lives, and it is a fact that most of which are petroleum-
based like the one being used in the Philippines. This type of plastic is very strong, less brittle, but non-biodegradable 
that would take hundreds of years before it decays, which in turn decreases the available capacity of sanitary landfills. 
If this scenario continued, many of the sanitary landfills in the Philippines will be forced to close as what the others 
have already been into. Due to this concern, this research would introduce the use of a sustainable biodegradable 
packaging material which can be a substitute to the petroleum-based plastics. This research will identify various 
alternatives and choose among these alternatives through the application of multi-criteria decision making with 
consideration of valuable criteria in selecting a packaging material. The chosen alternative will then be subjected for 
demand and supply analysis to check the readiness of the Philippines for the use of the chosen sustainable 
biodegradable packaging material, and check its eventual impact to the capacity of sanitary landfills.

Abstract 
Through this paper, an attempt has been made to understand the impact of technological change in terms 
of product improvement, durability, and reliability, which are in turn affected by firm’s marketing 
strategy under competition and its conflict with operations strategy. In order to survive in a competitive 
environment firms need to keep innovating. However, the continuous cycle of frequent improvement 
may require a flexible operations strategy, which would increase input costs. Understanding this conflict 
of making operations flexible, products durable, reliable and competitive, as demanded by the marketing 
strategy, while keeping the cost low and PLC longer, is the aim of this research work.

1. Introduction
Over the years, rapid technological advancement and cut throat competition, while leading to increased variety within 
the product line, has not necessarily led to increased profitability or market share (Ramdas, 2003). Additionally, this 
has led towards shortening product-life-cycle and wider customer demands (Bernardes & Hanna, 2009; Danneels, 
2002). Therefore, product development needs to be innovative, quality oriented and low cost, as well as providing 
optimal value to the customers (Anderson & Joglekar, 2005). As a result, in order to achieve product competitiveness 
through quality, cost and optimal value, firms have started innovation of various typologies. Garcia & Calantone 
(2002) identify these as Newness Factor and observed that the most common typology for product innovativeness 
categorization is High/Medium/Low and Radical Breakthrough/Significant/Incremental technological change. In 
order to understand the impact of product innovation on an existing setup, this paper considers product innovation 
within the context of incremental technological change. The idea is to understand the impact in a continuum where 
the existing plant or the assembly line or the process are subjected to change because of innovation and hence, the 
flexibility of the plant needs to be looked into. Such an effort of developing a model is also stated as “Socially Optimal 
Cost-reducing R&D with Product Durability” (Goel, 2000). These models have been either studied through the 
marketing strategy perspective i.e. from the point of view of price, advertising, competition, timing between product 
introduction and modes of advertising such as word-of-mouth etc. (Easingwood, et al., 1983; Mahajan et al., 1990). 
The product advertising, cost or R&D, its impact on price and durability has been also studied through demand curves 
(Goel, 2007). The impact of improved product quality on durability and frequency of replacement of one version of 
the product by the newer version has also been studied through durability and recyclability (Geyer et al., 2007; van 
Nes & Cramer, 2005). However, the improvement in the product in terms of operational parameters like reliability 
and durability and the required process flexibility alongside marketing parameters like advertising, price, competition, 
product introduction frequency, which are implications of product innovation, have not been studied together in a 
consolidated manner.  
The current paper intend to discuss the various approaches used for product innovation. Furthermore, the paper uses 
the Bass Model and Product Life Cycle (PLC) analysis to discuss the product innovation and its absorption in the

8. Conclusion 
The value of equation (xxii) will impact the value of h(t) (equations (xi) and (xii)) Additionally, since S(t) is 
directly proportional to E(t) (equation (iv)) and E(t) and E(t-1) are inversely related to pt which is directly 
related to profit and RD1 and RD0  (refer equation (x)),  we can assume that there is an optimal mix of frequency 
of technological change – significant and incremental, in product innovation, production cost, durability of the 
product, flexibility of the operations strategy towards product innovation, cost of R&D, marketing and similar 
other variable.  The construct for the same has been shown in Fig. 4.

The function (xxiii) along with the construct can provide what is the optimal level of profit for a certain firm at 
certain level of innovation for a certain kind of product category. A longitudinal study of an organization may 
provide the direction in which the organization should move in terms of technology management, and will reduce 
the conflict between marketing strategy and operations strategy. Some of the additional variables for future scope 
of research could be the number of innovations per year within the same product line, average no. of years spent 
with the customer (actual user life) vis a vis average number of years as per the product design (durability, designed 
life from bath tub curve), effect of the eco-system for the product (network effect), cost of flexible operations 
management (Plant life and designed for number of new product introduction per year) and profit per product, to 
name a few.

Abstract 
Sugarcane is a major Philippine crop. It is also accounted for the 2nd biggest farm area under food crops. Despite the 
large plantation area, there is a decreasing trend of production of sugarcane in the past few years, both in quantity and 
quality. One of the reasons is the accumulated decreased productivity of small – sized farm. To address the decrease 
in sugarcane production, this research aims to (1) provide combination of the best Philippine sugarcane varieties using 
compromise programming. Flowering, millable stalks, yield potential (LKg/Ha), and reaction to diseases such as 
downy mildew, smut, yellow spot, and leaf scorch were used as criteria, and (2) recommend cultivation practices 
based on the chosen varieties to produce more high yield sugarcane for small – size farm in the Philippines. The results 
show that the five best sugarcane varieties for the current conditions stated are Phil 93-1601, Phil 94-0913, Phil 92-
0577, Phil 92-0051, and Phil 99-1793. The best combination of sugarcane varieties and cultivation practices are also 
listed.

1. Introduction
Sugarcane is a perennial plant that grows well in tropical and in subtropical climate (Department of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries, 2012). It undergoes different processes to produce sugar, molasses, and fertilizer. In the 
Philippines, sugarcane accounted for the 2nd biggest farms under food crops (Quilang, 2011). The plantation area of 
sugarcane in the CY 2014 – 2015 and CY 2015 – 2016 decreased from 423, 333 hectares to 416,893 hectares and 413, 
264 hectares respectively. Meanwhile, in the CY 2016 – 2017, there is an increase in the plantation area to 421, 358 
hectares. However, in the recent statistics of Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) (2018) on the Performance of 
Philippine Agriculture from January – March 2018, the gross earnings from sugarcane declines by 21.77% due to drop 
volume of production by 11.56% and lower price by 11.55%. 
The sizes of Philippine sugarcane farms show a large portion of small- sized farms or farms with plantation area below 
five hectares (Sugar Regulatory Administration, n.d.). This has led to the accumulated decreased production of 
sugarcane (Sy, n.d.). In order to increase the production of sugarcane in the Philippines, the researchers aim to provide 
a combination of best Philippine sugarcane varieties and recommend cultivation practices on growth stages of 
sugarcane for small- sized sugarcane farms.

Abstract 
Nowadays, in spite of advanced communication technology, the post box collection activity is still 
operating by the agents of a country's postal service. Thus, this activity needs to be operated at minimum 
cost with smart decision making. The aim of this study is to find the optimal routing in post box collection 
activity with an objective to minimize the total traveling time. To deal with large-scale problem in the real-
world practice, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm are applied to solve the complexity of the 
problem. The experiments are executed using the case study of post box collection in Chiang Mai city, 
Thailand. The results showed that the proposed PSO can effectively find the new routing which helps to 
reduce the total travelling time by 11.14%, the total travelling distance by 7.11%, and the total cost by 
13.86%.

1. Introduction
In the world toward industry 4.0 and advance communication technology, the postal service receives drastic 
popularity especially on parcel collection and delivery.  Even though much less number of people using post box for 
letter dropping, post box collection service is still operating in several countries. Thus, post box collection activity 
must be operated at minimum cost with smart decision making using high-technology computing techniques. Post box 
collection routing problem is one of the postal service problems that has been studied for several decades. The goal of 
the problem is to find the optimal routing to satisfy some certain objectives.  
The post box collection routing problem is a kind of the generalized vehicle routing problem (GVRP). The 
GVRP, introduced by Ghiani and Improta (2000), is an extension of the vehicle routing problem (VRP). The GVRP 
is the problem of designing optimal delivery or collection routes from a given depot to a number of predefined, 
mutually exclusive and exhaustive node-sets (clusters) which includes exactly one node from each cluster, subject to 
capacity restrictions. Several solution methods for GVRP include exact algorithms and approximate algorithms, such 
as Kara and Bektas (2003) and Pop et al. (2009, 2010). Pop et al. (2012) proposed the two new modes of GVRP based 
on integer programming to reduce the complexity of the problem. The results showed the efficiency of the proposed 
models.

5. Conclusion 
 
The aim of this work is to find optimal routing in post box collection activity in Chiang Mai city, Thailand, 
with an objective to minimize the total traveling time.  
While the exact method cannot provide solution in a reasonable time, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is 
implemented to handling the complexity of the real-world problem. To solve the problem, the encoding and decoding 
procedures are developed for transform a particle solution into the routing of post box collection activity. Furthermore, 
several swap strategies are proposed to improve the solution quality. The experimental results show that the proposed 
PSO can effectively find the new post box collection routing which helps to reduce the total travelling time, the total 
travelling distance, and the total cost. In conclusion, the proposed PSO algorithm can be used as a smart decision 
making tool to solve similar vehicle routing problems.

Abstract 
Information spreads on complex social networks extremely fast. A piece of information can go viral in no time and 
can be harmful. Often it is hard to stop this information spread causing social unrest. An intentional spread of software 
vulnerabilities in GitHub has caused millions of dollars in losses. GitHub is a social coding platform that enables a 
huge number of open source software projects to thrive. To better understand how the information spreads on GitHub, 
we develop a deep neural network model: “DeepFork”, a supervised machine learning based approach that aims to 
predict information diffusion; considering node as well as topological features in complex social networks. In our 
empirical studies, we observed that information diffusion can be detected by link prediction using supervised learning. 
This model investigates the followee-follower influence that underlay information dynamics in social coding platform. 
DeepFork outperforms other machine learning models as it better learns the discriminative patterns from the input 
features. DeepFork helps us in understand human influence on information spread and evolution.

1. Introduction
Traffic on social networking sites had drastically increased in the recent past, GitHub is akin. GitHub is a popular 
online code hosting service that provides an open development environment and visibility of project activity to 
subscribers by maintaining transparency and collaboration in software development activities (Kalliamvakou et al. 
2015), (Dabbish et al. 2012). Crowd-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) allows anyone with domain knowledge to 
participate in software development tasks: designing, programming, testing, deploying and documenting, widely of 
late (Cosentino et al. 2017). Before we delve into the topic, we define the terminology used in GitHub; Repository: 
A folder space to place all project related files, along with the revision history backlogs for the files. These are 
containers of information (code). User: An owner of the repository; a valid contributor who has commit permission 
to the main repository. Fork: a copy of a repository; this event allows users to experiment with their copy, without 
affecting the original repository. Watch: Watch enables users to get notified about every change that happens to a 
repository such as commits, issues, and reports. Information diffusion does happen among assorted users and 
repositories in GitHub, and this pervasive phenomenon is of interest to those who study complex social networks, 
although the concept of diffusion of information is borrowed from other fields: epidemiology and economics. Despite 
of continuous on-going research on workflow analysis of GitHub, there is no concrete model to depict how and why 
human influence on information propagation happen. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has 
solicited innovative research in the area of computational simulation of the spread and evolution of information in the 
online environment, this project a.k.a “Computational Simulation of Online Social Behavior (SocialSim)”. In the 
developmental phase of an innovative technology for high-fidelity computational simulation, we first should 
understand the difference between online communications on traditional social media platforms to social coding 
platform. We narrowed down our research path to information flow in network structure by the following questions.  
RQ 1: How does information spread over time in complex social coding environment?  
RQ 2: Given a bipartite network of users and repositories, how can the diffused information evolve? 
RQ 3: What is the influence of the actions performed by some users on their peers? 
We attempt to answer these questions, by posing the scenario as a link (information diffusion) prediction problem on 
network structure, which is casted as a binary classification task. GitHub data is used in this work, where we consider

Abstract 
This paper presents the process of implementation Operational Excellence (OE) in companies that have achieved a 
competitive advantage, through the application of Critical Success Factors (CSF). With this in mind, the elements that 
make up this concept are defined and have been obtained from a set of 122 articles from 2005 through 2018 and are 
presented by different authors that applied similar concepts. The articles were selected using a series of keywords in 
the databases that appear in Scopus, ProQuest, Emerald, Science Direct and Web of Science and filtered in a population 
analysis, which we will see more in detail in the literature review. Also, the CSF that influence the application of OE 
were analyzed in this compendium. The study also includes an analysis and a development already carried out, that 
has been successfully implemented, where the steps to be followed for their execution are identified. These CSF are 
visualized from a Lean perspective, were we propose a type of execution. Likewise, the critical success factors of Six 
Sigma are reviewed for comparison. Subsequently, a description of the operation of these critical factors of Lean and 
Six Sigma are made, proposing a different perspective of OE. 
Keywords 
Critical Success Factors, Operational Excellence, Lean Six Sigma, Productivity. 
1. Introduction
According to Dora et al. (2013), the skill of the workforce, in-house expertise and the organizational culture are critical 
factors for a successful implementation of lean manufacturing practices and essential elements for an organization to 
achieve a competitive advantage, so they can control processes and actions to achieve organizational objectives. 
Likewise, Resende et al. (2018) conducted a study where they assimilated the collaboration and its main factors of 
interrelation between the organizations that are part of the cooperation and competition network. In addition, they 
analyzed the critical success factors related to business cooperation and the structure for its recognition. Part of its 
competitive advantage focuses on the main strategic factors that induce competitors to cooperate, as well as on the 
interactions between cooperation and competition. Thus, CSF are limited to key variables or conditions that have an 
impact on how an organization meets successfully and effectively. In a study related to food processing in SMEs by 
Dora et al. (2013), they applied and identified operational excellence to define the critical success factors and thus be 
able to help companies and professionals to focus on the quality improvement methods, as well as lean manufacturing 
to increase production efficiency. The scope of our research is to be able to define the critical success factors that have 
the greatest impact on organizations, in order to be able to sustain the best practices and a continuous improvement 
culture. 
2. Literature Review
During the research, articles were consulted in different databases like Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, Emerald 
and Science Direct to learn more about the concepts and applications of the different CSF in organizations. The 
explorations of these articles were through keywords or critical elements, such as the following: ""operational 
excellence"", ""performance excellence"", ""operations excellence"", ""business excellence"", ""Enterprise excellence"", ""lean 
six sigma"", ""Continuous improvement"", among others. In these articles, CSF were found in successful and failed 
implementations, we reviewed the context and the implementation method that they carried out. Likewise, we collected 
all the information obtained from this investigation, including the title, author, reference, year, source, complete text,

Abstract 
In this study, we discuss the possibility of conducting a trip survey using a smartphone. The Person 
Trip Survey obtains the most basic transportation data between an origin and destination in an urban area. 
In particular, the survey is conducted once every five years in Japan. Many countries spend a large 
amount of money to conduct such a survey because it is a questionnaire survey.  It is used for area 
marketing, in addition to transportation planning. 
At the present time, various types of sensor are available in daily life with the spread of smartphones 
and wearable devices. In particular, smartphones have the Global Positioning System, in addition to an 
acceleration sensor and camera. Many people move somewhere carrying their smartphones. If we use 
smartphones as a survey device, then we can collect trip data inexpensively and accurately using the 
aforementioned functions. 
In this paper, we develop a classification system for a transport mode on a smartphone. The function 
is based on deep machine learning in a neural network. We measure the traffic mode and three-axis 
acceleration using a smartphone and make our neural network learn them.  Based on the performance, we 
discuss the possibility of classifying the trip mode. 
Keywords

Abstract 
We propose a routing model suited for freight transportation by mid- and large-size trucks. A digital road 
network data that includes non-arterial roads is used. Passenger vehicles and lightweight trucks often run on non-
arterial roads, because in many cases their destinations are residential districts. Moreover, mid- and large-size trucks 
frequently work for deliveries from a factory to distribution stations. These stations are often located beside an 
arterial road. The latter type of transportation would cause air pollution, because trucks often idle on a street to wait 
for their scheduled time. To address this issue, we first reveal features of routing policy of mid- and large-size trucks. 
Then, we solve a routing problem in which a penalty for left- and right-turns is taken into account. The penalty has 
the same characteristics as that of the route selection of mid- and large-size trucks. Further, we implement a 
procedure for solving the constructed problem to work on a geographical information system. A simulation is 
conducted using a network data of both arterial and non-arterial roads in Tokyo, Japan. Numerical results 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract 
We develop an assessment system regarding accessibility to a facility, which runs on a geographic 
information system. The system takes into account contribution by public transportation systems. With this system, 
we can analyze the locations of grocery stores along with accessibility. A food desert problem is addressed and the 
efficiency of the resulting solution is confirmed. With respect to food desert problems, the existing studies assess 
accessibility of grocery stores only with walking distance or time measure. However, in most districts in Japan, a 
bus transportation system is available to reach destination. In particular, many elderly people have physical limits, 
thereby those living in depopulated area play a central role in the problem. To make a proper assessment for food 
deserts, it is necessary to take into account contribution of local transportation systems, as well as the traditional 
walk-based measure. In this study, we calculate two time measures, one is walking distance and the other is time 
distance by walking and bus transportation on GIS. We implement our method for QGIS, then a validation is made. 
Focusing on a suburban area of Tokyo, we demonstrate an influence on the proximity measure considering the effect 
of bus transportation.

Abstract 
Traffic accidents have been very costly to individuals and societies over long decades, motor vehicle collision may 
cause serious injuries or even deaths to drivers, passengers, or pedestrians. Vehicle collision also causes car and 
property damage. However, there are some factors, which contribute more to the risk of car accidents that includes 
the vehicle itself, speeding, road conditions, and driver skills and behavior. In this work, a factor effect study using 
design of experiment tools has been performed to study the effect of some factors on the severity of car accidents in 
a city in the Gulf area over a year. Actual data was gathered and statistically analyzed, the factors considered in this 
study were basically; speeding, driver's skills and attention during driving, and driving under alcoholic condition 
besides studying the effect of using seatbelts on accident’s severity level. The effect of the main factors and the 
factor interaction was analyzed. The study has revealed that 80% of the accidents were caused by low attention and 
poor skills of drivers; it was also found that fastening seatbelts was very effective in reducing medium-severity 
accidents.

Introduction 
Car accidents have been increasingly bringing worries to societies because of their economic and social impact, 
which could be disastrous in some instances. Car accident is a daily practice on most road and highways worldwide 
that affects safety level on such highways and represents a challenge for governments. Developed and developing 
countries are both suffering from such life-threatening problem with developing countries being the most affected by 
this problem especially as related to the increasing number of fatalities,  Esmael (2013). 
Car accidents are becoming a major contributor to human deaths, injuries, and property damage resulting in huge 
losses in lives, economy, and quality of life, Toroyan and Peden (2007) and Peden et al. (2004). Causes of car 
accidents are numerous. However, they are mainly grouped into three categories: human, vehicle and environment. 
The accident can result from a single factor of the previously mentioned factors or a combination of these factors. 
Studies, AUSTROADS (1994) and Treat et al. (1979) showed that human (as a single factor or in combination with 
other factors) is responsible in the first place for accidents occurrence. 
Road accidents can result from a wide spectrum of causes such as negligence and speed, Al-masaeid (2009). Taking 
speeding as an example; Mclean and Kloeden (2002) have shown that driving by 5 km/hr above 60 km/hr would

The results of this study indicate that low and moderate severity accidents composing approximately 80% of total 
accidents, are related to driver's skills and attention. The vast majority of them were caused by the weak skills and 
attention of drivers. It was also found that accidents caused by driving under alcoholic conditions are not as 
important as driver’s attention or speed because the study was conducted in a country that prohibits alcoholic drinks 
from religion point of view. 
 
Conclusion 
In this study, accident data were analyzed to understand the effect of some factors on the severity level of the 
accident as a part of the accident risk management process. Driver’s skills and attention, speeding, and driving under 
alcoholic conditions were considered in this study and the effect of the status of the seatbelt on the severity level was 
investigated. The majority (about 80%) of the moderate and low severe accidents were caused by the driver’s skills 
and attention. It was also found that the number of accidents resulting from some factors is affected by the levels of 
the other factors. For catastrophic accidents, the number of accidents observed over a year was not affected by the 
status of the seatbelt. Therefore, awareness campaigns are very helpful in urging drivers to pay more attention 
during driving.

Advanced preservation policy for deteriorating products 
during transportation and at retailer within a supply chain

Abstract 
This paper contains a two-echelon supply chain model for deteriorating products considering advanced preservation 
policy during transportation and at retailer. The recent innovations regarding preservation of food products include 
several types of preservation technologies to reduce the deterioration rate. Use of such technologies increases the 
supply chain profit of such fixed lifetime products. Unlike other studies, who proposed continuous reduction in rates 
of deterioration with investment in preservation technology, we focus on more real circumstances by proposing model 
of such a preservation policy that minimizes the effects of deterioration in a way that magnitude of decrease in 
deterioration reduces for additional investment in preservation technology. The model is validated with numerical 
experiment by considering a case study on fresh fruits. Implication of investment in preservation technology is 
illustrated by evaluating increase in product’s life time and profit which authenticates the proposed model.

1. Background and motivation
Food products deteriorate during transportation and at retailers, which causes decrease in their sale and profit. Due to 
deterioration, quality of the food products is either reduced or these products become perishable after a certain period 
of time, thus making them unfit for human consumption. At retail stores, such food products, which deteriorated during 
transportation or at retailer are usually discarded, which merely incur the production, transportation and inventory 
costs. Such disposals not only create an economic loss but also affect the environment and natural resources. In the 
United States, approximately 15% of the food products expire due to deterioration before reaching their consumers. It 
is reported that, throughout the world, 1.3 billion tons of food products are discarded every year, which is 
approximately 33% of all the food produced for human consumption (Gustavsson et al., 2011). This study is focused 
to minimize these losses by providing preservation policies for food products during their transportation and storage. 
Deterioration has been discussed in literature by many researchers. First model for deteriorating inventory was 
proposed by Ghare and Schrader (1963). Sachan (1984) developed an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model with 
shortages and time dependent product demand where inventory items deteriorate at a constant rate. Chang and Dye 
(1999) improved the model by considering backlogged shortages. This research dimension was further explored by 
Skouri et al. (2009) and they proposed an inventory model with time dependent rate of deterioration and ramp type 
demand rate considering partial backlogging. Sarkar (2013) proposed an Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) model 
considering three probabilistic (uniform, triangular, beta) deterioration rates to find the optimum lot size and number 
of deliveries. Chen and Teng (2014) developed an EOQ model with deteriorating items having maximum life time 
and permissible delay in payments to minimize the total cost. Goel et al. (2015) considered variable quadratic rate of 
deterioration in a deterministic inventory model and they proposed a supply chain model considering supplier, 
manufacturer and a retailer with stock dependent demand and partial backlogging. Sarkar et al. (2015) studied a two 
echelon supply chain system focusing on setup cost, system reliability and deterioration. They concluded that setup 
cost is directly and deterioration rate is inversely proportional to the system reliability. Lin et al. (2016) studied an 
inventory system considering deterioration that depends on life time and the product price is demand dependent. 
Solution of the deterioration is provided with preservation technology (PT). Deterioration can be controlled either by 
adding preservatives to the product which stops or modifies the chemical reactions which cause deterioration or by 
controlling those ambient conditions which cause initiate or accelerate the deterioration. For the last decade, many

Comparative analysis of optimal results with and without application of PT shows that the application of PT increases 
lifetime of the product and total profit per unit time of the proposed supply chain system, while the rate of deterioration 
is reduced. 
 
5. Concluding remarks 
 
This paper discussed a supply chain system in which preservation technology is used to increase life time of short life 
deteriorating products and proposed a model to find optimal value of investment in preservation technology during 
transportation and at retailer. The proposed model suggested that lifetime of a deteriorating product is increased 
significantly by applying preservation technology and consequently the rate of deterioration is decreased. The authors 
also recommended that product having longer time to expire is sold at higher price and it contributes to increase the 
profit. The hypothesis was verified through the results of numerical illustrations that demonstrated a remarkable 
increase in profit of the supply chain when the proposed preservation policy was adopted. Moreover, it was proved 
that the investment for preservation conditions as well as cold storage during transportation is significant. This research 
can further be continued to study the effects of preservation technology on maximum lifetime of the product. Moreover, 
several storage conditions during transportation of food products can be investigated.

operational efficiency and create value in their business. Technology was used in the industry to increase opportunities 
and productivity as well as reducing costs, reduce resources and costs. As a result, today's technology is progressing 
and contributing to more efficient use. Technology is the key component to applying and helps to improve the 
production. That from the past of industrial revolution, the first invention introduced mechanical engineering to 
replace human labor. Watt's steam engine was used in the fabrication of the Textile Industry which are the main 
industry and expanded to other industries. The second industrial revolution are become the use of conveyor belts for 
mass production systems and economies of scale. The third industrial as known as industrial era. It is the electronic 
and computer system, IT system and automation. (Ahmad et al .2017). In the next future, the world is about to enter 
the industrial era of the fourth industry revolution which is the introduction of Automation technology to work with 
the Internet to integrate work with robots or Cyber to Cyber  or Cyber-Physical System. (A.C. Pereira 2017)

Employee skill sets, Product customization, Leadership, Automation, Autonomous processes, Skill acquisition, 
Collaboration  network, respectively. 
 
The limitation of this research is a many the dimension supported on the production manufacturing. It has a some of 
the dimension to support the other kinds of the industry. For the organization does not select the optimal dimension 
in their business because the result of the model shows only the status of the organization. 
 
In the future research will added more of the dimension and sub-dimension to support the other kind of the industry 
sector and the result can show the optimal dimension and sub-dimension to implantation in each organization.

Abstract 
In this paper, a new approach is presented to identify customers churn in the banking industry. The purpose of this 
study is to increase the accuracy of customer churn identification. In order to predict it, the neural network methods 
of multilayer perceptron, radial basis function, support vector machine, and generalized regression are used. Then, the 
accuracy is increased by using a Naïve Bayes as a meta-classifier. The results show that this approach has led to a 
significant improvement in the prediction of customers churn. In addition, we figured out that if classifier techniques 
can achieve good results, the meta-classifier will boost the accuracy considerably.

1. Introduction and Literature Review
A customer churn is someone who stop using a products or services of organization and use the products and services 
of other competitors. 
Many researches have been done on the importance and necessity of predicting customer behavior, and their churn in 
particular. For example:  
•
The research (Chu et al., 2007) states that the cost of absorbing a new customer is 5 to 10 times more than
keeping the older ones.

4. CONCLUSION 
Nowadays, Customer Relationship Management is one of the most important managerial concepts. The core of CRM 
is customer churn, and customer retention. Using data mining it is possible to recognize the hidden patterns of the 
data. The customer churn, also prediction the leaving customers pose huge amount of cost on the organization. In this 
research a new approach is presented to analyze the customer churn in Iranian bank. To form a more precise model, a 
meta-classifier method was suggested. And the results indicate the NB as a meta-classifier has well performance 
compared to MLP, SVM, RBF and GRNN in making the customer churn prediction.

Abstract 
In this paper, productivity and the effective factors are determined in the Iranian construction industry over the period 
2006-2012 by the DEA-based Malmquist indices. Moreover, the explanatory factors affecting productivity levels are 
determined using truncated regression method. The results show that the average of productivity levels has 
significantly decreased. Although sanction has had significant negative correlations with technology change and 
productivity change, it did not have an effect on efficiency change. Furthermore, it was observed that the economic 
recession only had a negative correlation with technology change. It was witnessed that construction companies suffer 
numerous issues in productivity and lesser flexibility in the execution of projects as they grow in size. It also was 
concluded that companies located in the capital have more potential to improve their productivity due to easier access 
to technological advancement.
