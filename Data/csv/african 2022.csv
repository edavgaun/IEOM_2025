Abstract 
 
The aim of this article is to describe which digital marketing strategies are applied to promote the e-commerce of 
SMEs in the cosmetics sector in Peru. It presents a quantitative approach and a descriptive design. The instrument 
used was an adapted 11-item questionnaire, non-probabilistic convenience sampling was used and it was applied to a 
sample of 14 importing SMEs in the sector. The results obtained were analysed using tables and figures based on 
descriptive and inferential statistics, which showed, through the dimensions, that social networks are one of the main 
strategies applied by SMEs (71.4%), followed by email marketing (57.1%), mobile marketing (50%), and finally, 
SEM (21.4%). In conclusion, it was possible to identify the most used strategies in the e-commerce of some SMEs, 
which allows them to have online presence and trust in customers; however, it is important to take into account the 
sector to which the company is directed for its correct application. Therefore, this study contributes to know which 
strategies are used by SMEs for the development of e-commerce in the cosmetics sector.

1. Introduction  
The internet has evolved the exchange of goods and services between seller and buyer, which has turned e-
commerce into a reliable alternative for companies to grow in business. In this way, e-commerce is the process by 
which commercial transactions are carried out through digital platforms such as a website and social networks that

1",,"In terms of limitations, access to a network of direct contact with the companies that were part of the sample reduced 
the possibility of being able to expand the results. Language was also a limitation in terms of finding articles related 
to the topic, as there were some articles in other languages such as German and Romanian that could not be 
considered. 
 
The implications of the present research are related to the theoretical aspect because it allows to expand the 
information that is already known about digital marketing strategies. This allows us to show new findings to those 
already found in various articles. It is also a contribution for future research as it shows a different context in terms 
of the importance of digital media during the covid-19 pandemic. On the other hand, on the practical side, it was 
found that the research provides more information on the management of digital marketing strategies in the 
cosmetics sector. 
 
Therefore, digital marketing strategies and their correct management can help SMEs to strengthen and promote their 
e-commerce. However, they depend on the sector and target audience the company is targeting, as it has been 
observed that there are some discrepancies with previous studies.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays, service management and service time are essential in health services. For this reason, a systematic 
review of the literature was carried out to find out about studies dealing with service management and service 
time in SMEs in the health sector over the last 10 years. The databases used were Science Direct, EBSCO host, 
Proquest and Google Student where 40 articles were selected, which show that service management is an 
efficient method for improving services in SMEs in the health sector. Finally, it is concluded that every 
organization always seeks continuous improvement of its processes, the benefit is long term, and the first thing 
is to identify those processes that do not generate value to their activities and this will be achieved through the 
application of management tools for cost reduction, reductions in inequities, increased quality and efficiency in 
patient care within health facilities.

1. Introduction 
The World Health Organisation states that everyone should receive medical, surgical and psychiatric care in the 
different health services, whether in public or private facilities. Health is a right for all, and it is the state that 
must guarantee universal and equal access for the entire population.  
 
Given that healthcare provision is a service that has a social impact, any effort to improve the quality of its 
services can be considered fundamental (Mendonça and Castro 2021). This leads SMEs in the health sector to 
seek improvements in their processes from patient admission to care. However, it has been demonstrated that

Abstract  
 
This research will seek to relate two variables: The impact of social media marketing and the consumer's purchase 
decision, delimiting the target population as the people of Metropolitan Lima. 384 surveys will be conducted as a 
sample; these should consider fast food consumers through social networks. The data collected through surveys 
were processed and analyzed using SPSS so as the reliability and validity of the data which was also reviewed. 
Based on the results, it was observed that there is a correlation between the components of the purchase decision 
(intensity, intention, and frequency) and a marketing strategy, as supported by the numbers. The results of this 
research can be used by different people/entities related to the sector, to understand how a good marketing strategy 
will impact the purchase decision of the fast-food consumer.

1. Introduction  
Over the last few years, the trend to implement digital strategies, as well as marketing plans using mobile 
applications has been increasing more and more frequently. On the other hand, during the last year, the pandemic 
caused by COVID-19 has reinforced this trend, as the focus of companies, known as consumers, increase their 
percentage of use of online channels, and within these social networks. In addition, many companies, especially 
those in the food industry, have been forced to implement plans to connect with consumers through online channels, 
specifically social networks. This is due to several factors, among them are mandatory quarantine, risk of contagion 
by the consumer, practicality, reduced on-site capacity, etc. That is why, through this research, we sought to analyze 
how social media marketing influences the purchase decision of consumers of fast-food restaurants. 
 
Currently, there is a great increase in the use of social networks, not only as a means of information but also as a 
sales channel. In the current situation, due to the pandemic, social networks have transformed their platforms in a 
way that offers different companies a more direct B2C chain with the consumer. With this, you can reach the 
customer more directly and effectively by selling any product you want, including fast food (Moore et al. 2015).  
 
According to Linares and Pozzo (2018), developing a social media marketing strategy facilitates the identification of 
customer profiles, their preferences, and the way they perceive certain products, allowing the consumer to have 
confidence in the producer and a good shopping experience. In addition, social networks allow to have more direct 
contact between the seller and customer (Real et. Al. 2018), this is extremely important for fast-food restaurants 
since they manage to obtain a greater reach and give a good experience both in consumption and in the purchase of 
the product. If we talk about the increase in the use of social networks in Peru, there are more and more 
entrepreneurs who use the media so that their sales have a greater reach and even more so during the pandemic. 
According to a study conducted by IPSOS (Institut de Publique Sondage d'Opinion Secteur), Peru ranks third in the 
index of entrepreneurship and until the pandemic, 59% of Peruvians have made at least 1 venture or more. Finally, 
according to Bedoya, using Social Commerce it is possible to build customer loyalty without incurring very high 
costs and forging a more direct relationship between both parties.

21","warehouses. This trend has been driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as people are more tempted to shop virtually, 
avoiding unnecessary contacts to which they are exposed when they go out to make such purchases. According to 
the eCommerce news blog eCommerce view, the online shopping sector is the fastest-growing sector in the last year. 
According to the blog, ""Before the pandemic, 1.5% (65,800) of businesses sold through the eCommerce channel in 
Peru. After COVID-19, the number of companies that entered e-commerce quadrupled, and by the end of 2020, 5% 
(more than 260,000) already sell online. Likewise, the fast-food sector has benefited from this phenomenon, 
growing 20% with an average ticket of S/. 50. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, it can be affirmed that both variables had a direct and strong correlation. In addition, the importance 
of social media marketing could be evidenced, considering that a good campaign and all its dimensions directly 
impact the consumer's final purchase decision. This was reflected in the survey results that defined such correlation 
in addition to the results that indicated that people preferred online sales channels, promotions and using easy social 
networks. Therefore, it is believed that this will be a future sales method and the new trend to follow.

Abstract 
 
The purpose for which an organisation is established usually determines how the organisation will be set up in terms 
of office space, plant requirement and layout (if any), organisation structure, management philosophy to mention a 
few. This research was carried out to apply established quantitative methods to the redesign and optimisation of the 
organisation structure of a steam power plant. This is in dissonance with usual empirical strategies that were 
deployed in the past. The existing organisation structure was examined in light of the work content. This was used to 
estimate the number of operation level personnel (N0) and the human dynamic interactions rate (λ, μ). These 
estimates were then used to solve and maximise the personnel utilisation objective function (H). It was a non-linear 
constraint maximisation problem. The organisation’s operating labour man-hours was found to be 98285.149 and 
the operation level personnel (N0) was found to be 135 persons supervised and managed by 14 and 5 persons 
respectively.  After optimisation, the redesigned organisation structure had a personnel utilisation of 97.91% and a 
personnel cost saving of 49.6% which led to the conclusion that the redesigned structure outperformed the existing 
structure.

1. Introduction 
Organisational structure exists in various forms across various industries. Charles-Owaba (2002) describes it as the 
acceptable working relationship of employees towards the achievement of the primary goal of the establishment. 
The level of productivity of production firms is heavily dependent on applied exact science such as; operations 
design, process design, facility design among others. However, until recently, little attention has been given to the 
use of quantitative methods to analyse the exact number of workers required to successfully run an organisation. The 
irony of this is that the design of organisational structures has been studied scholastically for over 100 years with 
few scholars taking the study to a quantitative level. 
 
This research builds on the works completed by Charles-owaba (2002) and Hax and Majiluf (1981) in making a case 
and establishing a quantitative method for the design of the organisational structure of a company using the 
operation research paradigm. Akindele (2019) and Ini (2019) have tested this method by successfully optimising the 
organisational structure of a hospital and a manufacturing plant respectively. 
 
1.1 Statement of the Problem 
The ownership of steam power was recently transferred from the government sector to private hands as part of 
efforts by the government to revitalise the power industry. While there is an emphasis on productivity, there is also a

30","The data gathered from the work analysis exercise revealed that certain activities have far more redundancies 
factored into them than is expected for personnel whose performance rating is 100% or more. While some job roles 
remained, there was a need to reorganise in order to have an efficient system. 
The span of control at the second and third levels of the existing organisation structure compares more favourably 
with the optimised organisation structure, but the optimised structure rendered the third decision level unnecessary. 
The proposed organisation structure when compared with the existing structure makes performance measurement 
and human dynamic interaction easier as it eliminates the one subordinate to two bosses reporting lines that were 
found in the existing organisation structure. Financially, the optimised organisation structure proved to be very cost-
effective as the funds required to pay the wages of personnel for a month in the existing structure will now pay for 
almost two months after trimming down to the optimal structure. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Personnel utilisation mathematical expression was formulated in terms of organisation design variables and 
parameters and applied as a design objective function. This confirmed the practicality of applying the quantitative 
approach to solving the organisation design problem. 
 
The redesigned organisation structure was compared to the organisation’s existing structure and it performed better 
than the existing structure. This gives credence to the viability of the quantitative approach as a tool for 
organisation’s design optimisation.

Contextualizing technology and digitalization in a period of having to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs), 
requires a paradigm shift which calls for collaboration from multiple stakeholders. The current turbulent 
environment requires an investigation into ways of adopting the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) as a pertinent 
mechanism for accelerating sustainable development goals. The need to formulate a conceptual framework and 
adapt it to the South African context, requires careful mapping of the elements of 4IR, the relevant infrastructure and 
resources There has been perceptions instigating resistance towards the SDGs, hence the need to develop the 
conceptual framework. The exploratory research method fitted well as its nature a systematic review to effect and 
respond to the abovementioned investigation. The study reviewed about 70 articles of which 53 of those were peer-
reviewed articles within 4th industrial revolution in South Africa as set for ecosystem. Due to limited research on the 
topic, possible impacting variables that added immeasurable value were explored as contributing factors the study. 
Both reviewed literature and government archive on 4th industrial revolution revealed how the ecosystems of 4IR 
accelerated the achievement of SDGs in South Africa. The study further singled smart factories, smart cities, 
integrated systems, green technologies, cybernetics, the internet of people, the internet of energy, and the internet of 
things as contributing factors towards 4IR. The recommended the applicability of the ecosystems onto the South 
African context to advance innovation agenda to achieve green energy, sustainable water provision, waste 
management, trade in low-carbon products, cleaner and greener technologies, green buildings, green chemistry and 
sustainable transport, as well as improved air quality.

Abstract  
 
Servant and authentic leadership styles have been known to elicit positive outcomes in all organizational 
levels, but are they adequate for the challenges presented by the VUCA world? In today’s business 
dynamics, it is exigent for Start-ups to adopt complex leadership traits to face the stiff competition. In this 
descriptive study, 586 employees working in STEM start-ups ranging from manufacturing, engineering 
and technology are chosen to understand the impact of authentic-servant leadership style on the 
employees’ burnout while the trust in supervisor is studied in a mediating role. The cohesiveness of 
authentic and servant leadership constructs is tested using Canonical Correlation. The empirical evidence 
shows that authentic servant leaders in a start-up would help reduce employees’ burnout experienced in 
their workplace. In times of uncertainty, when the leader is authentic while giving importance to the 
employees’ psychological well-being, in his or her transactions with the employees, it would go a long 
way in boosting their morale. This study is one of the first to identify the effectiveness of combining these 
two leadership styles and it contributes to the annals of leadership research in studying the triage of 
factors namely employee burnout, trust in supervisor and authentic-servant leadership in a start-up 
climate. The author concludes by charting out a detailed future agenda for attuning authentic-servant 
leadership practices towards sustainability of start-ups.

1. Introduction 
In times of exogenous shocks, challenges encountered by start-ups are more dynamic than established corporations 
(Manwaring et al. 2021). From the onset of the pandemic, the number of start-ups either succeeding or failing in 
these competitive times have been unprecedented, with many becoming unicorns, while many others have shut 
down. In this volatile atmosphere not just success, but even survival of start-ups rests solely on the leader. Leading 
them through the global turmoil is wrought with intangible parameters. The right leadership style is essential to 
spearhead the start-up in any eventuality (Sundermeier et al. 2020). Apart from the leaders of start-ups considered in 
the study, it has been found that even employees have been adversely affected by the pandemic. From the stress of 
handling work in these trying times, the employees are also experiencing an uncertain future, dependent on the 
economic health of the start-up (Joshi and Achuthan 2018). It is imperative to understand what can be done to 
improve the mental health of employees working in STEM start-ups. Authentic leadership and servant leadership 
styles have been extensively studied in various contexts and in interdisciplinary setting also. Even though there is a 
proliferation of leadership research, there is significant gap in leadership research in start-ups in volatile climate. 
Culture and organizational setting of a start-up is very unique and distinct from a typical corporation (Yue et al. 
2019). A unique contribution of this article is acknowledging there is a difference in leading corporates and start-ups 
and to propose a leadership framework for spearheading start-ups. The impact of the managers adopting a 
combination of these two highly effective leadership styles, in a start-up setting is observed in this paper. Identifying

Abstract 
 
There were many attempts to establish online learning in the education system that solely conducted the traditional 
face-to-face way of teaching and learning over the course of time. The expeditious development of the digital age 
made online learning emerge along with difficulties in dealing with engagement and misbehavior that is unique to 
the online environment. The study aimed to propose a decision matrix with respect to laboratory, lecture, 
assessment, and examination that will support and enhance the student engagement of students in an online learning 
set-up.  Additionally, the study also identified the common misbehaviors that students portrayed in an online set-up. 
The target respondents of the study are Engineering students and instructors across Metro Manila. Data collection 
was done via survey questionnaire for the students which were analyzed through Exploratory Factor Analysis 
(EFA). Moreover, an expert interview was conducted for the instructors to complete the Analytical Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) which was utilized to determine the most preferred component per criterion; laboratory prefers 
Collaboration with Peers, lecture prefers Student Support, assessment prefers Accessibility to Course Materials, and 
examination prefers Student Support. Common misbehaviors of Engineering students were also found to be present 
and common to most of the respondents.

Abstract 
 
3D Printing (3DP) technology, an additive manufacturing part layer by layer, has been widely used in various 
industries for prototype fabrication. In this project, the 3DP was utilized to investigate appropriate parameters for 
food fabrication. The objective was to determine processing factors that affected the quality of 3D printed specimens 
using the design of experiments (DOE). Gelatin-based food, one of the food mixtures commonly used in 3D food 
printing, was chosen as a case study. Independent variables consisting of print speed, flow rate, and printing 
temperature determined their contributions to specimen variation in weight and dimension. The result indicated that 
all these key factors significantly affect weight accuracy. However, only print speed and temperature affect the 
dimension accuracy of the printed food specimen. Furthermore, the optimal dimensions and weight accuracy 
conditions were found at 11.21 mm/s of print speed, 43.65 mm3/s of flow rate, and printing temperature at 35°C, 
resulting in 0% error on weight and volume of the 3D printed food product.

1. Introduction 
3DP technology, known as the additive manufacturing process, has been widely acknowledged and applied in 
several industries.  The process has many benefits, such as less material wastage in production, saving time, 
accuracy, high efficiency, and accessible design (Chen et al. 2019). Furthermore, the 3DP principles integrate a 
means of adding layer by layer to manufacture three-dimensional products with customized design, shape, taste, 
texture, color, and nutrition contents (Sun et al. 2015). Therefore, this technology can be extensively applicable to 
the food and pharmaceutical industries. In addition, 3DP can be used to create food products by controlling nutrition 
contents appropriate for each individual or specific consumer group, called personalization, including senior 
citizens, pregnant women, children, and athletes. 
 
In the 3D food printing process, hydrocolloid is a general mixture that forms a printable food, sometimes referred to 
as food ink. Hydrocolloids such as gelatin can play a crucial role in food ink properties by thickening, gelling, 
stabilizing, or emulsifying the food characteristics.  However, these various food characteristics can affect 3DP 
quality; it is necessary to study processing parameters in 3DP that contribute to a better quality of the printed 
product.  
 
1.1 Objectives 
This research aims to study the factors that impact food dimension and weight accuracy after being fabricated by 
3DP technology. These factors include print speed, flow rate, and printing temperature. The weight and dimension

5. Conclusion  
From this study, 3DP technology can be successfully employed for food processing. The gelatin-based material was 
used as a printed food, containing 10.00 grams of gelatin, 25.00 g of water, 20.25 g of sweetener, 20.00 g of soy 
protein, 0.50 g of sodium alginate, and 75.00 g of coconut milk. With this material, the optimal printing speed was 
found at 11.22 mm/ s, flow rate equals 43.66 mm3/s, and printing temperature equals 35.93 °C where the food 
product had a standard deviation in weight and volume was 14. 94 and 15. 33, respectively.  These fabrication 
parameters indicated the weight and volume errors equal to 0%. However, considering each dimension along the X 
Y and Z axis showed that the printed product has a lower value on height (Z-axis), while the size on the X Y plane is 
larger. The collapse of material could be the reason of this inaccuracy in product geometry. Further investigation to 
verify proper printing conditions and the rheology property of food prining materials were pursued to develop a 3D 
food printing system with accurate dimensions and volume.

Abstract  
 
Industry 4.0 is a concept that is critical for organizations to adopt to remain competitive. It is an entire new way of 
breaking the traditional approaches of operation in an organization. The changes brought about will also impact the 
workforce with the Banking industry. This study sought to evaluate the impact on the workforce of the 
implementation of Industry 4.0 in a Business Banking: Projects and Operations environment in a particular Bank. A 
qualitative research approach was undertaken using semi-structured interviews with eight subject matter experts 
within the unit. The Business Unit is well advanced in implementing disruptive technologies and at a moderate level 
in terms of transforming current processes and operations. The Business Unit also transforms existing architecture to 
suit the design principles of Industry 4.0. All these changes impact the workforce in the Business Unit such that it 
requires a modification of the working environment as well as modification of job profiles for both the lower and 
higher skilled workforce

1. Introduction  
Technology is significantly impacting day-to-day living. The increasingly connected culture we live in impacts the 
world of Industry giving rise to the fourth stage of industrialization known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0) (Kagermann, 2015).  
Pereira and Romero (2017) describe Industry 4.0 as a concept that embraces a set of future developments such as 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Services (IoS), Robotics, Big Data, 
Cloud Manufacturing and Augmented Reality. It is imperative for companies to adopt Industry 4.0 concepts and 
related technologies to embrace the trend of adopting frameworks of interconnectedness between people and objects 
which as a result allows companies to remain competitive in their market (Ślusarczyk, 2018). The integration of 
technologies, under the concept of Industry 4.0, is a drive towards breaking traditional approaches of operation and 
pursuing a drive toward efficiency (Ślusarczyk, 2018). 
 
Bonekamp and Sure (2016) suggest that the implementation of I4.0 will significantly impact the labour content and 
work organization to the extent that it influences the way people add value to the value chain within an organization.  
The impact is far reaching within an organization with not only the uneducated workforce being affected but also the 
educated workforce, who perform highly skilled job functions, through software algorithms that are able to perform 
analysis and consequently make automated decisions (Ford, 2009). 
 
The banking unit under study has a strong digital strategy which is motivated by the need to align to customer’s 
ever-changing requirements in an efficient way.  The recent drive within this Business Banking: Projects and 
Operations Unit has been pursuing a strategy to minimize operational cost as well as implementing high value 
business benefit solutions to remain profitable whilst aligning to the overall digital goals of the organization. The

6. Conclusion  
The findings suggest that the Business Unit is aggressively seeking to implement disruptive technologies and 
digitally transform current processes and operations in order to remain competitive, improve internal capability, 
improve client experience and to reduce operational costs. Due to the changes brought about through digital 
transformation, in conforming to Industry 4.0 standards, the findings resulted in the development of 3 themes 
particularly related to the impact of the workforce in this setting. The research suggests that there would be changes 
to the working environment such that it requires existing employees to broaden their skill set to be able to adapt in 
this environment. There would also be increased collaboration and changes to the types of teams required to 
successfully implement digital solutions. The digital behaviour being driven in the current working environment was 
found to create both opportunities and threats for the workforce. Opportunities were found in new roles and the 
knowledge gained from working with new technology but also for employees that have content specific knowledge 
in which their roles can be transformed to subject matter experts or key decision makers. The use of technology in 
the Business Unit was found to free up capacity for both the lower and higher skilled workforce to perform more 
valuable tasks. The threat, however, is for the employees unwilling to adapt, with the concern around the loss of jobs 
and broadening the skills gap thus being a constraining factor to digital transformation. The findings outlined that it 
is not only the responsibility of the Business Unit to provide training platforms for employees but it is key for 
employees to take on the responsibility of making use of the training platforms and materials provided to them so 
that they can be transitioned into the new job roles offered rather than becoming redundant.

Abstract 
Nowadays, Filipino online consumers are turning towards e-Commerce for retail acquisition, especially in the 
pandemic where Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises or MSMEs are affected. MSMEs make up 99.5% of the 
total businesses in the Country. Due to the pandemic, most MSMEs in the Country faced adversities that resulted 
in temporary closures or running on limited operations in compliance with the government protocols imposed for 
restricting the spread of the virus. The proponents focused on the Wholesale and Retail sectors since they are the 
most affected by the setbacks brought on by the pandemic. Hence, the study aims to identify the significant 
factors affecting consumers’ purchase intention. The results gathered are analyzed using Exploratory Factor 
Analysis to assess the underlying factors present in the study. A total of thirteen (13) variables were selected 
from the review of related literature. Exploratory Factor Analysis revealed that only nine (9) variables were 
significant. Moreover, the nine variables were divided into two (2) resulting factors. The two resulting underlying 
factors were analyzed based on the relationship of the variables under these factors and were named Present 
Hedonism and Platform Reliability through Thematic Analysis. The proponents utilized Analytic Hierarchy 
Process to determine the designated weights per variable under the two factors to complete the e-Commerce 
marketing decision matrix tools. The e-Commerce marketing decision matrix tools would help MSMEs 
maximize their digital footfall and profits.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
The present study aims to institute a decision matrix tool for MSME wholesale and retail owners in aiding them 
with their marketing strategies and maximizing their digital footfall using the marketing decision matrix. The 
study started with thirteen (13) variables in question. IBM SPSS results revealed that the variables Social Media, 
Trust and Security, Price Comparison, and Variety are insignificant factors or outliers in the study, having 
communality values of less than 0.4. 
 
The remaining variables were analyzed using Total Variance Explained and Scree Plot in identifying the two (2) 
underlying factors present. The proponents utilized Thematic Analysis and coined the two underlying factors as 
(1) Present Hedonism and (2) Platform Reliability. The first factor consists of Electronic Word-of-Mouth 
(eWOM), Convenience, Control, and Hedonic Values. On the other hand, the second factor incorporates Anxiety, 
Materialism, Actual and Post Purchase Behavior, Openness, and Enjoyment towards the Channel. Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used wherein the researchers designed decision matrices and individual interviews 
with MSME owners to generate and assign weights in the said factors. Afterward, the proponents established the 
marketing decision matrix tools following the study’s primary objectives. 
 
Lastly, the proponents believe that through the marketing decision matrix tools, e-Commerce business owners, 
specifically MSME owners transitioning from a brick-and-mortar setting, would be able to benefit significantly 
from the decision matrices because these tools would allow them to increase their digital footfall through the 
marketing strategies that would result from these tools in compliance with the decision criterion provided. The 
final product of the study can be seen in this document; Marketing Decision Matrix Tool Instructions. 
 
Future studies could improve the methodology by incorporating other factors influencing purchase intention and 
identifying who represents most of the e-commerce consumer profile, preferably male and female respondents, 
based on recent studies and statistical information.

Abstract  
 
The South African banking market has been largely dominated by the big four traditional banks i.e. FNB, ABSA, 
Standard Bank and Nedbank, prior to the implementation of digital banks. The introduction of these new entrants 
has meant the domination is starting to cease as many of the consumer and small & medium enterprise companies 
that banked with traditional banks are migrating to these entrants. This is because of the affordable pricing options 
and contextual solutions they offer, which are enabled through the use industry 4.0 technologies. With this in mind, 
a qualitative study was conducted to unpack what the commercial segment of a particular bank, Bank A, can do to 
bridge the digital divide opened by digital banks. The study concluded that Bank A should accelerate the adoption of 
industry 4.0 technologies to drive operational efficiencies and cost reduction, optimize business processes, apply 
agile project delivery methodologies to market solutions quicker than their competitors. This could be achieved by 
implementing a hybrid core banking application to enable the bank to adopt a progressive modernization strategy by 
using the best of legacy core system coupled with the new core banking application and collaborating with fintech 
companies to drive contextual solution delivery.

1. Introduction  
According to McKinsey (2017) Africa’s banking market is currently $86 billion in revenue before risk costs. 
Traditional banks who adopt digitalization can expect to grow their revenue by approximately 8.5% per year until 
2022 which will likely bring the continents revenue to $129 billion. Prior to the emergence of digital banks, banking 
in South Africa was largely dominated by the big four banks, i.e., FNB, ABSA, Nedbank, and Standard Bank. The 
dominance is slowly starting to cease now as a result of disruptions which are brought about by new digital banks 
such as Tyme Bank. The Citizen (2020) have reported that ABSA lost 200 000 entry level customers with one of the 
major factors being pricing. 
 
Temelkov (2020) argues that traditional banking business models were not challenged for decades, however, the 
2008 financial crisis has allowed for the birth of new entrants providing competition to incumbent traditional banks. 
Temelkov (2020), further argues the new entrants were born because of the changes in the regulations which eased 
the requirements to enter the financial services industry coupled with the rapid raise in technology. William (2018) 
contends that traditional banking is mostly associated with legacy operational systems, which are static to run 
particularly the core banking applications. This, as a result, makes traditional banks less responsive to change and 
seizing new market opportunities. According to FirstRand (2018), running legacy core banking applications and 
other I.T related systems on mainframe technology has resulted in approximately 11% of the operating costs

6. Conclusion  
From the study results, it may be concluded that that monthly account and transactional account fees have become 
important elements that drive the commercial banking segment competition. This is because of the launch of three 
digital banks i.e., Bank Zero, Tyme Bank and Discovery Bank in South Africa who have introduced commercial 
customers to the flexibility of having transactional accounts that do not require them to pay monthly fees. It is seen 
from the results that the commercial segment has large operational costs associated with operating and maintaining 
mainframe technology, having manual processes, operating branch and call center facilities, waterfall project 
delivery methodologies. These costs must be recovered through the customers transactional account and any other 
products they offer. In response the commercial segment must cut the operational costs by implementing the right 
industry 4.0 technologies as indicated by the results, enabling the core banking application that will benefit 
customers and optimizing the business processes. These implementations will enable the segment to shave off the 
monthly account fees and still provide the same value proposition that customers have. As such, the success of the 
commercial segment competing with digital banks will therefore be measured by the number of customers retained 
and new customers attracted because of the reduced monthly fees and the value they value proposition they have. 
 
Another important element that drives segment competition is the ability to enhance the customer experience by 
providing contextual solutions to meet and exceed customer needs, enabling easy to use digital channels, providing 
educational programmes to build customer trust and loyalty. Enhancing customer experience will also contribute to 
commercial segment competing with digital banks.

Abstract 
 
With the rapid development of fashion, it can boost labor-intensive industry players, especially in the garment 
sector. PT PBT is a garment company that produces make to order. This research will be carried out on jacket 
products, this is because it is in the old preparation department, causing a lot of waiting time. In addition, line 
balancing on PpA and Quilting processes is one of the focuses of this study. The purpose of this study is to 
identify the location of the bottleneck in the production process, in addition to knowing the bottleneck at the 
work station. The method used in this research is a simulation model. From the simulation results, it is found 
that two work stations have more than 50% full process so that improvements are made to the second scenario 
which can increase the total exit by 14%, besides that, it can reduce the average time in the system by 2% and 
reduce the average time in operation by 13%.

1. Introduction  
Fashion in Indonesia is currently growing very rapidly. This is in line with the awareness of the Indonesian 
people about fashion that leads to a lifestyle. With the very rapid development of fashion, it can boost labor-
intensive industry players, especially in the garment sector. according to (Rahmah, 2020) Labor-intensive 
industries are industries that have more human labor than machine labor. The labor-intensive industry in the 
garment sector has enormous potential in Indonesian exports. Faster market demand accompanied by the 
development of fashion will be a challenge for the garment industry in Indonesia. PT PBT is a garment company 
that produces make to order. The products produced are outdoor jackets, t-shirts and pants. In four months the 
demand for jackets has been increasing. With increasing demand, it is necessary to balance the production line 
so that production runs according to leadtime. according to (Novianto and Herdiman, 2020) identify problems in 
the production line, namely the number of bottlenecks that occur on the sewing line which causes the flow of the 
production process to not run smoothly so that the resulting output is not in accordance with the target. 
According to (Monte, 2021) simulation model has a purpose for decision making by using various data analysis. 
This research will be carried out on jacket products, this is because it is in the old preparation department, 
causing a lot of waiting time. In addition, line balancing on PpA and Quilting processes is one of the focuses of 
this study. The need for simulation of the preparation department to identify the location of the bottleneck in the 
production process, in addition to knowing the bottleneck at the work station. then line balancing will be carried 
out so that the production flow will not be hampered and get maximum output.

2.1 Simulation Model 
Simulation according to (Monte 2021) Simulation is the right tool to use, especially if it is required to conduct 
experiments in order to find the best comments from system components. The simulation approach often begins 
with the construction of a real system model. The model must be able to show how the various components in

The results obtained at the average time in operation there is a difference from the simulation model with 
scenario 1 there is a difference of 182.58 minutes. From this difference, we get a very high reduction in the 
average operating time. Compared to the difference between the simulation model and scenario 2, there is a 
difference of 76.26 minutes. From the average time in operation, it means that the smaller the operation, the 
less waste there is in each work process. According to (B et al. 2021) the increase in operating capacity can be 
done by increasing the number of machines or by the number of workers. So the scenario created is to increase 
the number of machines and the number of workers so that capacity can be increased and can reduce or 
eliminate bottlenecks at work stations. According to (Yemane 2021) on the basis of the time required for each 
operation, the reasons for line balancing are that: Maximum output, avoiding congestion, smooth flow of work 
(production), less supervision and effort. The main objective of this research is to increase productivity. 
 
 5. Conclusion 
In the simulation model, it can be seen that there are bottlenecks, there are two work stations, namely the 
numbering process and CNC (quilting) so that improvements are made to the system by increasing the number 
of machines and the number of people at the work station. In summary, the total exit difference between the 
simulation model and scenario 2 is higher than the simulation model with scenario 2 by 68. Meanwhile, in the 
summary of the average time in the system, the difference between the simulation model and scenario 2 is 
smaller than the difference between the simulation model and scenario 1, the value is 38 51 minutes. And the 
summary of the average time in operation the difference between the simulation model and scenario 1 is 
smaller than the difference between the simulation model and scenario 2, the value is 182.58 minutes. So the 
researchers chose scenario 2 as a system improvement because it can produce a total exit of 14% greater than 
the real condition, besides that it can reduce the average time on the system by 2% smaller than the real 
condition and at the average time of operation by 13%. smaller than the real condition. This means that 
scenario 2 can increase output and reduce the average time in the system and the average time in operation.

Abstract  
 
Risk exists in every aspect of a business, as it cannot be eliminated but rather reduced to an attainable level through 
the utilization of effective risk assessment techniques. Risk impacts people differently, some can be seen as risk-
seeking while the majority are risk-averse. For the insurance industry in particular, risk is traded and transferred to 
the insurance providers as insurance providers offer a shield from the exposure to risk consequences and the 
likelihood of loss, therefore, escalating the risk from the insured entity to the insurer for a given premium. In this 
research, a modern model to risk classification will be proposed for property lines insurance. The proposed model 
will be validated via data collected from case studies of an insurance company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
The model is expected to serve as a tool that helps provide better estimates of risk for various properties.

1. Introduction  
Risks in the financial industry refers to the amount of variability in the anticipated outcome of a business activity 
and the associated chances of the payoffs resulting of each outcome. It describes the amount of diversion from the 
expected and planned situations; the greater the diversion the greater the risk that is to be faced or tackled. When 
companies face decisions that include risk, they may have the option of either taking the risk through further 
involvement or avoiding it through disengagement from any new actions. Avoiding the risk means preferring the 
status quo as compared to taking the risk in a project with probabilistic outcomes. The risk-aversion or risk-taking 
depends on the resources available, the variability in payoffs, possibilities of states of nature, gains, losses, and risk 
attitudes.   
 
There are two different groupings of risk: systematic and unsystematic. Systematic risk refers to the external aspects 
that influence and cause a risk to a company’s investment, while the unsystematic refers to the assets that may 
influence the capabilities of a company or investor as risk occurs. Risks come from various sources, such as risk of 
liquidity, sovereign, business or insurance. For the purpose of this research, risk in insurance will be particularly 
highlighted and the various types will be discussed for the purpose of classifying the risk in insurance companies.  
Insurance industry helps safeguard companies and businesses from various risks that could occur every day. It gives 
a financial shield for the insured entity to redeem a loss when unpredicted events occur.  Moreover, it aids people in 
managing and predicting risks in order to keep them at a minimum. Insurance providers are constantly facing

4.2   Model Classification and Discussion  
The classification table lists the observed versus the predicted risk classification. In terms of prediction, the diagonal 
values represent the hits where the model predicted the risk classification accurately, while the off diagonals were 
the misses. Essentially, out of the 100 data points, the model predicted 89% of the cases and missed only 11% of 
them as seen in Table 7. The model has accurately predicted majority of the cases correctly. Hence, revealing the 
power of using this test for prediction. The cut-probability in this test was assumed to be 0.7 as it was the optimal 
value that gave the highest prediction percentage. Lastly, the classification plot is illustrated in figure 2 where each 
symbol representing two cases. This plot gives a graphical representation of the risk classes taken from the 
classification table, showing the cut observed group versus the predicted group and their frequencies alongside their 
probabilities.  As it can be seen, any point falling beyond the cut-probability 0.7 is to be considered as class B 
(risky), while the others being less than 0.7 are to be considered as class A (safe). The model has predicted 89% of 
the points accurately, while only 11% of them incorrectly and this can be seen from the plot. The points falling at the 
extreme left have the lowest probability and are to be considered as class A (safe), while the ones falling at the 
extreme right carry the highest probabilities and are to be classified as class B (risky).  
 
5. Conclusion and Future Research 
In summary, the paper evaluated the binary logistic regression model for predicting the risks in property lines in an 
insurance company. It displayed a high performance and accuracy in predicting risk for a given set of input variables 
regarding the properties. The model was capable of detecting majority of the points (89%) and cases accurately 
when comparing the predicted cases versus the observed cases in terms of risk classification. As a result, it can be 
concluded that this case study underlined the benefits of utilizing regression models in risk prediction, assisting the 
companies in making better decisions on whether they should insure a property given the level or classification of 
risk it falls under. Consequently, this will enhance their financial performance along with the client experience, since 
the insurer will be able to give the best cover option for the insured based on the outputs of the classification model. 
Future research can be further made on the basis of significant variables only, to see how the model will respond in 
terms of correct predictions.

Abstract 
 
An influencer's credibility is the attractiveness, trust, and expertise for commercial purposes. The credibility of 
gender equality is also a unique variable to be tested to determine whether there is an influence on the brand 
displayed by the celebrity brand ambassador. This research was conducted in a big city in Indonesia with time-
consuming in 3 months. This study uses a quantitative approach with a non-probability sampling method with a 
purposive sampling technique. The data obtained were analyzed carefully, and the results showed that H1 was 
accepted, meaning that Celebrity Attractiveness had a positive influence on the Relatedness need satisfaction of 
cosmetic users in the city of Semarang. H2 is accepted, meaning that Celebrity Trustworthiness positively influences 
the Relatedness to need satisfaction of cosmetic users in the city of Semarang. Based on statistical tests, the results 
showed an effect of the Celebrity Expertise variable. H3 is accepted, meaning that Celebrity Expertise positively 
influences the Relatedness to need satisfaction of cosmetic users in the city of Semarang. H4 is accepted, meaning 
that Relatedness needs satisfaction positively influence brand passion for Semarang cosmetic users.

1. Introduction  
In overcoming this, companies must create product characteristics while giving a positive impression to customers 
(Purba and Panday 2012); (Radnan and Purba 2018). The use of a character to become an influencer in product 
marketing is the choice of a company (Weismueller et al. 2020). One strategy to increase sales is advertising with 
the use of celebrity endorsers. There are several stages of consideration, including the level of popularity of the 
celebrity itself with the problem of whether the chosen celebrity can represent the character of the product being 
advertised. The use of the endorser is expected to provide a positive associative between the product and the 
endorser (Darlius and Keni, 2021, Liu et al. 2020). These associatives can simply appear in the form of certain 
thoughts or images that are associated with a brand. Influencer figures are interested and well known by the certain 
community of the product.  At present, Indonesia is still the most extensive and very potential consumer. Moreover, 
buying and selling activities have shifted from conventional to digital in this all-digital era (Purba 2015, Purba et al. 
2020). It gives rise to the phenomenon of competition in the beauty business world, which is becoming very 
competitive (Hamadamin and Atan 2019). After all, they can make customers have a good memory of the product 
because the Indonesian people currently like new things and are thirsty for new products introduced by the company 
(Sopiah and Etta 2013). The company's innovations and customer loyalty are also important in the long term 
because they can make customers keep buying the product (Weismueller et al., 2020); (Adirinekso et al., n.d.). 
Because if the company already has loyal customers with their products, it will become a crucial asset for the 
company. Here can be a good start for the company to maintain attractiveness for consumers to maintain the target 
market and develop it so that it can control sales (Widjaja et al. 2019).

Relatedness need satisfaction, which in t-count of 3,190 > t table (1,645) and a p-value (significance) of 0.002 < 
0.05. This means that H1 in this study is accepted or concludes that Celebrity Trustworthiness positively influences 
Relatedness need satisfaction. 
 
Hypothesis 2 
Next is the influence of the Celebrity Expertise variable on the Relatedness need satisfaction which has a t-count 
value of 3,337. This value is greater than t table (1.645) and the p-value (significance) is 0.001 < 0.05. This means 
that H2 in this study is accepted or has a conclusion that Celebrity Expertise has a positive influence on Relatedness 
need satisfaction."" The beta coefficient value of 0.253 means that every 1 point increase of celebrity expertise will 
increase relatedness need satisfaction by 0.253. 
 
Hypothesis 3 
Furthermore, the relationship between the Celebrity Attractiveness variable and the Relatedness need satisfaction 
has a t-count value of 5,121. This value is greater than t table (1.645) and the p-value (significance) 0.000 < 0.05. 
This means that H3 in this study is accepted or has a conclusion that Celebrity Attractiveness has a positive 
influence on Relatedness need satisfaction."" The beta coefficient value of 0.401 means that every 1 point increase of 
celebrity attractiveness will increase relatedness need satisfaction by 0.401. 
 
Hypothesis 4 
The fourth is the relationship of the Relatedness need satisfaction variable to Brand Passion which has a t-count 
value of 9.594. This value is greater than the t-table (1.645) and the p-value (significance) 0.000 < 0.05. This means 
that H4 in this study is accepted or has a conclusion. Relatedness need satisfaction has a positive influence on Brand 
Passion."" The beta coefficient value of 0.484 means that every 1 point increase in Relatedness need satisfaction will 
increase brand passion by 0.484. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis and discussion described in the previous discussion. The following are the conclusions of this 
study. 
1) H1 is accepted, meaning that Celebrity Attractiveness positively influences the Relatedness to need 
satisfaction of cosmetic users in the Semarang city. 
2) Wardah's celebrity attractiveness as a brand ambassador variable is suitable and significantly affects 
satisfaction.  The test results use the correlation coefficient, coefficient of determination, regression 
analysis, and t-test showed that the celebrity brand attractiveness variable had a significant effect. 
3) H2 is accepted, meaning that Celebrity Trustworthiness positively influences the Relatedness to need 
satisfaction of cosmetic users in the city of Semarang.  
4) Celebrity Trustwthines variable is included in the outstanding category and significantly affects 
purchasing decisions. The test results use the correlation coefficient, 
5) coefficient of determination, regression analysis, and t-test showed that the Celebrity Trustworthiness 
variable had a significant, strong, and positive effect on the satisfaction of cosmetic users. Even though 
there are still consumers who think that Wardah is not diversifying its products, some consumers are 
still doubtful about the quality of Wardah's products and think that innovation and development of 
Wardah products tend to be slow.  
6) H4 is accepted, meaning that Relatedness need satisfaction has a positive influence on the brand passion 
for cosmetic users in the city of Semarang 
7) The decision to Relatedness need satisfaction in the city of Semarang is in the excellent category, which 
is influenced by the satisfaction and brand passion variables. The test results use the regression 
coefficient, the coefficient of determination, regression analysis, and F test, thus indicating that the 
celebrity brand ambassador and brand image variables have a strong and positive effect on purchasing 
decisions.

Abstract 
 
The need for efficient solid waste management to value added products like bio coal is increasingly becoming 
important. Bio coal generated from biomass. This work focused on the design and development of a bio coal 
pelletizing machine to enhance the energy efficiency of bio coal produced from biomass. A bio coal pelletizing 
machine with potential to pelletize 69 tons/day bio coal was developed with stainless steel as the material of 
construction. The mode of operation was batch wise and a residence time of 2.5 hours is required. Health and 
safety consideration during the operation of the bio coal pelletizer were considered through a detailed HAZOP 
analysis and establish a process control around the pelletizer. A bio coal pelletiser was designed and developed 
for optimum energy efficiency in the bio coal sector. The pelletiser was made up of stainless steel and a design 
stress of 45 N/mm2. The design pressure of the pelletiser was 1.3 atmospheres and had a cross sectional area of 
8.8 m2. Optimum operation of the pelletiser was achieved through a HAZOP and process control analysis

1. Introduction 
The need for efficient solid waste management to value added products like bio coal is increasingly becoming 
important. Bio coal generated from biomass such as brewers spent grain has been reported to be renewable, 
sustainable and also burns at the same intensity as coal (Monzon 2000). For this value to be achieved from the 
bio coal there is need to consider pelletization of the bio coal. The process of pelletization involves the 
production of larger bodies from smaller bodies through the process of agglomeration (Dmitrienko et al. 2018). 
Pelletization promotes dust control, decreases transportation costs due to the densification and any losses from 
breakages. The need for an optimally designed pelletiser then becomes important. This study looked at the 
design and development of a bio coal pelletizer for the production of 70 tons of bio coal per day.

equipment components. The pelletizing rate is affected by the paste flow rate (Sanchez et al. 2015; Staples et al. 
2017). The pelletizing rate transmitter measures the pelletizing rate and sends a signal to the pelletizing rate 
controller (PRC). Comparison of the process variable to flow rate occurs; a signal is computed and sent to the 
flow controller. The flow controller signals the valve to close or open.

Abstract  
 
Scrapping and rework are a manufacturing reality that influences the automotive manufacturing industry. This 
research utilizes System Dynamics modeling and simulation tools to study the causalities and feedback relationships 
for defects which contribute to the scrapping and rework of vehicles in an automotive manufacturing company based 
in South Africa. It also recommends remedies for scrap and rework reduction. The causes of defects were identified 
by consulting the company documents, and the cause and effects and improvement feedback relationship were 
explored using system dynamics (SD) models. The SD simulation models were created following the five steps of 
the system dynamics modelling process, namely problem articulation, formulation of a dynamic hypothesis; 
formulation of a simulation model; testing of the model; and policy design and evaluation. Based on identified root 
causes for defects and the simulation results, resources and techniques for process improvement were recommended. 
The paper demonstrates the usefulness of system dynamics modelling tools for solving problems in the automotive 
manufacturing sector. Building simulation models can reveal previously hidden relationships, provide systematic 
ways to analyse manufacturing defects, and allow the user to test effects of different alternative scenarios without 
having to make changes to the real system 
 
Keywords   
Modeling and Simulation, System dynamics, and Scrap and rework 
 
1. Introduction 
Scrapping and rework cost the automotive industry billions every year, while the price paid by companies for poor 
product quality is steep. Even though most businesses think they account for re-work and reject rates, the 
consequences are usually much more far-reaching. In fact, rework and scrapping issues influence the quality, 
delivery times, sales and crucially, brand image. As such, it is no surprise that every company's goal is to produce 
high-quality products at the lowest possible cost (Kcprofessional 2015). While many types of research performed up 
to the present have proved that scrapping and rework can be reduced through the implementation of quality control 
tools, a few types of research precisely investigate the factors that contribute to scrapping and rework using the 
system dynamics modeling and simulation tools in the automotive manufacturing industry. “SD is the study of the 
information feedback characteristics of industrial activity to illustrate how organisational structure, changes in 
policies, and time delays in decision and actions interact to affect the success of the organisation” (Khakifirooz et al. 
2018). Building simulation models can reveal previously hidden relationships, provide systematic ways to analyse 
manufacturing defects, and allow the user to test effects of different alternative scenarios without having to make 
changes to the real system (Strandhagen et al. 2020).  
 
The case company is one of the biggest automotive manufacturing companies in South Africa with ISO 9001 
standards certification and traces its roots all the way back to 1911. Yet they face manufacturing defects, which 
results in part scrapping, part reworks, vehicle reworks, and vehicle scrapping. These costs the company lot of 
money based on the internal cost of non-conformance paid for reworks and scrapping of parts and cars in order to 
avoid external failure costs that will be transferred to customers, thus generating liabilities that affect warranty work.

157","The model behaves according to expectations. An average delay time of 3 months shows improved results for defect 
creation compared with an average delay time of 6 months, thus reducing the defect accumulation. The same applies 
to the average delay time for 9 months. It can be observed that delivering the allocated resources for process 
improvement in months 3 and 6 reduces the defects much quicker than delivering the resources in month 9. The 
simulation results also indicate that a reduced delay time also results in smaller oscillations and moves towards an 
equilibrium more quickly. A reduced average delay time drops the defect creation rate, thus saving the organisation 
both time and money spend on scrapping and rework. 
 
6.3 Proposed Improvements  
Based on the identified root causes of defects and the simulation results, resources and techniques for process 
improvement need to be allocated. The calculated average contribution indicates that people are the main 
contributing source of defects, followed by machine, environment and methods. Thus, training of the organization 
employees is recommended. Training the workforce to the highest standards will improve product quality, 
employees will be able to make better and economical use of material and equipment’s. this will reduce waste and 
lead to low cost of quality. 
 
The simulation results also revealed that defects could be reduced through the allocation and delivery of resources 
for process improvement. In order to save the organisation both time and money, the delivery of resources needs to 
be prioritized, and the average delay time in the delivery of resources needs to be reduced as much as possible. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The purpose of this study was to identify the causes of defects and to develop a system dynamics model for studying 
the causalities and feedback relationships for defects that contribute to the scrapping and rework of vehicles, as well 
as recommend remedies for scrap and rework reduction in an automotive manufacturing company based in South 
Africa. The research objectives were accomplished, and the introduction of the proposed SD model can reduce 
defects, increase productivity and reduce overall cost. The causes of defects were identified from the company 
documents and the cause and effect relationships were explored using system dynamics models. The remedies for 
defect reduction were recommended based on the research findings and simulation results. 
 
For future research studies, the simulation models could be a starting point for defect reduction in the automotive 
manufacturing industry and they can be combined with actual organisation/plant data to further refine the model. 
Depending on the scope of the problem being investigated, the model can be further extended to include other 
factors such as costing per resource for process improvement, deeper detail for the causes of defects, and sub-
systems for maintenance strategies. The research study has highlighted that there are limited published papers using 
system dynamics (SD) as a tool for problem solving in the SA automotive manufacturing sector. More research in 
this area is still required as SD modelling has proven to be an excellent tool for the tracing of problems to their 
actual root causes, assessing a system’s ability to adjust to change and to test new decisions that must be taken.

Abstract  
 
When it comes to brick-and-mortar retailing and E-Commerce, anticipating demand accurately is one of the most 
important aspects in minimizing loss (through unavailability of items) and maximizing profit for any time period. 
This literature review aims to pursue a deeper understanding in founding a prediction model for forecasting retail 
sales by using deep learning techniques. The researchers gathered various papers from reputable publishers and 
institutions and sorted those that dealt with the use of deep learning techniques and machine learning techniques. 
The researchers found that the most frequent techniques used are Long-Short Term Memory and Random Forest for 
deep and machine learning respectively. Thus, the researchers proposed a model using LSTM with learning features 
inherited from common features observed through the related studies gathered and Random Forest as the proposed 
comparator or baseline model.

1. Introduction  
Store sales are a fundamental aspect of retail. Administrators critically examine the most reliable models to aid in 
predicting future sales.  Predicting store sales can assist in foreseeing future fluctuations or increase in sales to 
prepare decision-making based on past and current data. Through accurate prediction, this will aid in guiding 
companies or merchants in acquiring higher profits and improving customer experience through understanding sales 
patterns and trends. Using deep learning and machine learning techniques in predicting retail store sales provide 
high accuracy due to its basis and training on previous data. 
 
This paper presents deep learning and machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and Long Short-
Term Memory, which will be examined through various methods to determine the most accurate algorithm in retail 
sales prediction based on the twenty (20) papers collected from 2017 to 2021.

5. Implication and Conclusion 
In conclusion, the systematic literature review of this paper has been successful in terms of determining the deep 
learning techniques and machine learning techniques utilized in the chosen studies and their methods in 
implementing specific algorithms in testing the accuracy of the chosen prediction models as well as determining 
which technique has the greatest precision in forecasting and projecting future sales prediction. The study was based 
on 46 gathered research studies from reputable sources that have been thoroughly filtered. After the two-step 
filtering process, this has led to 20 relevant studies in which the set of deep learning techniques and machine 
learning techniques applied were considered. The filtered papers are related to our study about sales prediction with 
the application of deep learning techniques. Based on the 20 filtered studies, it has been identified that the most 
predominant deep learning technique used is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Random Forest (RF) 
for the machine learning technique. The researchers came up with a proposed system that primarily utilized the 
algorithms of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) when dealing with time-series data to forecast sales and used 
the algorithms in the Random Forest (RF) as a baseline of the study to compare with the applied prediction model in 
the proposed system. The conclusions of this study's research can be utilized as a reference in the future for research 
that will incorporate the usage of deep learning models for sales prediction. 
 
6. Limitation and Future Research  
The limitations of the study will be assessed and improved upon by future researchers in related studies. It is 
recommended to improve the proposed system to a more enhanced and developed design. The researchers also 
suggest that future researchers increase the number of studies selected to widen the study’s scope and conduct 
further analysis in applying deep learning to predict retail store sales better.

Abstract 
 
The technical solution used to improve and manage the storage and retrieval of data from databases is known as a 
database management system (DBMS). A transaction signifies a change in the database's data. It is an activity or 
sequence of operations performed by a single user or application software to read or change the database's contents. 
A transaction can fail before all the actions in the set are completed, which is a concern. This might occur because of 
a power outage, a system crash, or other factors while Concurrency Control in a Database Management System is a 
method of controlling many actions at the same time without their interfering. To resolve these issues, the various 
techniques are presented in this study with discussion of techniques and algorithms used. Concurrency control 
methods like locking, timestamps, and Optimistic Concurrency Control can be used to handle concurrent 
transactions and avoid conflicts. Studying a distributed database for relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB), 
as well as the implementation and performance of ACID transactions in NoSQL, is another proposal (MongoDB).

1. Introduction 
Databases allow users to store, retrieve, and analyze data quickly and easily. For business and research, databases 
are essential. organizations and other fields where data has important role to play. Globally in business environment, 
organizations are to process more data than ever before. All the crucial business decisions are made on the basis on 
that available data and only well-designed data management policy will make data more reliable to help make better 
decisions Rana et al. (2018). Concurrency Control in a Database Management System is a method of controlling 
many actions at the same time without their interfering. It ensures that Database transactions are completed in a 
timely and accurate manner to deliver accurate results without compromising the database's data integrity. However, 
the system is saturated with conflicts due to frequent rollbacks, long time waiting and blocking, and a high rate of 
aborted transactions, resulting in deadlock. Additionally, the evolution of distributed systems applications 
accelerates, accompanied by the emergence of several other new challenges in need of resolution and the demand 
for technologies that regulate the distributed environment. MongoDB is a significant rival to MySQL, as well as a 
complement to it. It outperforms SQL in a variety of domains and circumstances when compared to MySQL. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The Internet, particularly social media and instrument sensors are largely to blame for such massive data 
dissemination and complexity. The concept of adopting a relational model as a ""one-size-fits-all"" solution has been 
questioned as to whether it can meet these new difficulties, hence other data models known as NoSQL are being 
investigated Deari (2018). To resolve these issues, the various techniques are presented in this study. Different

196","6. Implication and Conclusion 
Most distributed computer systems performed one or more interdependent or concurrent transactions. Concurrency 
control techniques such as Locking, Timestamps, and Optimistic Concurrency Control, and prevent conflict, can be 
used to manage concurrent transactions. The deadlock problem occurs in transactions when four requirements are 
met: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no pre-emption, and circular wait Hamied (2018). The use of cache-based 
query optimization to increase response time is a good alternative since it saves a lot of money and effort, especially 
when implementing a cache at each site instead of a single network-based cache. It has been discovered that caching 
is now used in homogenous distributed databases. In terms of future research, the presented approach may be used 
to implement heterogeneous distributed databases Rana et al. (2018). In the comparison of Relational (MySQL) and 
NoSQL (MongoDB), MongoDB is a schema-less database with the ability to run in a distributed environment. It is 
ideally suited to instances when data is not precisely organized, and handling is not difficult. It may also be used in 
cloud services and can easily grow horizontally utilizing sharding Hamied (2018). Rather of competing, SQL and 
document-based databases are complementary. MongoDB is a schema-less database that may be used in a variety of 
applications a dispersed environment it is well positioned in situations when the data is not strictly structured and 
not complex to handle. MongoDB is a strong competitor/supplement to MySQL. Compared to MySQL, it 
outperforms SQL in various areas and scenarios. As a result, it becomes a popular database. Deari (2018). 
MongoDB performs better other databases in CRUD operations, especially when dealing with huge amounts of data 
and multiple users Pandey (2020). This study identified that several relevant studies were examined, and practically 
all of them concluded that NoSQL databases are a superior solution for big cloud-based applications. 
 
7. Limitation and Future Research 
Future improvements and applications currently, cache is enabled. Only homogeneous distributed databases are 
suitable for based query optimization. This technology may be used in the future. implemented for a variety of 
database types Rana et al. (2018). Future researchers also will be able to examine and improve the research's 
limitations in comparable investigations. Another recommendation is also study on a distributed database for 
relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB), as well as the implementation and performance of ACID 
transaction in NoSQL (MongoDB).

Abstract 
 
The viral phenomenon of plant gardening and parenting is the current trend in coping with quarantined 
and lockdown during Covid-19. This is when Internet-of-Things (IoT) can become more useful.  With the 
rise of IoT, microcontrollers became a staple with regards to IoT projects. A microcontroller is a 
computer on a single integrated circuit that includes a CPU, RAM, ROM, and I/O ports; some famous 
examples are the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Board. Raspberry Pi is a low-cost and credit card size 
computer, enabling people of all ages to learn computer programming. Smart-Agriculture is an advanced 
agricultural system that has been broadly polished in developed nations to address the difficulties of 
increasing demand for food. Smart farming includes a variety of communication and information 
technologies to improve the quality and quantity of crops. This study is about the development of an 
automated watering system for urban gardens. This includes automatic watering on the garden plots based 
on current soil conditions or soil moisture. The developed system went to a series of designs and analyses 
and passed all functionality testing.

1. Introduction  
In this Covid-19 pandemic time, a lot of people are confined to their homes and trying to cope up with quarantine 
and lockdown periods. The adjustment made in dealing with stress of an individual towards a drastic change of 
habits or environment turned to current trend of growing plants in our own yard or even inside the house (Sunga and 
Advincula,. 2021) (Omadlao et al. 2020). Plant growing or parenting has been popular practice that gives therapeutic 
effect in decreasing anxiety and discomfort in home confinement (Rivas and Biana. 2021).   
 
The continuous development of the concept of the Internet -of-Things (IoT); rapidly improves our way of living 
through many innovations, which allow the interaction of mundane things via the Internet. With years of 
development history, IoT continues to give birth to new technologies (Palatella et al. 2016). Internet -of-Things 
(IoT) plays an essential role in connecting and making easy access to previously not connected systems to the 
Internet (Rao. 2017). Using microcontrollers, this paved way to the development of automate labor-intensive tasks 
using a Raspberry Pi regarding urban gardening, which becomes popular in response to crises (Camps-Calvet et al. 
2015). 
 
Smart-agriculture is a complex agrarian system that has been widely refined in developing countries to meet the 
challenges of rising food demand. To increase the quality and quantities of crops, smart farming employs a variety 
of contact and information technology.  The automation of a watering system will reduce the cost of energy, time,

6. Conclusion  
This study focuses on developing a way to assist gardeners in managing, monitor, and water their gardens. 
Interviews, published journals, and articles were used as a reference in establishing the objectives of the study. The 
study’s finding shows that setting a more precise and consistent amount of water-to-soil ratio regardless of the plot's 
ambient humidity and temperature would benefit the target users. The amount of water available to the plants 
depends on the type/mix of soil on the plot and how much water it can hold, preferably loam soil which holds the 
optimal soil moisture for most plants. The study created a system that monitors the plot's soil moisture and 
automatically releases water based on the set threshold; the set threshold automatically adjusts depending on the 
ambient humidity and temperature of the plot. The developed system accurately display the soil's humidity; the 
system uses a soil moisture sensor to detect the plot's accurate water-to-soil ratio. The system is also not releasing 
water if the water-to-soil ratio is above the set threshold. Based on the testing results, the system developed passed 
all its test cases. Also, the user acceptance test (UAT) results show that the system functionality requirements were 
met and achieved.  
 
An automated watering system that is deployed in an urban garden setting help in managing the garden.  Based on 
the result of user acceptance test, all respondents gave positive remarks and agreed that the system could provide 
significant help in aiding the watering process. The positive feedback from the target users reflect that 80% agreed 
that the system would promote a faster gardening routine. The gardeners, also locally known as plantitos and 
plantitas noted that the system would ease the watering process and promotes a faster and more consistent gardening 
routine.

Abstract 
 
As a result of the growing population of persons with disabilities and senior citizens in the city of Makati City 
Philippines, there is a high-demand for medical consultations and medication. The need for process improvement 
that will answer the health tracking and prescriptive medicine delivery monitoring system is needed. Previous 
studies relating to delivery systems and automated scheduling has influenced the research in regards to building a 
web-based system that allows persons with disabilities and senior residents to easily maneuver around the 
restrictions of COVID-19. Data collected for the research was done by sampling technique through a descriptive 
research design to be able to collect surveys, and data in the presence of COVID-19 where social distancing is 
required. Results of the user acceptance testing shows that the developed web application passed all the requirement 
set in this study and the process included followed the Makati City local governments process, as well as the 
standard medical practice.

1. Introduction  
In the situation brought by COVID-19 (Official Philippine Gazette, n.d.), the Philippines had to undergo Enhanced 
Community Quarantine (ECQ) where the country is under lockdown and no Filipino is allowed to go out (except 
when necessary) to contain the virus. Filipinos are compelled to stay at home, and this brought different 
opportunities to bring necessities like food and water straight to their homes (Habamwabo, D. and Mpagazi, 2017). 
Directly accessing pharmaceutical goods is of prime importance especially to those not feeling well. Not only during 
COVID-19 is it necessary to have medications but for everyday use as well because many depend on medications to 
fight diseases and viruses, and also to stay strong. Many companies and businesses prove that delivery of products 
online is possible therefore opening opportunities to have other daily necessities delivered. 
 
Based from the current process of the Barangay Health Center (Garfin et al. 2017), the main objective of this study 
is to be able to develop a Web-based application that will function as automated medical health tracking through 
prescriptions of medications and medicine delivery tracking. The following are the specific objectives of the study: 
1) To develop a Web-based application for the doctors and pharmacists with the intent to add, update, and remove 
information relating to the requesting and prescribing medications; 2) To enhance the issuance of prescriptions to 
yellow cardholders; 3) To generate a systematic delivery schedule for the partner pharmacy to follow and to 
implement it with every medicine delivery; 4) To monitor the acknowledgment of the recipient's confirmed 
medicine delivery; 5) To track the yellow cardholders' health in every medicine delivery fulfilled. The existing 
process flow of medicine delivery before and during COVID-19 are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. The 
developed system’s process flow is shown in Figure 3.

214","5. Conclusion  
The medical health tracking and medicine delivery system focuses on health tracking of the patient’s prescriptions 
and medicine delivery system. The information on the prescription drugs prescribed by the doctors to the patients 
after consultation is immediately sent to the pharmacy for delivery to the patient’s home. After this has been 
implemented, respondents from the survey have recommended trying virtual consultations and appointments made 
through the web-based application. 
 
The yellow card system offered mostly to persons with disabilities and senior citizens, and the benefits it comes with 
given by the local government of Makati - allowing their residents to obtain free prescriptions and consultations - 
has proved through the documents and facts stated in this study that their current system can further be improved. 
The case study presents a problem in the current system with the yellow cardholders who are classified as either a 
person with a disability or an elderly who are considered not physically competent which is a complication in 
picking up their prescription medicine. This study used these problems to create a web-based application that would 
allow medical health tracking and medicine delivery for yellow cardholders to simplify the process for all involved. 
The results of the survey concluded that the web-based application developed made it possible to provide a 
systematic process of keeping track of the Makati residents and barangay health center patient’s prescriptions, as 
well as the delivery status of their upcoming prescriptions, rather than having to travel to the pharmacy repeatedly. 
The developed application also enabled doctors to keep track of their patient’s prescriptions if there is a need to 
update the prescriptions. The web-based application allows a lesser need to travel to pharmacies and consultations. 
This proves that the developed system reduced the need for physical contact between patients and physicians 
benefitted yellow cardholders who are physically incapable especially during Covid-19 restrictions or lockdown. It 
is also suggested to further involve more people in the study to lessen face-to-face interaction and movement 
especially for those not physically capable. 
 
Despite the creation of a new system, there can be further study needed for the improvements of this system that 
focus more on data analysis of health records that can project future legislation with informed decisions, not only in 
Makati City.

Abstract 
 
In the past few years, Big Data Analytics has advanced in improving firms' decision-making capabilities and 
developing and optimizing the day-to-day operations of other mainstream industries. The extent of implementing 
Big Data and Big Data analytics has become unimaginable in comparison to what industries use it for in its early 
stages. This paper highlights the increase of Big Data Analytics implementation throughout several industries and 
practices. This paper aims to highlight the innovation and improvements Big Data Analytics has brought upon these 
industries, as well as the challenges of implementing Big Data Analytics.

1 Introduction 
According to Chris Anderson's Wired Magazine editorial from 2008, we now live in the 'Petabyte Age.' (Anderson 
2008). The adjective 'big' does not even come close to adequately describing the amount of data that is being 
collected, processed, loaded, and analyzed nowadays. The Large Hadron Collider located in CERN alone had up to 
15 petabytes of data in 2010, while CISCO obtained over 667 exabytes of data in 2013. The idea and concept of Big 
Data Analytics implementation already existed even before we knew it. However, the term has since then become 
famous as technology exponentially evolved throughout the years. 
 
When talking about hundreds of petabytes of data, it is not just a simple data set that we can easily collect, ingest, 
and analyze as we did with traditional database systems (Kaisler et al. 2013). Big Data calls for a revolutionary 
approach that data specialists have worked on for the past few years to catch up with the ever-growing demand for 
data analysis. The continuous evolution of technology has undoubtedly brought the invaluable importance of relying 
on data to improve decision-making capabilities and develop a plethora of automated and intelligent systems for our 
disposal. The role of big data has never been more significant in today's era ranging from a system recommending 
what one should watch next on Netflix to automating systems in a developing Smart City. 
 
According to Google Trends, the rise of interest in big data worldwide began growing in the early 2011s and has 
consistently grown since. Statista says the global big data analytics market will continue to grow at a 30% rate, with 
revenue coming close to 68 billion USD by 2025 (Statista, n.d.). This shows that big data analytics has become more 
prominent and that more and more companies and industries are continually jumping into the hype of implementing 
big data analytics. 
 
Some of the biggest industries that invested early on in big data analytics implementation are healthcare (Viceconti 
et al. 2015), agriculture (Kamilaris et al. 2017), military (Song et al. 2015), banking (Hassani et al. 2018), among 
several others. These industries may have different specific purposes for utilizing big data analytics implementation.

222","also integrated for future iterations of Big Data implementations as it records what is currently working with the 
current implementation and can be used in further updates and improvements. 
 
The template should be managed and analyzed by industry-specific experts as they may have the depth of 
understanding and knowledge required to develop and manage a big data project in their organization/industry. Each 
industry will require a different input for each level in the hierarchy, thus requiring experts to carefully analyze each 
step moving forward to overcome the challenges they might encounter or currently encountering. Several studies 
have already implemented the model above in a specific industry, such as smart cities development (Barham and 
Daim 2020) and have successfully employed the HDM to build a readiness assessment system for data analytics 
implementation. 
 
7 Implications and Conclusions 
This study aimed to define the significant categories of challenges that industries face when employing big data 
implementations to improve and innovate their operations. With the four (4) defined key challenges described as 
Technical, Business, Operational, and Security, the study aimed to have a generalized yet systematic decision-
making process to overcome these challenges. 
 
While the model proposed above will require a significant amount of research and fine-tuning per specific industry 
or organization, the study proposes that sophisticated decision-making processes will help industry practitioners 
develop innovative and effective solutions. 
 
8 Limitations and Future Research 
The limitations of this research would be the small-scale number of research papers collected, which might have 
overlooked other considerable challenges those other industries are experiencing. Another method of searching 
could be employed, particularly looking up major industries and other categories of challenges being encountered. 
The model proposed above is also a generalized way of creating a systematic decision-making process. Future 
research could investigate fine-tuning the model into which industries are being affected per challenge category. 
This paper recommends creating a repository of derived models from the mentioned decision-making system above 
and creating a systematic analysis.

Abstract  
 
Variation orders are unwanted but inevitable reality of any construction project and affect project performance as 
they adversely affect productivity and project cost. Moreover, projects with many variation orders cause the contrac-
tor to achieve lower productivity levels than planned. Therefore, the study is based on the impact of variation orders 
which adversely impact project performance in terms of cost, time, quality degradation, health and safety issues and 
professional relations. Quantitative approach was adopted for this study. 159 Questionnaires were analysed after the 
data was collected online via a structured questionnaire. Factor analysis was conducted, correlation matrix, coeffi-
cients has been conducted to ensure visibility of co-efficients greater than 0.3 and Kaiser-Meyer-Oklim (KMO) and 
Bartletts were conducted. From the findings it transpired that additional payment for contractors; delayed schedule 
completion; increases in project cost; time overruns, logistics delays also cause disputes among the professional 
team were some of the impacts caused by variation orders just to mentioned a few. The more the number of varia-
tion orders, the more they are likely to affect the overall construction delivery cost. In fact, variation orders have 
both a direct and indirect effect on cost.

1. Introduction  
The construction industry is often affected by changes that are happening in the construction market and in turn af-
fects the client’s needs and requirements during construction. These changes include emerging technologies which 
have a tendency of contributing to the occurrence of change orders (Memon 2014). Variations are common in all 
construction projects type and are inevitable (Ibbs, et al. 2001). Most variations orders continue to pose a serious 
threat to the construction industry, since they contribute to time and cost overruns, therefore, affecting the contract 
price of the project. Hence variations may have a negative or positive impact on construction projects (Osman et al. 
2009). In addition variations maybe caused by various sources such as: scarcity of resources, environment condi-
tions, involvement of other parties and contractual relations. Furthermore, as a result of these sources the construc-
tion projects may face changes that could delay the project completion time (Clough and Sears 1994). Moreover, the 
impact of variation differs from one project to the other, but it is general accepted that variation can affect construc-
tion projects with unpalatable consequences in time and cost (Ibbs et al. 2001). There are two type of variations, 
which are beneficiary variation and detrimental variations. Beneficiary variations are those variations that bring 
good to the project such as help to improve quality, reduce cost, schedule, or degree of difficulty in the project. Det-
rimental variations are those that reduce owner value or have a negative impact on a project (Ibbs et al. 2001). The 
project team should be able to take advantage of beneficial variations when the opportunity arises(Arain and Low, 
2005). Even if the project is planned well from the onset, it is likely that there will be changes to the scope of the

5. Naming of components of the cost impact of variation order on construction perfor-
mance 
5.1 Components 1: project cost 
The factor 1 encountered 57.933% (Table 6) of the total variance of the cost impact of variation order on construc-
tion performance which was valid. Factor 1 suggested that variation orders has an impact on project cost toward 
construction performance. The following clearly suggest that variation orders have an impact on the cost of a project 
and this VO’s may increase communication expenses; unplanned site meetings; labour during the waiting time; trav-
elling expenses; expenses of idle plant machines; material charges to affected task; head office and site charges. Ta-
ble 7 represent the following variables D16.13; D16.11; D16.15; D16.12; D16.14; D16.6; D16.10. 
5.2 Components 2: Site cost 
Table 6 represented component 2 which has been named site cost due to variation order and encountered 10.937% of 
the total variance which was valid. Factor 2 suggest that site cost include standing time costs; increased time related 
charges; overheads costs; inflation costs; rework time costs; management time increase; changes to cash flow and 
loss of earnings; timing effect (can miss project delivery deadlines). Site cost can cripple a project and make a huge 
loss when not managed very well. Factor 2 defined the following variables D16.3; D16.4; D16.5; D16.7; D16.2; 
D16.9; D16.8 and D16.1. 
 
5.3 Component 3: Indirect cost impact on performance 
Table 6 represented component 3 which encountered 8.154% of the total variance on the indirect cost impact 
on performance due to variation orders which was valid. Indirect cost impact drain the project slowly if not tackled 
as soon as possible. Factor 3 suggest that indirect cost caused by variation orders may include cost for redesign; 
change in cash flow; cost of administration of the variation order; loss of productivity; litigation-related cost in case 
dispute arise due to variation order. Factor 3 defined the following variables D17.3; D17.1; D17.4; D17.2; D17.5. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Vo’s are a worldwide phenomenon, and the consequences include friction among clients, consultants, and contrac-
tors. Most variations orders have a negative impact on construction performance which creates a significant finan-
cial risk to clients. Also vo’s may cause painful experiences if they are not accounted for and adjudicated properly 
by the client quantity surveyor, furthermore, if vo’s are not properly managed may give rise to costly disputes be-
tween contractor and client. The findings above clearly shows that variation orders indeed have negative impact on 
the overall project cost, site cost and indirect cost. Therefore, vo’s must be minimized to ensure a health, smooth 
operation of a project. Proper planning of project is highly recommended since frequent occurrence of vo’s can af-
fect the overall quality of works

Abstract 
Production management in an industry shapes the foundation of the industry. Proper policies and planning assists 
organizations are inefficiently converting inputs or raw materials into the required outputs or products. A proper 
production process also ensures that the products are produced to the specifications required in amounts, demands, 
and minimum cost. The Plastic and Rubber Manufacturing Industry in Nigeria is an industrial sector that produces 
and delivers large intermediate products. The production of these vital products like films and packaging materials for 
the food industry is very significant to the wellbeing of the consumers in Nigeria. The manufacturing industry used as 
a case study comprises construction, farming, customer products, automotive, and gadgets. This paper assesses the 
design principle and Policy of production management in Nigeria using a food packaging company as a case study. 
Due to the increased demand and growth in Nigeria's plastic and rubber manufacturing industry. It gives a detailed 
explanation of challenges faced by proposed solutions. It concludes on the effectiveness of production due to the 
present principles and policies being used in Nigeria.

Conclusion 
Good production management policies and principles have helped achieve the long-term success of production 
industries in Nigeria. Plastic and rubber manufacturing industries use well-tailored and properly planned production 
systems. However, there is a need for legal policy development from the Government of Nigeria to oversee operational 
management in the packaging industry. Also, the need for the strategic development of this sector because of its 
importance to life and environmental pollution. This should be done through a deliberate policy to encourage the 
production of films locally. This paper has assessed and shown the effect of design principles and production 
management policies on an organization's performance in Nigeria. The results indicate that production management 
determines performance. Without an appropriate structure in place, the organization has a high chance of failure.

Abstract 
 
Worsening environmental degradation, depletion of fossil fuels reserves, and fuel price volatility have led to 
increased concerns about getting adequate energy to power the rapidly growing industrial sector and other uses. 
The cost of energy is a major contributor to the rising cost of production and a source of worry to both the 
producers and consumers alike. Investigation into devising sustainable, accessible, and affordable energy 
sources to power the manufacturing sector and other consumers has engaged the attention of researchers and 
other stakeholders in recent decades. The current research, therefore, investigates techniques for ensuring 
sustainable energy consumption in the Industry 4.0 era. Results show that effective implementation of energy 
saving, cost reduction, and green manufacturing measures will lower energy costs, benefit the environment and 
result in a high return on invested capital. The application of novel intelligent technologies like cyber-physical 
systems, industrial internet of things, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, smart metering, and other 
components of Industry 4.0 will contribute to achieving sustainable energy utilization in the manufacturing 
sector. Going forward, more targeted investigations are required to cultivate realistic and implementable models 
for achieving affordable, environmentally benign, and sustainable energy for the manufacturing sector.  
 
Keywords  
Industry 4.0, sustainable energy, cost-saving, green manufacturing, intelligent technologies. 
 
1. Introduction  
The perceived depletion of fossil oil reserves, worsening environmental concerns, and the high and erratic cost 
of fossil-based fuels have made the continuous search for sustainable and environmentally friendly energy 
alternatives more imperative. The global industrial energy consumption that was 238.9 quadrillion British 
thermal units (Btu) in 2018 became 240.2 quadrillions Btu in 2020 and has been predicted to become 257.5 
quadrillions Btu, 283.4 quadrillions Btu, and 316.7 quadrillion Btu by 2030, 2040, and 2050 respectively 
(Statista 2021) (Figure 1). The industrial sector, comprising iron and steel, chemical and petrochemicals, food 
and tobacco, paper and pulp, machinery, emitted 24.2 % of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of 49.4 
billion tonnes CO2eq in 2016 (Ritchie and Roser 2020) (Figure 2). In 2018, the industrial sector consumed 37 % 
(157 EJ) of total global final energy and emitted 24 % of global emissions (8.5 GtCO2) despite the deployment 
of renewable fuels and other low-carbon processes pathways (IEA 2020). In the United States, an industrialized

4. Conclusion  
Evolving inexpensive and ecologically benign energy to power the manufacturing sector is a task that must be 
accomplished to the benefit of social and economic development. In this study, we have established the 
inevitability of low cost and readily available energy for the manufacturing sector, especially in the Industry 4.0 
era. To have adequate and sustainable energy for the industrial sector, energy saving, energy cost reduction and 
the deployment of green manufacturing techniques are paramount. The application of energy management, 
energy sustainability, waste reduction and conversion, reduction in energy consumption, energy audit, emission 
reduction, and behavioural change are key issues to achieve sustainable energy for the manufacturing sector. 
The deployment of AI, AVR, CPS, IIoT, data analytics, robotics, cloud computing, smart metering, and other 
intelligent technologies to back up the infrastructure for Industry 4.0 will enhance this process.  
 
Advanced manufacturing techniques such as additive manufacturing, lean manufacturing, green manufacturing, 
rapid prototyping manufacturing, and nanomaterials should be employed and implemented. Employees must be 
encouraged and motivated to embrace energy conservation measures and key into other energy saving 
techniques to complement the management vision for energy sufficiency. Going forward, more targeted

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this project was to develop an automated coal mine methane control system for methane gas extraction 
from active and abandoned coal mine roofs, the lightest gas in coal mines. Zimbabwe has the richest deposits of 
methane gas in coal beds in Southern Africa, which accumulates into the underground coal mines during mining 
operations and abandoned underground coal mines. Almost 50% of the energy expended in coal mines goes to the 
ventilation system to ventilate the accumulated explosive gas which is also a source of clean energy. Due to the lack 
of cost-effective technology to capture and fully harness this coal mine methane gas, its accumulations are resulting 
in 10+% downtime which is a huge loss to coal mining companies such as Hwange Colliery in Zimbabwe. Analysis 
of methane gas behavior in terms of emission and accumulation was done, circuit designing, conceptual modeling, 
simulations, and 3D modeling. A system was developed which could capture methane gas through a suction process. 
A model of the system was developed and tested which could detect, monitor, and extract coal mine methane gas. 
This project is recommended for methane gas extraction inactive underground and abandoned underground coal mines 
in Zimbabwe and Sub-Saharan Africa and right page margins and justified.

1. Introduction 
Methane is a natural gas that is formed under very high temperatures and pressures, due to the decomposition of 
organic matter. During the coalification process, the deeply buried organic matter is subjected to extreme conditions, 
and coal and methane are formed. The deeper the organic matter, the higher the coal rank which means the carbon 
content in coal will be increased as well as the quantity of methane formed. Zimbabwe has above 24 billion tonnes of 
coal reserves in the Hwange region of the country, which are currently the major source of fuel for thermal power 
generation plants as well as many industrial steam generation processes in the country, which is more than the rest of 
SADC region, Figure 1. According to Norman Mukwakwami, Zimbabwe’s gas reserves in Hwange and Lupane 
regions have over 800 billion cubic of methane gas per square kilometer (Mukwakwami 2013).

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers standards (ASME) are applied in the vessel design, Section 3 Division 
1 of Dot 3AA for Compressed Natural Gas Vessels (CNG). The vessel material selection is based on the functionality 
requirements and the conditions in which the vessel is supposed to operate in. After all, the constraints are loaded 
including the atmospheric conditions, pressure, and temperatures of the locations thus a maximum of 60 degrees 
Celcius and 1 atm. They were considered as the external conditions during simulation. The American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers satisfied two types of carbon steel of materials for storage of compressed natural gases thus 
A516 Grade 70 and ASME SA516 Grade 70. 
 
5. Recommendations 
 
The underground coal mining operations can resume if this system is adopted this can result in the extraction of high-
quality coal and a high source of clean energy (methane gas).  Hwange Colliery currently is fully engaged in surface 
coal mining operations only. Shangani Energy Exploration has been extracting methane gas and its records reviewed 
that the methane gas being pumped out has a purity level of over 97 %. Underground coal mines will create more 
employment opportunities for Zimbabweans as well as aid the shortage in electricity/energy supply (supply is 
1400MW whilst the demand is 2400MW).  The emission of coal mine methane is not constant it fluctuates and this 
system can still operate at low costs due to the design of three different sized pumps for gas suction purposes. The 
impacts of the projected 10% downtime from Talkington’s research to Hwange Colliery operations can also be 
minimized.  
The coal mine extraction system can be improved in many various ways for effective gas capture and efficiency in 
providing real-time-based data of mine gas concentrations: 
i. Enhanced sensitivity methane gas sensors, specifically standalone sensors which cannot be affected by mine 
operations disturbances. 
ii. Retrieval of coal mine goaf gas? emitted gasses on the coal mine flow. 
iii. More advanced methane gas purification processes are cost-effective. 
iv. A SCADA system monitors all the commands before being executed and can cover the whole mining 
operations. 
v. An adjustable ventilation system that can concentrate on high percentages of accumulated mining areas. 
vi. Introduction of low methane gas percentages based steam engines which can utilize captured ventilation 
methane gas at Hwange Colliery. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The developed concept which can detect, control and extract methane from underground coal mines can be 
successfully applied in Hwange. The high methane gas emissions being recorded by Shangani Energy Exploration

environment conditions such as high temperature, dusty and humid which ensures efficient operation and control of 
the methane gas. The detection system, MQ4 sensor will ensure the safety of the coal miners with the help of the alarm 
signals which provide real-time based mine conditions. The system also has a switch to the machinery power supply 
which shuts down all the equipment during emergencies.

Abstract  
 
The high level of medical malpractice has a negative impact on patients with a very serious risk of loss. One of the 
causes of medical malpractice is an error in carrying out medical actions because knowledge about medical actions 
such as the surgical process comes from theories and concepts not on actions on real objects, even if they are carried 
out on real objects, they are limited to high costs. Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-
world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual 
information. The purpose of this research is to build a mobile learning model with augmented reality technology for 
medical personnel to reduce practice malls. The research method uses a qualitative approach through literature 
review and observation.

Abstract  
 
Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, face-to-face interactions are prohibited by the government, pushing various 
institutions to shift from the traditional to the online style of teaching. However, the question is whether online 
learning is as effective as the traditional learning mode. This research explores the learning experience and current 
issues within engineering education. It compares the learning experience between traditional learning and the 
enriched virtual mode of learning in Introduction to Engineering. The researchers conducted the study at the 
University of Santo Tomas, where they identified two groups of students. The control group consists of students 
from the traditional learning method, and the experimental group consists of students from the enriched virtual 
mode. The researchers used the Mann-Whitney-U test to see if there is a significant difference between groups under 
the factors chosen by the researchers that affect the learning experience. The main findings of the research state that 
there is no significant difference between the control and experimental groups in learning effectiveness, student 
performance, and student confidence. Researchers found a significant difference between the two groups in the two 
dependent variables, student satisfaction and faculty interaction. The study concluded that online learning is as 
significant as traditional learning methods and is even superior to the traditional method in some factors used in the 
study. Lastly, the researchers recognize that online learning can be adapted as the learning tool used in delivering

1. Introduction 
Higher Education is critical for students to prepare for global citizenship, develop a sense of well-being, and foster 
personal and social responsibility (Aragoni 2019). One of the fields of higher education includes Engineering. 
Engineering Education focuses on providing societal growth by systematically applying both science and 
mathematics. The application of engineering education helps create new products, economic growth, and human 
development associated with technological advancements. Innovations necessitating scientific and technological 
knowledge are part of the processes that enable new markets to emerge and speed growth (Cabaces 2018). 
 
Furthermore, Cabaces elaborated that with the fast-paced changes in technology, there is a need to update 
engineering education to keep up with these changes. Thus, educational guidelines are proposed and issued to 
develop an outcomes-based education (OBE) system. This is not the traditional education system wherein the 
instructor lectures, and students' learnings are assessed mainly through examinations. This system will enhance 
students’ ability to work efficiently and effectively with other people, solve complex problems, and learn 
independently (Moore et al. 2017).

Abstract 
 
Education in higher education requires extensive knowledge exploration to increase students' knowledge which is 
not enough to be obtained through e-learning provided by universities alone. Collaborative learning has the potential 
to increase students' knowledge through online and onsite interactions with sources of knowledge from outside the 
institution. Therefore, integration between campus and knowledge sources from outside the campus will maximize 
student knowledge. The purpose of this research is to create a model that integrates the Learning Management 
System with the concept of collaborative learning to support and maximize student learning in higher education. The 
research method uses a qualitative approach through a literature review about the weaknesses of LMS and the 
potential of collaborative learning as well as observing student learning activities in higher education.

Abstract 
 
Considerable effort and resources are being devoted to infrastructure development in many developing economies. 
Unfortunately, many of these mega projects remain ideas for many years, some abandoned at different stages of 
completion and the few that were completed were achieved with significant time overrun. The uncompleted projects 
have contributed to the increase in infrastructure deficit. Therefore, the effective management of the time component 
during the execution of capital infrastructure projects significantly increases the possibility of completing parts of or 
the complete project on schedule, thus reducing the negative effects of inflation. In this regard, it is imperative to 
explore a functional approach on how to achieve the execution of capital projects on schedule. The multiple sites 
case study strategy of qualitative research, using comparative analysis, was adopted to examine how building and 
highway improvement projects were executed within their time schedules. The findings revealed that the concept of 
phase development and fragmentation, using multiple contractors, was used for the execution of the projects. The 
two projects were executed within the time schedule, reducing the infrastructure deficit, ameliorating the negative 
effects of inflation, and resulting in value for money for the client.

1. Introduction 
The effectiveness of infrastructure delivery is influenced by many factors, which include, but is not limited to the 
procurement method, the mode of execution, competency in planning and management of the execution process, and 
availability of adequate resources. However, focusing on the mode of execution, if the concept of phase 
development and fragmentation is appropriately crafted into the execution of the proposed capital project, the 
approach holds the potential of the timely completion of the projects, reducing the incidence of abandoned projects 
and infrastructure deficit. This approach also enhances the end-user’s satisfaction, the effective use of resources, 
ameliorating the negative effects of inflation and ensuring that the client receives value for the money invested in the 
project (Watermayer 2014). Ameliorating the negative effects of time overrun in capital development projects has 
been a major concern for infrastructure project stakeholders. It is helpful to consider adopting the concept of phase 
development and fragmentation (among other prospective solutions), to ameliorate the negative effects of time 
overrun during the execution of capital infrastructure projects. Adopting this concept allows the effective use of 
available project funds and reduces the negative effects of inflation. The phase that is completed and put to use, 
serves the need of end-users and provides a possible source for revenue generation. During the operation of the 
completed phase any lapses observed should be noted and used to improve the development of subsequent phases.

303",,"economy have not been completed for functional use and so much money has been tied down or wasted. The 
synthesis of information from literature shows that many of the capital infrastructure projects in Africa were 
executed at considerable time overrun, several of them are at ridiculously low level of performance after many years 
and some have been abandoned completely, amplifying the challenges of infrastructure deficit.  
 
This research demonstrated that the use of the concept of phase development and fragmentation in the execution of 
capital infrastructure development holds the potential of completing parts of the whole project within a reasonable 
time and making effective use of the project funds. The prospects of completing a typical construction project are 
higher when using the multi-contractor setting than in the single contractor scenario. The single contractors work at 
their own pace, but any contractor working as one among many, indirectly practices internal benchmarking and 
healthy competition with one another. Achieving the project timeline, schedule or milestone is very important in any 
construction project. Although contractors provide timelines during tender, many of them, especially the single 
contractors, do not follow through during construction. Depending on the procurement system adopted, the 
relationship between the PET members and the project sponsors or client, may influence the capability of the project 
manager to enforce compliance. However, the ‘self-regulation’ principle inherent in the multi-contractor approach 
assists the contractors to keep to their timelines. In addition, the steady progress achieved by the contractors allows 
them to draw proportionately from the project fund, ensuring that payments made are in line with the work progress, 
reduce the negative effects of inflation, and provide value for money.  
 
As shown in the two projects used for this research, the phases identified for execution were completed within the 
time schedule, through the fragmentation of the phases into smaller lots where the contractors worked 
simultaneously. They achieved their individual timelines and ultimately the whole project was completed on 
schedule. The application of this concept, therefore, has the potential of reducing the occurrence of delays in the 
execution of construction projects, abandoned projects and ameliorates the effects of time and cost overrun. It thus 
allows a client to make judicious use of allocated or borrowed funds. This research recommends that the concept of 
phase development and fragmentation be adopted contextually for the execution of all infrastructure projects in the 
engineering and the built environment industry.

Abstract 
 
The objective of the manufacturing industry is to produce quality and quantity of goods to satisfy existing customer 
base, expand market sphare, remain competitive and profitable. However, achieving these ideals depend largely on 
the reliability of the machines in the production line. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the impact of machine 
reliability on production and profiability in a manufacturing industry by analysing and interpreting the operational 
information in the computerised maintenance management system (CMMS) database.This research adopted the 
principle of action research, involving a two-year longitudinal analysis of the operational information in the database 
of the machines in the production line of Adcock Ingram Critical Care (AICC) and benchmarking the same with that 
of Adcock Ingram Health Care (AIHC), a similar pharmaceutical industry. It focused on how AIHC used the factors 
of total breakdowns, total down time, mean time between failure (MTBF) and the mean time to repair (MTTR) to 
improve on the reliability of machines in their production network. The analysis was complemented with interviews 
of participants from inter-related units of the same industry. The findings revealed that in all the areas of 
measurement in 2017, the machines in the production line of AICC performed below the benchmark of AIHC. 
However, in 2018, there were appreciable improvements, due to the practice of preventive maintenance. Therefore, 
the introduction of appropriate CMMS in maintenance operations, including the detailed analysis of operational 
information and benchmarking, provides a useful learning curve to improve on the reliability of machines in the 
production line of manufacturing industries.

315",,"achieved in 2017. Thus, continuous improvements in MTBF and MTTR resulted to reduction in the frequency of 
breakdowns, duration of down time and ultimately improved on the reliability of the machines in the production 
line.  
 
Furthermore, the analysis, presentation and interpretation of result facilitates effective communication with all 
relevant stakeholders, elicite collaboration from other departments, provides information for timely decision making 
by senior management. The modest improvements achieved, through this exercise, provides encouragement to the 
maintenance unit to pursue the adoption of other maintenance best practices, including RCM.  
 
It can be concluded that the analysis of operational information of machines in the production line in the database 
serves as a catalyst for identifying the influence of machine reliability on productivity and profitability of the 
manufacturing industries. This research recommends that AICC should have dedicated personnel, at the tactical 
level of leadership, to conduct quarterly analyses of the operational history for discussion within the maintenance 
unit, along with other stakeholders and communicated with senior management. Further research efforts should be 
dedicated to study the operations in AICC over a longer period to validate these findings or identify other additional 
factors suitable for the improvement of machine reliability in the production network.

Abstract  
 
The outbreak of Coronavirus (Covid-19) and the associated government containment measures to address the problem 
forced many universities across the globe to adopt or deepen their online teaching and learning activities. As a result, 
assessments that ordinarily follow pedagogical approaches of face-to-face classroom-based practices and procedures, 
moved to online variants -- a novel practice for many academics across disciplines. Expectedly, such shifts have 
ignited debates among scholars about assessments quality and academic integrity. From both academic and students’ 
perspectives, the aim of this paper is to review systematically, and critically evaluate and understand the relationship 
between online assessments and performance outcomes in safeguarding quality and academic integrity. Applying a 
qualitative approach, data were collected through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) framework, from Experiential 
Research Method (ERM) and from Informal Shared Conversations (ISC) with postgraduate students. It is hoped that 
the findings of the study will contribute positively towards efforts to strengthen existing ethical values in policy and 
practice within the academia.

1. Introduction 
The outbreak of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in 2020 caused an unprecedented global disruption of the day-to-day 
running of previously routine activities of educational institutions. The immediate impact of the pandemic was the 
related lockdown and social (physical) distancing restrictions, which ensured the closure of primary, post-primary and

of educational activities became one of the top priorities in most countries – thus, the sudden shift from the traditional 
classroom face-to-face pedagogy to alternative modes of digitally enhanced virtual teaching and learning, and 
assessments. The South African government’s request that learning institutions should shut down as a precautionary 
measure and move to online delivery of services resulted in universities initiating adjustments of course plans, course 
contents, and assessment design and implementation, but also on other pertinent matters such as course delivery 
method. The Department of Higher Education urged institutions nationwide to activate digitals platforms to ensure 
continuation of teaching and learning. According to Landa et al., (2021), universities in South Africa employed a

Abstract  
 
This study aims to investigate the impacts of the internet usage and bank account ownership on the IYCF practices 
in Indonesia. The data used was the results of the 2017 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey. The unit of 
analysis was children aged 6–23 months comprising 4,880 children. The dependent variable was the IYCF practices. 
The main independent variables were the internet usage and bank account ownership. The control variables were the 
age and sex of the children, mother’s education, household wealth, and place of residence. The results of the study 
showed that mother’s internet usage and bank account ownership had significant positive impacts on the IYCF 
practices. Children aged 6–23 months whose mothers ever used the internet and had a bank account were more 
likely to be well fed. Older children, children with better educated mothers and better household wealth, and 
children who lived in urban areas were more likely to be well fed. Therefore, the IYCF practices improvement 
program in Indonesia should utilize the internet to inform, educate, and communicate full IYCF practices, empower 
mothers financially, and aim at younger children, children with lower educated mothers and lower household 
wealth, and children in rural areas.

1. Introduction  
Stunting in children under five years old is a major public health issue in many developing countries, including 
Indonesia (President Decree, 2020). The results of the 2018 showed that more than three in ten (30.8%) of under-
five children in Indonesia were stunting (NIHRD, 2019). The stunting prevalence varied greatly across provinces, 
lowest (17.6%) in the capital province, DKI Jakarta, and highest (42.7%) in the geographically spread island 
province, Nusa Tenggara Timur. Therefore, the acceleration of stunting reduction is among the major project of the 
National Midterm Development Plan 2020–2024 (President Decree, 2020). 
 
There are several derivate goals of the second goal in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to end hunger, such 
as poverty alleviation, food security and nutrition improvement, and elevate sustainable agriculture (Sustainable 
Development Goals, 2015). One of the indicators of this Goal is the stunting prevalence among under-five years of 
age children where the intermediate target is a 40% decline in the stunting prevalence during 2012–2025. In 
accordance with this target, Indonesia even targets a higher decline in the stunting prevalence among under-five 
years of age children to14% by 2024 or around eight percent decline annually during 2018–2024 (President Decree, 
2020). 
 
Stunting in children can be caused by several of factors, including poor feeding practices (Steward et al. 2013). 
These include the inability to achieve the basic minimum in terms of food diversity, meal frequency, and the bare 
minimum in terms of suitable nutrition. Individual and societal health both dependent on proper nutrition during 
childhood (Newby et al. 2015). Infant nutrition is essential for children's health and development during childhood, 
and also during adolescence and adulthood. Prior to the age of two, optimal breastfeeding and sufficient

areas. Mothers in the rural areas have limited time to visit health facilities because they usually went to the garden 
from morning to evening in helping their husband who worked in agricultural sector. Therefore, rural mothers did 
not have large opportunity to get adequate information and sharing session between mothers in the villages (Tasnim 
and Dasvarma 2018). In addition, the agricultural sector is vulnerable to the weather and climate’s changes. It 
implies that their income tends to be lower. Therefore, feeding patterns/practices of children in low socio-economic 
groups are limited by their capacity to meet their nutritional needs.  
 
Children from low socioeconomic households and mothers with low education levels generally have unhealthy 
eating habits/patterns, which tend to consume more energy-dense foods than children from high socioeconomic 
groups who generally have a higher intake of fruit and vegetables (Santika et al. 2016). Meanwhile, households with 
a higher wealth index are more likely to have nutritious foods which meet their children's dietary needs (Titaley et 
al. 2019). Compared to children from other socioeconomic groups, children from high socioeconomic groups 
consume more legumes and nuts, dairy products and their derivatives, various types of meat, eggs, fruits, and 
vegetables with vitamin A. They also have a diet consuming fortified foods which contribute greatly to their overall 
nutritional intake, especially in the adequacy of nutritional micronutrients (Santika et al. 2016). These findings 
highlight that the interventions to improve feeding patterns in children must pay attention to the gradient of 
household socioeconomic status. Another thing that needs to be considered is the improvement of the economic 
status of the household to ensure that every child has access and availability to healthy food. In addition, priority for 
nutrition interventions, including IYCF practices, must reach all villages in Indonesia so that the reduction in the 
prevalence of stunting can be accelerated (Trihono 2015). 
 
4. Conclusion  
The results of this study showed that only 42% of children aged 6–23 months in Indonesia were well fed, i.e. 
receiving full IYCF practices. In addition, mother’s internet usage and bank account ownership were found to have 
significant positive impacts on the IYCF practices in Indonesia. Higher odds of being well fed were associated with 
ever use of the internet and having a bank account among the mother’s. Older children, children aged 6–23 months 
whose mothers had better education, who came from wealthier households, and who lived in urban areas had higher 
odds of being well fed.   Based on these findings it is recommended that in order to improve IYCF practices in 
Indonesia, the internet should be utilized in the IYCF practices’ information, education, and communication 
activities, mothers should be empowered financially, and target the program to younger children, children with 
lower educated mothers and lower household wealth, and children in rural areas.

Abstract  
 
During the pandemic, the health sector has taken the lead. This is due to the growing demand for medical equipment 
and medications to treat COVID-19, which has caused the healthcare industry to expand. Manufacturing industry 
developments are inextricably linked to the strength of the supply chain. Inventory management is a vital activity in 
supply chain management since, to fulfil consumer demand, especially during a pandemic like this, medical 
equipment supplies raw materials must be accessible to avoid stockouts, which have a serious effect. Given these 
conditions, further investigation is required. This study aims to create an adequate inventory policy for medical 
items based on characteristics. Inventory policy is defined by categorizing commodities using the ABC and XYZ 
classification methods integrated. Based on the list of products and demand information, these things are categorized 
and prioritized in problem-solving to create improved and effective inventory management techniques.

1. Introduction  
The global outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant influence on many fields of 
life. The pandemic has terrified billions of people in various regions of the world with lockdown and social 
distancing regulations, even though this is done to slow the rate of transmission of the COVID-19 virus. In practice, 
everyone is expected to follow health procedures and provide immunizations to those who fit the criteria. As a 
result, the demand for medical equipment such as syringes, masks, and pharmaceuticals skyrockets. 
 
As during epidemic, the health industry has played a leading role. This is because the growing demand for medical 
equipment and medications to treat COVID-19 has caused the healthcare industry to expand. Industrial sector 
growth is intricately bound to the strength of the supply chain (Natalia 2021). Inventory management is a critical 
component of supply chain management to satisfy customer demand (Kim et al. 2015). In order to meet consumer 
demands, raw material inventory management plays a critical role. Inventory management is the act of planning and 
controlling inventory to balance supply and demand and satisfy customer demands while reducing overall inventory 
investment (Singh and Verma, 2018). According to this definition, inventory is an item offered by the corporation 
that may be utilized to satisfy future demand. 
 
Inventory management necessitates an examination of each item's properties. This is done to decide the best 
inventory policy for each item based on its characteristics. The ABC method (the level of importance of each group 
of goods) and XYZ (demand variation) are used in this study to classify raw materials and components, and the 
relationship between the classification approach and inventory control applied to each of the resulting characteristics 
are proven through performance. The entire system is dependent on the combination of the two (Conceico et al. 
2015; Lolli et al. 2017). Several previous studies discuss inventory management in the health industry. Hovav and 
Tsadikovich (2015) researched the development of an inventory management model in managing vaccine 
distribution. 
 
Meanwhile (Stecca et al. 2016) analyzed network design and drug inventory management. Cappanera et al. (2019) 
analyzed the inventory control system for drugs considering the impact of healthcare stakeholders. Several types of 
research on classification analysis on inventory management with ABC-XYZ have been conducted meanwhile,

351","The characteristics of each raw material and component are derived from the two tables above based on the value of 
investment consumption and variation in their usage. Once this is determined, the firm may decide the best 
inventory policy based on the characteristics of each product. The features are split into nine groups with two major 
categories after merging these two analyses. Classes AX, AY, AZ, BZ, and CZ comprise the first category. This first 
category includes all Z groups with irregular demand kinds, such as having zero demand randomly over a lengthy 
period and having increased and reduced demand at any moment in a relatively short period. According to (Buliński 
et al., 2013; Conceiço et al., 2015), the first category must be based on stock information since it contains high-value 
items with changing demand. The second group includes BX, BY, CX, and CY classes. This group is distinguished 
by the presence of moderate to low-value items and less variable demand, resulting in inventory management carried 
out through periodic inspections (Buliński et al. 2013). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The integration of the accomplished ABC-XYZ analysis makes it easier to manage objects based on the criteria 
chosen. Activities performed by combining ABC/XYZ analysis allow for the identification of the company's goods 
based on the company's finances and the introduction of the amount of demand emergence. Businesses may use 
suitable and optimum strategies to predict inventory problems such as stockouts or missed sales with this 
connectivity. There are nine different categories of raw materials in all (PPSCG; PP; PPM; INKCT; PPHY; ETO30; 
PPHO; ETO80; PIGG) and 17 types of components (BJMI05MLK1; GLY05MLK1; NK24G05MLK1; 
NBLY24G05MLK1; PLJMI05MLK1; CANPT2300G05MLK1; GPT5MLK1; GPT5MLKML1; GPT5MLK1; 
CANPT21G5ML; CANPT22G1ML; CANPT23G3ML; GJMI05MLK1; NPT24G05MLK1; NSM24G05MLK1; 
PLLY05MLK1; CANPT27G005ML) which fall into the first category so that the right inventory policy for these 
products is a policy based on inventory stock information, where inventory reorder points are carried out or take into 
account the minimum limit for the amount of inventory that has been determined. The second category includes 8 
raw materials (EPOXY; SILOIL; ETO90; SOLVENTNH; RCT; SILCOM; PIGV; RFCT) and 2 components 
(GPT05MLK1; CANPT24G05ML). The proper inventory policy for this group is to conduct periodic inspections 
depending on the time established by the firm.

Abstract 
 
This paper discusses the fundamental roles of integrating TVET in Industrial Engineering and Operational 
Management ecosystem towards inclusive, resilient and sustainable growth. It further navigates the dichotomy 
confronted by Africa Technical and Vocational Education and Training ecosystem created by the COVID 19 
pandemic. Technical and Vocational Education and Training ecosystem is depended on pracademic. Migration to 
Technology Enabled Learning is a mammoth task as African countries are constrained by non-availability of 
resources. Compromisation of quality in Higher Education negatively affects industrial development as the two 
are intertwined. Rebuilding and Reconstructing Higher and Tertiary Education in a Transforming and Disruptive 
Environment creates a dichotomy which creates both paralysis and praxis. Bold curricula rethinking, redesigning 
and resetting through consultative processes and elimination of disconnection and dismemberment between 
learning institutions, industry, political ecosystem and the cultural discourse. Generally all engineering disciplines 
have their roots in TVET. Such development require appropriate and relevant demonstrable pracademic and 
transferable practical skills anchored and grounded in TVET. Creative industry is considered one of the most 
dynamic sectors of the world economy, offering innovative potential and growth opportunities for developing 
countries (UN¶s Creative Economy Reports, 2008, 2010, 2013). In 2020 Zimbabwe embarked on educational 
overhaul based on the fulcrum of Teaching, Research, Community Service, Innovation and Industrialization which 
was preceded by enactment of Manpower Planning and Development Amendment number 12 of 2020. The 
researcher will argue that development of a vibrant Technical and Vocational Education and Training ecosystem 
should anchor on sound cultural and traditional discourse that enable participants and practitioners to relive, 
reconstruct and redevelop Technical and Vocational Education and Training ecosystem embedded in Industrial 
Engineering and Operations Management. Industrial Engineering and Operations Management that is grounded 
in cultural and traditional Technical and Vocational Education and Training ecosystem, discourse, dichotomous 
and dissonance is likely to be robust resilient and sustainable. The researchers will employ and deploy both 
quantitative and qualitative research to unpack and unbundle the Philosophy of Integrating Technical and 
Vocational Education and Training Ecosystem into the Dynamics of Industrial Engineering and Operational 
Management for Resilient and Sustainable Economic Development. To mobilize people we need to understand 
and embrace their culture Ban Ki-Moon Former Secretary-General of the United Nations (2013).

1.1 Great Zimbabwe National Monument 
Zimbabwe’s many historical artefacts and standing monuments are a clear demonstration of the resilient and 
sustainable praxis in infrastructural construction that were built then. The architectural designs showed ingenuous 
and intelligent well formatted layout structures. Contemporary engineers remained baffled and mesmerised by 
these centuries’ old infrastructures. Local resources formed the bedrock of all the ingredients for construction. 
The constructions were relevant, appropriate, resilient and sustainable. The Great Zimbabwe ruins, the capital of 
the Queen of Sheba, according to an age-old legend are a unique super-structure and testimony to the Bantu 
civilization of the Shona between the 11th and 15th centuries. The city, which covers an area of nearly 80 ha, was

5.1 Empirical findings  
• 
Africa’s resilient and sustainable infrastructure ecosystem is rooted is foreign centric discourse.  
• 
Most projects are done without community engagement or consultations 
• 
Africa infrastructure is not resilient because it was designed and developed with colonial philosophy and it 
did not take in account demographic projections. 
• 
Most construction projects and mining ventures are given to foreigners who only look at the economic benefit 
to their countries leaving the host country in a poor state.

Resilient and sustainable infrastructural knowledge acquisition is characterised by low conversion, under-
utilisation and mis-utilisation, with limited collaborations and networking.  
• 
Resilient and sustainable infrastructural Knowledge Management System is hampered by lack of Afro-centric 
policies that promote research and investment in resilient and sustainable infrastructure.  
• 
Indigenous Knowledge Systems could play a key determining factor as an enabler and facilitator to the 
acquisition, sharing, networking and generation in resilient and sustainable infrastructural Knowledge 
Management Systems.  
 
5.1.1 Recommendations 
Emanating from the implication of the research study, the researcher make the following recommendations for 
effective and efficient resilient and sustainable infrastructural development.  
• 
Develop clear policies and philosophies that repurpose and support the implementation of national 
resilient and sustainable infrastructural Knowledge Management Systems in Africa embedded in 
Indigenous Knowledge Systems. 
• 
Understand and emphasise practical approaches and solutions to create indigenous resilient and 
sustainable Infrastructural Knowledge Management Systems as a competitive edge.  
• 
Have a holistic approach to capacity building and consultation with communities when it comes to 
building resilient and sustainable infrastructure.  
• 
Acquire appropriate ICT technologies to enable implementation of programs for using resilient and 
sustainable infrastructural. 
 
5.1.2 Way forward  
This study opens opportunities for future research due to limited resources and time. Further research to validate 
the developed model can be explored to determine if there is an optimal interrelationship of indigenous knowledge 
processes when it comes to resilient and sustainable infrastructural in Africa. 
 
5.1.3 Conclusion 
This research study has managed to satisfy the research objectives and come up with findings and 
recommendations. Zimbabwe and Africa need to integrate Technical and Vocational Education and Training and 
Industrial Engineering and Operations Management to reassert the philosophy of resilient and sustainable 
infrastructural development for national reskilling, industrial engineering and technology transfer. Adequate 
budget provisions, public policy orientation, and curricula reorientation must be put in place for resilient and 
sustainable construction. African Governments must institutionalise and embody resilient and sustainable 
infrastructural development that promote and enhance indigenous philosophies.

Abstract 
 
Roads in Nigeria and like any other developing country are hugely plagued with deterioration and damage due to 
excessive traffic beyond design load, environmental conditions and their interactions as well as low budgetary 
allocation for routine/preventive maintenance. In order to address the problems, researchers/practitioners in the 
highway community have engaged in the use of admixtures and waste material to enhance the properties of paving 
materials while reducing the cost of production. This study investigates the suitability of Gum Arabic (GA) also 
known as acacia gum to be used as bitumen modifier in Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA). GA is a natural material 
consisting or hardened sap of various species of acacia. Its glue or binder property makes it a potential material for 
use as a modifier in HMA. In order to determine the performance of asphalt concrete mix containing GA as 
modifier, 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% GA (by weight of bitumen in asphalt concrete mixture) were added at 
bitumen contents of 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5% and 7.5% each. Marshall parameters (stability and flow) and volumetric 
properties of the asphalt mixtures were used to evaluate the performance of GA as modifier and determine the 
optimum GA content. The study revealed that asphalt concrete mixture prepared using 2.5% GA at a bitumen 
content of 6.5% performed better than the control sample (0% GA content) based on the evaluation parameters. This 
can be recommended for use in surfacing of heavily trafficked flexible pavements.

1. Introduction 
Transportation is cardinal in assessing the growth of any country. Highway transport mode in Nigeria, and many 
developing countries, accounts for 95% of all transport movements and this is not without the inevitable 
consequences of pavement failures influenced by material properties, excessive traffic loading and environmental 
factors (Otuoze and Shuaibu, 2017). 
 
Bituminous pavement surface is susceptible to temperature and loading variation because of its viscoelastic and 
possibly plastic properties (Rais et al., 2013). The pavement performance in service is significantly affected by the 
laying temperature of asphalt concrete, which reduces its stiffness. The stiffness of asphalt concrete layers in a 
pavement structure dramatically influences its structural capacity. As the temperature of asphalt increases, the 
stiffness decreases, leaving it less able to withstand wheel load (Cuadri et al. 2014). A decrease in asphalt concrete 
stiffness results in higher stress being transmitted to the base and subgrade layers, thus, affecting the pavement 
performance.  
 
Conventional asphalt pavements lack the mechanical strength, service requirements and longevity to withstand 
heavy traffic loading, varying regimes of temperature loading and distresses induced by climatic and environmental 
conditions (Gökalp, 2021). In addition, the cost of constituent materials that make up the asphalt mixture is another 
problem, thus, prompting the need to incorporate cheaper/waste materials as partial or whole substitutes for the 
convectional materials while maintaining/improving the desirable properties of asphalt mixtures. 
 
Researchers and practitioners in the highway community have long been engaged in the use of substitute materials 
as either partial replacement or modifiers for binder (bitumen) with the objective of improving performance of 
asphalt concrete. A number of polymers and fiber materials such as thermoplastics – ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), 
low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE) and ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) have 
been used in asphalt mix (see e.g., Hu et al. 2018; Nizamuddin et al. 2020; Ansari et al. 2021). Elastomers like

389","Voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) represents the volume of intergranular void space between the aggregate 
particles of a compacted asphalt concrete. This volume includes the air voids and effective binder content, expressed 
as a percent of the total volume of the sample. Figure 8 shows how this HMA design parameter varies with modifier 
content. The initial increase in VMA could be attributed to the increase in viscosity of the bitumen which increases 
the bitumen-film thickness on coated aggregates. After the saturation of the bitumen with modifier (beyond 5%), a 
decrease in VMA is observed (Table 6).

Figure 9 on the other hand, shows the variation of VFB with GA content. Since VFB is largely depended on VMA, 
and has a strong correlation with VIM, it is expected that an increase in air voids (Figure 8) should be accompanied 
by a decrease in VFB since most of the voids in the compacted asphalt are occupied by air. However, requirements 
on VFB are usually put in place to avoid less durable HMA resulting from thin films of binder on the (coated) 
aggregates. 
 
 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this research, the influence of gum Arabic as a bitumen modifier in hot mix asphalt was investigated. Hot mix 
asphalt was prepared according to the Marshall mix design method. Preliminary tests were performed on all 
constituent materials to determine their conformity for use in hot mix asphalt according to relevant standards. The 
tests revealed that all the constituent materials are suitable for use in HMA. 
 
Results on Marshall analysis show that Gum Arabic at lower concentrations increases the stability and reduces flow 
of HMA. This improvement is attributed to increase in viscosity caused by presence of polysaccharide in GA. 
However, at greater concentrations of GA, an excess amount of polysaccharide resulted in decrease in stability and 
increase in flow of HMA samples. On volumetric properties, GA at lower concentrations increases the air voids in 
compacted HMA samples forming stronger lightweight asphalt concrete.  
 
HMA samples prepared with modified bitumen containing 2.5% GA showed superior performance compared to the 
control sample (0% GA content) and satisfy the performance requirements for use in flexible pavement surfacing 
(Table 6).

Abstract 
 
This work presents the results of the evaluation of Sesame Stalk Ash (SSA) used as partial replacement for Ordinary 
Portland Cement (OPC) in concrete. SSA was used to replace OPC by weight ranging from 0 to 20% at intervals of 
5% replacement using the concrete mix ratio (1:2:4). Experimental tests such as setting times, consistency, 
soundness, XRF and slump were carried out to determine the properties of SSA-cement paste and fresh concrete 
respectively. Likewise, compressive strength test was carried out on 100mm cubes after 7, 14 and 28 days curing. 
However, from the result obtained it indicates that both the Initial and Final Setting Time increases with an increase 
in the percentage of Sesame Stalk Ash (SSA). The values of soundness obtained at each replacement levels falls 
within the acceptable limit specified by BS EN 196-3 (1995). Also, XRF conducted on SSA indicate that the content 
of Silica (SiO2) is 11.636  %, Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) is 3.005 % and Ferrous oxide (Fe2O3) is 0.982 % sums up 
to (15.623 %) which is less than the minimum value for a good Pozzolanic material. Therefore, SSA is of low 
Pozzolanic reactivity (ASTM C618, 2008). It was also confirmed from the research that the compressive strength of 
concrete decreases with an increase in SSA content. On the other hand, it increases as the curing age increases. The 
5, 10, 15 and 20 % replacement of cement with SSA respectively gives a compressive strength of 15.55N/mm2, 
9.08N/mm2, 6.00N/mm2, and 5.50N/mm2 at 28 days of curing. However, the 5 % replacement gives the optimum 
compressive strength of 15.55N/mm2.

Abstract 
 
Calabar as the capital of Cross-river is the most populated city in the state. The present water distribution system, 
Cross River State Water Board Ltd(CRSWBL) serves an increasing population of over 605,000 persons and 
more(according to NPC, 2021) posing an increasing water demand. However, there has been no significant 
improvement made to the water distribution network. An extended period simulation was performed on the 
CRSWBL distribution network to evaluate its performance with respect to hydraulic head loss, velocity, 
pressure and nodal demands at different times of the day using WaterCAD and Epanet. According to universal 
standards, a flow rate with a minimum of 0.15litrepersecond (LPS) as well as a pressure head with a minimum 
of 15m and maximum of 70m were used as yardsticks. Areas with flow rates and pressure heads that fell short 
of these standards were noted. Both software used, WaterCAD and Epanet produced nearly the same outputs 
with statistically negligible differences. At the end of the study, it was concluded that the performance of the 
pipe distribution network in Calabar under the current water demand is slightly inefficient in some areas and 
appropriate approaches were recommended.

1. Introduction 
Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) form the connection between the waterworks and distribution system. It 
provides a variety of functions in addition to providing water for human consumption. Piped water is also used 
for washing, sanitation, irrigation, industrial usage, and firefighting. Pipe network analysis is an important 
aspect of distribution systems which are complicated systems consisting of several pumps, reservoirs, valves of 
different kinds, and other appurtenances (Agunwamba 2000). 
The objective of a pipe system is to supply water at an optimum pressure and flow, and networks are 
constructed to meet peak requirements. However, the pressure loss is further affected by the amount of water 
used, the length of the pipe, the gradient, and the diameter of the pipe. The water demand, pipe length, 
gradient, and diameter all affect pressure loss. The pressure-flow relationship is described by a number of 
proven empirical equations, which have been included into network modeling software programs to make 
their solution and use easier (Weber, 1971). Water utilities' primary function is to distribute the needed 
amount of water to individual consumers under sufficient pressure via a distribution network..  
 Water is only available for a few hours each day in most Nigerian cities, the pressure is inconsistent, and the 
water is of poor quality. Intermittent water supply, insufficient pressure, and unpredictable service impose 
both financial and health costs on Nigerian households. Computer-based commercial water distribution

398","5.2 Proposed Improvements 
Proposals were made as road maps for improving on general access to pipe-borne water in the region. 
There is need for CRSWBL to re-evaluate the pipe borne water distribution network of the city.  
This is considering the new discovery of the behavior of the four distribution networks at various 
times in the city.  
 
It is fundamental that concerned administrators are directed by the analytical results showing pipe-
borne water pressure and flow rate inside the network. Likewise, since the pipe borne water 
distribution network is gravity fed, the low water pressure and flow rate issue can be controlled 
through establishment of electric pump stations in regions found to have low pressure.  
These pumps would help to push water up to areas that experience water cuts and discontinuity 
because of low pressure and increment of the flow rate of the water when needed. Along these lines, 
pressure breaks should likewise be introduced on the observed high pressure lines. This is to check 
damage of pipe networks from outrageous pressure.  
 
There is additionally need for explicit examinations on the conduct of water conveyance not just in 
Calabar city, yet in other Nigerian urban communities that have functional distribution systems 
 
6. Conclusion 
Recognizable from the analysis is the way that regions with low water pressure had high elevations, 
with cases around Ikot Effanga zone where some pipe intersections were laid on elevations higher 
than the height of the EWT. In a gravity fed distribution network, regions with such heights inside 
the network would probably encounter discontinuity and intermittency in water supply. Additionally, 
regions with the capability of pipe network infrastructural damage from water hammer instigated by 
high pressure were realized. The extended period simulation also mapped the flow activity of the 
water network inside the city. Perceptions from the outcomes likewise showed that there were 
altogether significantly more pipes with flow rates lower than 0.15 LPS at early afternoon in all the 
distribution zones, when water use is expected to be minimal or nearly insignificant.  
 
A number of pipes in the system were inadequate resulting in very low velocities at several points in 
the system where nodal demands were substantially low as well. This is responsible for the enormous 
pipe water quality reduction and blockages in the distribution system thereby reducing the general 
system performance. It was seen that the water distribution system in Calabar city was significantly 
inefficient and requires rehabilitative concerns.

1. Introduction 
Managing a business is a part of the process of planning and organizing a company by using the given resources to 
help achieve the main goals (Clark et al. 2015;  Budiono et al, 2020). The global market is a market operation that 
has crossed national borders (domestic) and is trying to outperform its business in foreign countries. Global markets 
are market activities carried out by global companies that have business strategies in global markets and products 
that must meet global standards in various countries (Dixon and Monk, 2014,  Purba et al. 2020); (Adirinekso et al. 
n.d.). 
 
In the global market, international trade has shown enormous progress based on various opportunities that can be 
seen in business activities such as borderless exchanges and technological advances that ease the trading process to a 
whole new level (S Budiono, 2012); (Papadopoulos and Malhotra, 2007). The easy and fast trading process allows 
the transaction quantity to increase rapidly ( Purba et al. 2020). With the increasing volume of the global market, it 
affects consumer perceptions of a brand because it can affect the number of sales of the company's products 
(Papadopoulos and Malhotra, 2007); (Budiono et al. n.d.). When the level of satisfaction is positive and high with a 
brand, the quantity of products and sales will increase as well.

415","Based on the data processing Table 3 Robust Least Square for Product Sales Performance, the authors can make 
conclusion and discussion. Product sales performance are influenced by independent variables in the model. The test 
results for the proposed model that the results of the value of F-test = 94.09 and probability F = 0.00 smaller than the 
significance level of 5%, we reject the null hypothesis. The independent variable Global Marketing (GB) and 
Consumer Behavioral (CB) simultaneously influence the Product Sales Performance (PSP). Therefore, authors can 
arrange the econometric equation. 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃= 0.94 + 0.35 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺+ 0.42 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶                                                 (7) 
The partial analysis shows that the results of the t-test on the variable Global Marketing (GB) and Consumer 
Behavior (CB) reject the null hypothesis and the direction of the positive coefficient. The value of this positive 
coefficient parameters supports to the hypothesis. Every 1 unit increase in Global Marketing (GB) will increase the 
Product Sales Performance (PSP) by 0.35 level in level Likert scale 5. Every 1 level increase in Consumer Behavior 
(CB) will increase the Product Sales Performance (PSP) by 0.42 level in 5 level Likert scale.  
 
6. Conclusion 
It is clear that Global Marketing (GB) and Consumer Behavior (CB) affect Product Sales Performance (PSP) 
positively and significantly within a tolerance of 5%. Planning and programs for global marketing efforts must be 
carried out with certainty covering all lines from top management to bottom lines. 
 
Because the global market has connected various countries and is increasingly following the dynamics of the times 
lately, companies must be able to control the external environment to gain a competitive advantage. Global 
marketing strategy plays an important role as global business oriented to connect target market segments with 
marketing mix elements. Global marketing orientation includes production, sales, customer, strategic marketing, and 
social marketing. The company must maintain the efficiency and quality of the products produced. Finally, efforts 
are made to integrate and standardize marketing operations across various geographic markets. 
 
Building a real feeling that individuals must have when interacting with the market environment is very important 
for company performance, especially sales. Consumers who can accept and feel they have the product will use the 
goods and services continuously. Companies must create ideas and meet daily needs. Likewise, product buying is 
also considered as a process in building one's attitude towards brands and products so that product sales performance 
increases.

Consumer demand for products from developing countries is more varied for foreign products than for local 
products (Rumengan et al., 2018); (Dwitama, 2021); (Nguyen et al., 2021). Companies worldwide compete to 
become global companies, some of them because of strategic branding (Eisingerich and Rubera, 2010); (Budiono, 
Evanson, et al., n.d.). As competition changes through digital networks, companies will be able to manage brands 
across a wide variety of countries successfully over the world (Fransesca et al., 2016); (Furunes and Mkono, 2019); 
(Taylor et al., 2020). Global brands can be used as a tool that can introduce a company image that reaches a diverse 
target consumer (Budiono, Purba, et al., n.d.). The increasing trend of online shopping and online product reviews 
appearing on the internet and social media will provide various places to share experiences and views (Surjana et al., 
n.d.); (Adirinekso, Purba, Budiono, et al., n.d.). Digital transformation is a big challenge for companies to change 
their marketing strategy to digital form (J T Purba and Panday, 2015); (Panday and Purba, 2015). This strategy also 
impacts interrelated customer brand engagement and customer brand identification (Adirinekso, Purba, and 
Budiono, n.d.); (Budiono, Purba, et al., n.d.);. A relationship between customer brand and customer brand 
identification can create an understanding of the brand relationship with customers. Customer loyalty is considered 
influential to make the company grow and survive. Today's business competition is increasingly competitive 
because every company strives to be the best (J T Purba et al., 2020). With this competition, a company must 
maintain the quality of its products. The company maintains the quality of a product with existing customers, attracts 
new potential customers, and increases the company's sales as well. Because maintaining quality is not easier than 
getting a new one. There are user operating office of market share in 2020 as follow in figure 1.

Abstract  
 
Based on several previous studies, SMEs have several weaknesses, including the lack of knowledge of SMEs which 
has an impact on the lack of ability of SMEs to increase their business scale. Some research also shows that SMEs 
have advantages such as the strength of the SME community. The SME community is a collection of several SMEs 
who have the same interests and one of the advantages of the SME community in the context of knowledge, the 
SME community has a lot of potential knowledge that has not been spread to SME members which will be useful 
for members in the community. The purpose of this research is to build a Knowledge Management System model to 
increase knowledge through the potential knowledge of the SME community. The research method uses a 
qualitative approach through a literature review to identify SME knowledge problems and solutions using an 
information technology approach.

1. Introduction 
 Collaboration is the right strategy in developing a highly coveted business nowadays. Many considerations must be 
made, including tips on choosing reliable and trustworthy partners and work teams (Alonso and Bressan, 2017); 
(Nadeak and Tampil, 2014). Choosing the right partner is the key to the collaboration performance's success (Tan et 
al., 2019); (Purba et al., 2020). Collaboration or partnership is a relationship between a company and other parties to 
fulfill common goals in the principles of cooperation and fairness (Tampil Purba and Panday, 2015); (Venkatesh et 
al., 2016). Collaboration is generally done because of mutual needs. Collaboration grows naturally in the business 
world (Paper et al., 2016); (Hoskisson et al., 1999) because social media is quite often used as a media tool in 
conducting marketing communications.  
 
Utilizing applications available on social media as a communication tool in marketing is not only like using the 
internet or any technology, but this requires a correct communication technique and strategy (Luo et al., 2013); 
(Fitzgerald et al., 2014). The most appropriate strategy currently being used is synergy between a group of

Abstract 
 
The use of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPM) is one way to reduce fertility rates. However, the 
prevalence of LAPM use has decreased, while the use of non-LAPM has increased significantly. The high 
prevalence of short-term contraceptive use increases the dynamics of contraceptive use, including contraceptive 
switching behavior. The switching contraceptive method will reduce unintended pregnancies if switched from a less 
effective way to a more practical approach. This study aims to identify the switching contraceptive methods from 
non-LAPM to LAPM and to study the relationship between quality of family planning services which consists of 
informed choice and Family Planning officer’s visit with switching contraception. The unit of analysis is short-term 
and traditional contraceptive use episodes during the 3-62 months before the survey among women in union age 15-
49. The dependent variable is the duration of the risk period up to the contraceptive switch to LAPM. Based on the 
results of the inferential analysis, it was found that quality of family planning services had a significant relationship 
with contraceptive switching from non-LAPM to LAPM.

1. Introduction  
The growth rate of Indonesia's population has decreased quite significantly since 1980, namely 2.31 percent in the 
1971-1980 period to 1.06 percent in the 2015-2020 period (Badan Pusat Statistik, 2018). The success of controlling 
population growth with a decrease in Indonesia's population growth rate cannot be separated from the success of the 
Family Planning Program so that it has been able to reduce the fertility rate in Indonesia. The fertility rate has 
decreased significantly, namely until 1990, from 5 to 6 children per fertile woman in 1971 to 3 children per fertile 
woman in 1990. However, after a significant decline in 1990, the achievement of the fertility rate tends to slow 
down or stagnant, namely at 2.6 in 2000 to 2012 and only decreased again in 2017, namely 2.4 (BKKBN et al. 
2018). 
 
Family planning plays a role in reducing the risk of maternal mortality during childbirth caused by frequent births 
and too short spacing between births. The results of the International Conference on Population and Development 
(ICPD) in Cairo in 1994 called for family planning services to also be aimed at fulfilling reproductive rights and 
handling reproductive health problems as well as maternal, infant and child health. Family planning is included in 
the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United Nations, Department of Economics, and Social Affairs 
2019). Family planning is on the third goal of ensuring a healthy life and supporting well-being for all at all ages. 
Expanding contraceptive access and ensuring that family planning demands are met by using effective 
contraceptives is one of the target's agendas 3.7 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One of the family planning 
program strategies to reduce fertility is through the long-term contraceptive method (LAPM). LAPM has a higher

452","from health professionals. After obtaining the informed choice, he will make choices regarding the contraceptive 
method to use by following under him and his family and the purpose of his family planning. When a person gets an 
informed choice, he will get information about various contraceptive methods. When they experience side effects 
from the contraception they use and feel uncomfortable, armed with this information will encourage non-LAPM 
contraceptive users to switch to a more effective method, namely the long-acting and permanent method (LAPM). 
 
The status of getting field worker’s visits has a significant effect on the status of contraceptive switching. Visits by 
family planning field officers indicate an interaction between health workers and family planning acceptors. Visiting 
officers has a statistically significant effect on the tendency to change the contraceptive device used. Visits by field 
officers reflect the form of post-service counseling that has had a good impact on changing the use of contraceptives 
to LAPM. 
 
These individual characteristics affect a person's choice of a contraceptive method to use and influence a person's 
decision to continue using a contraceptive method or stop and then not use certain contraceptives or switch to 
another method. The results of the analysis in this study indicate that the decision-maker of contraceptive use affects 
the switching of contraception from non-LAPM to LAPM. The decision made by the husband alone has a negative 
and significant effect on switching contraception to LAPM. Decisions made only by husbands were 0.6 times lower 
than those made by women alone. This study shows that the decision to change the method to LAPM is strongly 
influenced by the consent of the wife. This is probably due to the growth mindset and attitude of a woman where she 
has the initiative and power to make family planning choices and is responsible for her decisions. This high-powered 
woman plays an important role in switching contraceptive. They will tend to change the contraceptive method from 
non LAPM to LAPM. 
 
The decision to use contraception that was taken together had a positive effect on switching contraceptive, but not 
significantly. Decisions made jointly had a 1.63 times greater tendency to switch to LAPM methods compared to 
contraceptive decisions made by only wives. These results suggest that switching contraceptive to LAPM will 
increase when the awareness of a husband to take part in determining contraceptive choices and encourages his wife 
to both to decide to use certain contraceptives increases. The use of LAPM contraception is closely related to its 
level of effectiveness in preventing unintended pregnancy and higher costs than other methods. So when someone 
decides to switch long-term contraceptive methods, they will tend to communicate with their partners before 
switching to LAPM. The higher tendency to use LAPM in those whose decision to use contraception was shared is 
in line with research conducted by Mahendra et al. (2019). The results of research by Mahendra et al. (2019) showed 
that women who had made decisions together with their partners were 2.3 times more likely to use LAPM than 
women who made their own decisions about contraceptive use. 
 
Other literature also shows a significant relationship between the role of partners in decision making to use 
contraceptive methods and their continuation. According to Hidayah and Lubis' research, the husband's support 
influences contraceptive choice and affects contraceptive discontinuation (Hidayah and Lubis 2019). The effect of 
partner support is also in line with the results of a study conducted by Henry-Lee (2001) where the role of partners 
has a major influence on contraceptive use. The partner's participation in this decision-making and the partner's 
consent to the use of contraception is the key to the success of the family planning program (Henry-Lee 2001). 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study shows that the quality of family planning services is a factor that has a significant effect on contraceptive 
switching to LAPM. Family planning officer’s visit and informed choice significantly influence the possibility of 
family planning (FP) acceptor to switch their contraceptive method from non LAPM to LAPM. To encourage the 
switching of contraceptive methods to more effective ways, health workers need to increase visits to FP acceptor 
and increase the provision of informed choices to women who can use contraception. The government also needs to 
encourage more women to participate in empowerment programs, especially for family planning acceptors and 
couples of childbearing age. This is done as an effort to increase the role of women in decision-making about family 
planning use.

Abstract 
 
The structural performance of ballasted railway tracks is adversely affected by the level of degradation of the 
ballast particles. The aggregate particles of the ballast bed undergo gradual degradation which results to an axial 
deformation of the railway track during the service operation. However, the study of ballast degradation has 
been very complex and to date, there has not been a single method that is universally accepted to quantify 
ballast degradation. Hence, in an attempt to adequately quantify the degradation of ballast, this study compares 
the two most common methods used for the evaluation of ballast degradation; Fouling index (FI) and Marsal’s 
index (Bg). The degraded ballast material was prepared in the laboratory using the Los Angeles abrasion (LAA) 
method. The Los Angeles abrasion (LAA) test was conducted eight (8) times continuously on the same sample 
at an interval of 250 turns of the LAA test drum. A Series of sieve analysis was conducted after each test run 
and the changes in ballast gradations were evaluated. Based on the results obtained a strong correlation was 
observed between the two approaches with a coefficient of determination of 99.24%. Hence, both Marsal’s 
breakage index and the fouling index can be used for the evaluation of ballast degradation. However, Marsal’s 
breakage index is recommended due to its ability to give the breakdown of the particle size variations.

1. Introduction  
Ballast bed is one of the most important component of ballasted railway track system, whose deterioration affect 
the structural performance of ballasted railway tracks. The deterioration of the ballast bed leads to failures of the 
track system (Ngo and Indraratna, 2016). Ballast is a non-cohesive granular material that is angular in shape and 
uniformly graded. It is usually placed under and between the sleepers, to provide stability for the sleepers and 
transfer stresses from the sleepers bearing area to the surface of the supporting ground as well as providing rapid 
drainage for the ballasted rail track (Lu and McDowell, 2010). It is used to provide stability, resilience, and 
distribution of stress from the track superstructure to its substructure (Anbazhagan et al., 2012; Danesh et al., 
2018a, 2018b; Ngo et al., 2014; Selig and waters, 1994).  For a ballast layer to perform its designed function 
properly, it must be free from any form of deformations and the voids between its aggregate particles be clean in 
order to drain water at any point in time. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Ballast degrades due to the accumulation of traffic loadings and maintenance activities. Although, the attrition 
of angular asperities of ballast particles begins at the construction stage due to tamping which produce 
pulverized ballast particles. This continues after the railway is open to traffic and subjected to environmental 
conditions that cause ballast degradation and fouling of the ballast voids (Ionescu, 2004). This leads to the 
rearrangement of the particles and reduction in the volume of voids, hence resulting in settlement of the rail 
track system (Boler et al., 2012). Fouling refers to the situation in which the voids in the unbound granular layer 
of the railroad ballast are filled with ballast aggregate broken particles and/or other fouling agents e.g., such as 
coal dust from coal trains wagon spillage and intrusion of subgrade soil (Qian et al., 2017). Fouling is one of the 
fundamental factors that affect the performance of the railroad; it is associated with poor drainage and reduces 
the lateral stability of the rail track system. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) conducted a field 
study to assess railway ballast fouling using petrographic assessment method and reported that ballast particles 
breakage contributed about 75-90% of the fouling material after transporting 300 million gross tones (Chrismer, 
1990). Similarly, Selig and Waters, (1994) stated that ballast particles degradation contributes largely to the 
fouling of the railway ballast layer by an approximate percentage of 76.  However, to assess ballast field 
performance associated with degradation associated with particle to particle attrition of angular asperities and

5. Conclusions  
This paper presents an experimental study on railway ballast degradation evaluation. The ballast particle 
gradations were analysed during the degradation process, from 0-2000 turns at intervals of 250 turns of the LA 
abrasion test drum. Series of sieve analysis were conducted and the changes in ballast gradations were evaluated. 
At the end of the experiment, the following conclusions were drawn. 
 
The preliminary test results showed that the material satisfied all the relevant code requirements and hence, the 
material is suitable for use as ballast material. The ballast degradation in terms of breakage index (𝐵𝐵𝑔𝑔) , and the 
fouling index increases with an increase in the number of LA abrasion drum turns. 
 
 The increase in the ballast degradation is attributed to the chopping off of sharp edges, surface abrasion, and 
breakage of larger particles into smaller sizes.  Based on results obtained from the ballast degradation analysis, 
both Marsal’s breakage index and the fouling index can be used for the evaluation of ballast degradation. 
However, Marsal’s breakage index is recommended due to its ability to give the breakdown of the particle sizes 
variations.

Abstract 
There was a substantial inequality in health status across districts in Indonesia. The purpose of this study was to 
examine the association between health and socioeconomic development and morbidity in district in Indonesia. 
The data used came from the Indonesia Database Policy and Economic Research (INDO-DAPOER) of the World 
Bank. The unit analysis was district. The observation period was 2011–2014. Multiple regression analysis was 
employed to study the impacts of health and socioeconomic development on morbidity in district in Indonesia. 
The dependent variable was the morbidity rate. The health and socioeconomic development variables included 
the time, number of medical doctors, number of health centres and its line services, monthly per capita household 
health expenditure, and access to safe sanitation. The results of the study indicate that, in districts in Indonesia, 
lower morbidity rate was significantly associated with increasing time, higher number of medical doctor, higher 
number of health centres and its line services, higher monthly per capita household health expenditure, and higher 
access to safe sanitation. These results imply that to reduce morbidity rate, the regional governments in Indonesia 
should improve their health and socioeconomic development.

Abstract 
 
Processes are developed with activities that should be conducted to reach a set goal. There is no perfect process, and 
any process at a later stage will need to be improved to keep up with the time and the technology. Business Process 
Management (BPM) is essential for any process for the management, monitoring and improvement of the developed 
process. There are different types of business process management models that one could adopt for process 
enhancement. Drone approval process in South Africa has challenges regarding the implemented processes of the 
drone regulation. Challenges involve delays and there is a call by the drone industry to amend the regulation. This 
study explores six core elements and life cycle business process management models. The two BPM models were 
used to guide the development of the business process model to help improve the drone regulation in process in 
South Africa.

1. Introduction  
A definition by South African Bureau of Standards (2015), process is a set of interconnected activities that uses 
inputs to produce an intended result. Sujova and Marcinekova (2015) define process management as a systematic 
visualization, measurement, and improvement of business processes by applying principles and methods of process 
management to allow continual process evaluation. According to Dumas et al. (2013), example of processes in 
organizations may include procure-to-pay, order-to-cash, issue-to-resolution, quote-to-order and application-to-
approval. The authors define application-to-approval process as when someone applies for an approval and ends 
when the approval in question is either granted or denied. Furthermore, this type of process is normally associated 
with government agencies where a person applies for a specific permit and be granted. Application to approval 
process type relates to South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) process, because SACAA process involves 
in issuing of drone licenses and permits where a person could be approved or denied. 
 
The approval process includes Certificate of Registration (CofR), RPAS Operating Certificate (ROC), RPA Letter of 
Approval (RLA), RPAS Maintenance Technician (RMT), Remote Pilot License (RPL). Commercial, corporate and 
non-profit drone operators are required to additionally apply for RPAS Operator certificate (ROC) including the 
operation specifications. The ROC process involves five phases of certification process, which are pre-application, 
formal application, documentation evaluation, demonstration and certification. South African Civil Aviation 
Authority (2015) describes ROC’s five phases as follows: 
a) Phase 1 - Pre-application: applicant makes contact and complete “Letter of Intent”. The applicant will be 
guided on the entire five-phase Process.

471","Process goals are determined and measured and ensure that they are achievable. Decision-making plays an important 
role in a process during this step. Decision making is based on the analysis of information and data (SABS, 2015).  
 
Third step focuses on (People) in an organization. This paper advises that personnel should be assigned with roles 
and responsibilities to ensure an effective process. Roles and responsibilities assignment in a process ensures smooth 
communication flow between roles to provide decision-making platform, which helps to avoid unstructured 
escalation during disputes (vom Brocke and  Mendling 2017). Equipping personnel with sufficient resources such as 
training and education is vital to ensure effective business process.  
 
Fourth step is organizational (Documentation). Processes should be documented to avoid discrepancy and ensure 
consistency. Documented process helps organizational personnel in their daily work as well as training to new 
employees on how to execute their job to delivery same results with consistent quality (vom Brocke and Mendling 
2017). All applicable standards should be followed and conform to. This study advises that all stakeholders should 
be involved during this step to be aware of the documented process.  After the process documentation, the next step 
is to embed the improved process. Improved process helps to clarify and provide information about the process 
(vom Brocke and  Mendling 2017). 
 
Fifth step involve in the business process model is (Execution). Once a process has been re-designed and 
documented, the next stage is implementation and execution of the process.  Rosemann and vom Brocke (2015) 
define the implementation and execution step as a method to transform process models into workable business 
process using related methods for process execution. It is essential to have monitoring and controlling tools to 
ensure that the implemented process is meeting the intended objectives.  
 
Management is the last step of the process model. This step is about ensuring that the re-design and implemented 
process is well managed. Continually supervision and review of the process is vital to ensure that the documented 
process is followed. Responsive to change should also be measured and ensure that all impacted understand the 
changes. Review of process involves determination of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the process to meet 
the established objectives (SABS 2015). Top management should be involved in an improved process and 
continually received feedback regarding the performance. Senior management and executives should demonstrate 
the level of commitment and attention to process management and processes (Rosemann and vom Brocke  2015).  
Many business process models have been developed in the academic environments to fit a certain problems being 
investigated. Like drone industry, process models can be used to monitor and improve while the industry is 
evolving. Process model recommended in this paper can be adopted or modified to fit another any problem. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The purpose of this study was to develop a process model to help improve the drone regulation process. The factors, 
which affect the growth of drones including the regulations in South Africa and other countries, were identified in 
this study through literature review. Two process models were also identified namely; BPM life cycle and six BPM 
core elements for the development of the BPM. Several elements of the Business Process Management were 
highlighted to improve the drone regulation in South Africa. Elements related to this study were selected from the 
BPM core elements and BPM life cycle elements, and thereafter combined and illustrated as a business process 
model to be used for drone regulation improvement in South Africa. Business process management models need to 
be continually improved to keep up with the new ways to do things. The business process model recommended in 
this study can be employed to any process that has challenges. This research will contribute to South African 
research and literature in drones since there are few research in this environment. More concepts development in this 
field are essential to build knowledge that will be used for reference in the future.

Abstract  
 
Eco-innovation is quickly gaining traction to achieve the goal of long-term sustainability in the built 
environment. This is due to its capacity to reduce the environmental impacts of our production modes, improve 
nature's resistance to environmental challenges, and achieve more efficient and responsible use of natural 
resources while building infrastructure. This study used bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review to 
assess current state research on eco-innovation in the built environment to identify established and emerging 
research subjects for future study. The systematic research review we used in our study has not been grasped or 
assessed by other researchers on this topic. Firstly, based on our methodology, the systematic review identified 
84 publications raised from scientific journals, including literature from 2012. Twenty-six publications were 
used after inclusion criteria were followed. According to our findings, 2021 produced the most articles and 
citations. China is the leader in publications and citations, and eco-innovation research in the built environment 
can be classified into five clusters. The research identified various limits that may allow new academics and 
practitioners to investigate Eco-innovation in new ways. Because most practitioners and policymakers are 
unfamiliar with this form of research, many remain theatrical and conceptual. Instead of focusing solely on 
opinion, future studies should focus on practical applications.

1. Introduction 
The built environment consumes large amounts of raw materials and has high energy consumption (Zabalza 
Bribián et al., 2011). This is because the generation of goods and services is highly dependent on natural 
resources. It is estimated that half of the total nonrenewable resources consumed is spent on engineering and the 
built environment. The construction sector consumes 60% of all extracted raw materials globally. Despite 
accounting for a small portion of the total building cost, building materials such as glass, steel, and concrete 
consume a significant amount of energy during manufacturing, transportation, and installation processes 
(Hazarika and Zhang, 2019). It is common knowledge that existing production and consumption systems have 
unsustainable socioeconomic and environmental consequences. In short to long term, achieving advanced 
environmental, social, and economic sustainability has become a significant societal demand and a big challenge 
for the industrial sector (Freire, 2018). Increased environmental pressure and support for modernisation have 
made innovation one of the most important tools for businesses to achieve long-term success. Combining 
environmental sustainability and innovative concepts would promote innovative actions that prioritise 
environmental concerns while promoting innovations and improvements in construction and building projects. 
Eco-innovation (EI) refers to the outcomes of such innovation (Isa and Abidin, 2021). 
 
Eco-innovation is defined as the development or implementation of new (or significantly improved) products 
(goods and services), processes, marketing methods, organisational structures, and institutional arrangements 
that, with or without intent, improve the environment in comparison to relevant alternatives(Isa et al., 2019). 
Improved processes, products, and organisational practices that mitigate or eliminate negative environmental 
impacts are examples of eco-innovations (Klewitz et al., 2012). Eco-innovation can boost productivity, but it 
necessitates a set of conditions for the processes to provide the desired outcomes (Geng et al., 2021). Eco-
innovation research has been conducted to examine its theoretical foundations, alternative definitions, and how 
business models assist eco-innovation (Vallet et al., 2016). This study aims to discuss trends and ideas in eco-
innovation research. The following is a breakdown of the paper's structure. Section 2 explains the methodology; 
Section 3 presents the analysis results. Section4 presents the discussion. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion, 
limitations and future research.

policymaking (Arampatzis et al., 2016). 
 
4.3 Cluster 3 
The main keywords found in this cluster were a competitive advantage, design, innovation, life-cycle 
assessment, management, sustainability and systems. According to Hazarika and Zhang (2019b), Eco-
innovations are likely to create a competitive advantage through market share image building. New 
methodologies must be established and adapted to incorporate the restrictions of eco-innovation in the early 
design to accelerate and improve the design of eco-innovation solutions (Negny et al., 2012). Innovation is seen 
as critical in the built environment for creating profits, lowering manufacturing costs, and enhancing the quality 
and performance of products and services. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an important technique for 
ensuring environmental sustainability. It aims to revise the complicated relationship between environmental 
factors and the product life cycle, taking the complete product supply chain (Motta et al., 2018). Environmental 
considerations can be facilitated by applying management approaches such as eco-management and audit 
systems cost-benefit analysis in the built environment. This comprises the best accessible procedures that are not 
prohibitively expensive, environmental impact assessments, and the most environmentally feasible alternative 
(Hazarika and Zhang, 2019a). New or updated methods, practices, systems, and products that enhance the 
environment and contribute to environmental sustainability are considered innovations (Motta et al., 2018). 
 
4.4 Cluster 4 
The main keywords found in this cluster are CO2 emissions, Empirical-evidence, Financial development, G7, 
Renewable energy consumption and Research-and-Development. As it stands, the environment is at a higher 
risk of deterioration due to CO2 emissions arising from the excessive use of fossil fuels (Ding et al., 2021). 
Thus, renewable energy consumption is predicted to reduce CCO2 emissions, given that it emits no or low 
greenhouse gases. Moreover, financial development, economic growth, and energy use significantly affect CO2 
emissions. Firms recognise the importance of product and market demand competitiveness and seek empirical 
evidence on managing effective product competitiveness (Fernando et al., 2021). Global commerce, 
technological innovation, and per capita income have all improved significantly in the G7 (most industrialised) 
countries. If developing countries' built environments are disadvantaged in terms of environmental innovation 
realities, it is primarily because they cannot afford to invest in and thus benefit from a Research and 
Development unit; additionally, no permanent educational tool has yet been provided to support both the 
managerial level and the innovators involved in the enterprises (Khattak et al., 2022). 
 
4.5 Cluster 5 
The two main keywords found in this cluster are Eco-innovation and Triz. Eco-innovation can be identified in a 
product or a process and can be incremental when a component occurs within a large system. At the same time, 
the system itself stays intact, or radical, when the overall system design changes and hence the way that the parts 
interact with each other. Theory of Inventive Problem  Solving (TRIZ) incorporates the eco-innovative design 
approach. The TRIZ  method without requiring contradiction analysis have  been identified in order to solve 
eco-innovative design  tasks (Negny et al., 2012; Chakroun et al., 2014) 
 
5. Conclusion 
Eco-innovation is a process to address sustainability in the built environment. This article presents the outcomes 
based on the Web of Science core collection database from 2012 to 2022. This paper uses VOSviewer and 
Atlas.ti to analyse the development situation and research hotspots of 26 publications. Clear evidence was found 
that demonstrates that the Eco-innovation literature in the built environment is highly fragmented. The years 
2013 and 2017, no publication was released. While 2018 saw the highest number of publications (8). Thus, this 
paper contributes to extending the current dominant theoretical perspectives. In total, 12 countries/territories 
were recorded as publication geographic distributions, and the most productive ones were the Peoples Republic 
of  China, Italy and France. European countries make up 53% of the publications, while Asia makes up 38%, 
South America makes up 6%, and North America makes up 3%. Africa and Oceania have no representation. 
Future studies should look at eco-innovation in African and Oceania countries.  The study also found sustainable 
production and consumption and journal of cleaner production to the leading journals in terms of impact and 
publications. Our network analysis conclusion shows that eco-innovation in the built environment can be 
divided into five clusters, with the popular cluster being cluster 1.  
 
The main limitation comes from our initial search. We focused only on articles and reviews covered by the Web 
of Science Core Collection, but that database does not cover all journals from their foundation as the search was

Abstract 
 
This study sought to grasp how sawmill wastes are managed and disposed-off in the study area. The research was 
carried out at the Enugu Timber Market in Kenyatta, in Nigeria's eastern region. The study used a descriptive, 
qualitative, and quantitative ex-post facto survey design to create an accurate profile of people, events, and 
situations. To obtain the required data, a triangulation method comprised of questionnaire, interview, and 
observation/photography methods was used.  For primary data collection, stratified random sampling method was 
used to select a realised sample of 250 respondents from a finite population (of 1970 timber market workers) 
comprising of wood processors, carpenters, timber sellers, dealers on wood accessories, food sellers and fabricated 
cart haulers from the areas under survey. The survey results show that sawdust is the most common type of wood 
waste generated, accounting for 28.4 percent of total wood waste generated, and is closely followed by offcuts. The 
study also reveals that open dumping and burning are perhaps the most prevalence method of disposing of wood 
wastes in the study area, with only a small quantity recycled or reused. Improper disposal of wood waste has 
negative effects on the environment because it affects both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Burning waste wood 
also emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing a range of health problems. These wood wastes can be 
best utilised recycling and reusing them to help lessen the impact on and the environment caused by improper 
disposal.

1. Introduction 
One of the most pressing urban challenges is the disposal of municipal solid waste. The development of integrated 
solid waste management facilities is required in order to avoid, recycle, and manage solid waste in ways that 
safeguard human health and the environment most efficiently (Duran et al., 2017). Nigeria is a country with a warm 
equatorial climate that is blessed with huge natural resources of all types to support its citizens' social and economic 
goals (Momodu, 2013; Akpan and Chuku, 2014). After being processed into a finished product, these resources 
generate a large volume of waste. Empirical statistics ranks Nigeria as one of the countries in the world that 
produces high quantities of solid wastes (Nnaji, 2015; Nwachukwu, 2010; Babayemi and Dauda, 2009). This trend 
is projected based on her ever-increasing population, as well as her urban population's refinement in taste and need 
for domestic and industrial commodities, including energy. The unregulated generation and disposal of these wastes 
has deteriorated our otherwise desirable urban environment, and as a result, almost all Nigerian towns are 
characterised by piles or mountains of solid waste (Orhorhoro and Oghoghorie, 2019). In this context, the notion of 
waste creation and its potential consequences on health, environmental quality, and the urban landscape has become 
a contentious issue in Nigeria today (Ike et al., 2018).

490","505,804 tonnes of sawdust are burnt in southwest Nigeria on an annual basis without regard for the environmental 
and air quality concerns that may arise. In Cameroon, 51% of total wood waste produced is gathered for cooking 
(used as refuse derived fuel), 34% for poultry farming, 8% for gardening, and 7% for other purposes such as 
cleaning ceramic tiles after placement (Nyemba et al., 2018).

5.4 Challenges Associated with Improper Management of Sawdust Waste  
The most common management practice in Nigerian wood industries is the burning of waste wood. The burning is 
done in the open, releasing harmful (polluting) substances into the air such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Burning waste wood indiscriminately pollutes the air, and the smoke 
contains fine particulate matter that can scar the lungs. Some wood smoke chemicals, such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxin, are suspected carcinogens. Wood smoke raises the risk of acute respiratory 
infections and interferes with children's normal lung development. It can also weaken the immune system and make 
breathing difficult. 
 
Another common practice of the Enugu wood timber market dealer is the disposal of wood waste in nearby open 
areas. When wood waste is left unchecked for an extended period of time, it begins to decompose and emits methane 
gas, a harmful greenhouse gas. Living things must generate waste; it is inextricably linked to life; it cannot be 
avoided, but it must be managed (Odebunmi, 2001). Waste causes numerous problems, including environmental 
degradation, loss of aesthetic value, the production of unpleasant odors, and smoke pollution of the air during 
improper waste incineration. If not properly disposed of, these can be hazardous to one's health; improperly disposed 
of wastes serve as breeding grounds for pests and disease vectors. However, dumping of sawdust into bodies of 
water can jam up drainage and cause flooding during the rainy season, resulting in the loss of lives and property 
(Elijah and Elegbede, 2015). A water body contaminated by organic pollutant (sawdust waste) has a low diversity 
and number of aquatic organisms (e.g., fish) in the water body. Wood waste dumped in rivers and lakes is toxic and 
clogs fish gills; additionally, light penetration is reduced, limiting aquatic plant productivity. Aquatic organisms are 
vulnerable due to pollution of their environment caused by sawdust waste discharged into water bodies by wood and 
other industries. Sawdust waste management practices in developed countries are more sophisticated than in 
developing countries such as Nigeria. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
Wood waste is generated on a daily basis in Nigeria, as in most developing countries, due to a high demand for 
wood products for a variety of uses. These wood residues have a variety of environmental and health effects. Based 
on the study conducted, it is glaring that the amounts of wood waste generated by this sawmill (Enugu timber 
market) can always be managed without burning it and as such reducing the degree of carbon emission into the 
atmosphere. The treatment of wood waste in the study area and most sawmills is done by open burning. The burning 
of the wastes cannot be totally ruled out, because burning is often the easiest and cheapest means of disposal, 
therefore, it is necessary to recommend that: 
 Only dried wastes should be subjected to burning because of their low moisture contents. Burning should be 
done in batches so that wastes do not smoulder and as such reducing the smoking effects. Also, it should not be 
done in the late afternoon or evening, as the air will be stable.  
 More so, Government and relevant law making agencies should enforce the payment of carbon tax. This would 
go a long way in deterring the use of products with low carbon emission properties.

refinery. This will empower the people economically and create jobs as well. 
 In addition to the aforementioned, the government and NGO’s should synergise their efforts with that of the 
research institutes so as to effectively combat their present day challenges. This would go a long way in 
ensuring that almost all research solves a given problem.

Abstract 
 
Several months since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, the Philippines still has a low immunization coverage. It 
is of high importance that the Cold Chain Systems (CCSs) where these vaccines are stored meet the required 
conditions to ensure the efficacy of each dose of vaccines. This study aims to evaluate and assess the knowledge 
level of Vaccine Cold Chain Handlers (VCCHs), implemented guidelines on COVID-19 vaccine handling, and the 
COVID-19 vaccine management in the National Capital Region (NCR). Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate 
and establish the relationship between the years in service and the educational attainment of VCCHs of the cities. 
The data were collected using a structured questionnaire based on the World Health Organization-Effective 
Vaccine Management (WHO-EVM) tool and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The 
respondents were the VCCHs, responsible for storing and maintaining the vaccine at the lowest distribution points 
in the subject Local Government Units (LGUs). The data collected were analyzed and interpreted using 
Spearman’s Rank Correlation and Fisher’s Exact Test. The results showed that the independent variables, such as 
years in service, educational attainment, knowledge level of VCCHs, and implemented guidelines in COVID-19 
vaccine handling have no significant relationship with the COVID-19 vaccine management and cold chain 
maintenance practice. However, the results could be influenced by the fact the study has a small sample size.

 1. Introduction 
Vaccines have been one of the most efficient inventions and cost-effective public-health tools for saving lives and 
preventing diseases worldwide. Vaccination campaigns have saved billions of dollars in public healthcare costs and 
minimized hundreds of millions of people's deaths. These campaigns also made it possible to eradicate and near 
eliminate diseases such as smallpox and poliomyelitis that victimized hundreds to millions of people (DOH 2021).  
 
In December 2019, a disease called COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus outbreak was first reported in 
Wuhan City, China. After thorough investigations, the WHO stated that the source of the virus, SARS-CoV-2 
(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), came from a zoonotic source (WHO 2020). On March 11, 
2020, WHO declared that the world is in a pandemic. Weeks after recording the Philippines’ first-ever local case of 
the novel coronavirus 2019, President Duterte officially signed Proclamation no. 922 on March 08, 2020, to declare 
a public health emergency with the country's continuous and rapid growth of COVID-19 cases. The NCR was then 
placed under a community quarantine to contain the virus's spread (Baclig 2021). According to WHO (2020), NCR 
became the epicenter of the COVID-19 virus in the country.

501",,"management and cold chain maintenance practice, it is recommended to store their COVID-19 vaccines in large 
refrigerators and freezers with enough room to maintain and store the largest stock of vaccines. It is also 
recommended for the city to invest in calibrated temperature monitoring devices with other features such as an 
alarm system for out-of-range temperatures, low-battery indicator, digital data logger that indicates current, 
minimum, and maximum temperatures.  
 
Likewise, it is recommended for Malabon City to invest in dormitory-style refrigeration units and calibrated 
temperature monitoring devices that include measuring temperatures within +/- 0.5ºC. This will help the VCCHs in 
monitoring the temperature and any alarming irregularities that may occur. For all five cities, it is recommended to 
keep extra water containers in the refrigerator to help maintain cool temperatures, especially during emergencies 
such as power outages. It is recommended that each facility in the lowest distribution points carefully consider 
storage and handling information for vaccines and comply with vaccine handlers' required training policies and 
procedures. It is suggested that all staff who handle or administer vaccines should be familiar with the facility's 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) for vaccines and their related practices. Following the CDC guidelines, the 
training should be completed as a part of onboarding for employees and an annual refresher for handlers involved 
in vaccine storage and handling activities.  
 
A final recommendation is to develop a continuous improvement plan (CIP). The CIP will consist of two main 
parts: the strategic and operational plans. The strategic plan outlines the supply chain's vision, goals, and major 
strategies for the next five years. The operational plan outlines the activities, timelines, responsibilities, costs, and 
indicators for the coming year. There are four steps to the continuous improvement plan: assess, plan, implement, 
and monitor, which repeats in a cycle of continuous learning and innovation. 1) The assessment includes collecting 
and reviewing evidence to identify immunization supply chain (iSC) strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and 
bottlenecks. 2) Planning includes creating a vision, strategy, and operational plan for iSC improvement. 3) 
Implementing includes disseminating the plan and ensuring the fund to put the plan in operation. 4) Monitoring the 
implementation progress toward outcomes. This plan could be consulted to the national Expanded Program on 
Immunization (EPI) team to improve further vaccine management that can help reveal the root causes of supply 
chain problems. 
 
 2.3 Areas for Further Study 
Due to community restrictions in the NCR during the conduct of the study, the researchers were unable to conduct 
face-to-face interviews and physical observations in the lowest distribution point. Future researchers could target 
service points such as vaccination sites, private hospitals, and public health centers of a particular city or rural area 
if time permits. This would allow them to obtain a larger sample size by collecting the lists of health centers and 
targeting nurse vaccinators and anyone with experience in vaccine handling. By having a large sample size, 
parametric tests can be used as it assumes a normal distribution. With this, different statistical tools such as 
Multiple Regression, Pearson’s Correlation, and One-way ANOVA could be used to generalize the results of the 
population. Using these statistical tools is more powerful than nonparametric tests when assumptions are met. In 
addition, further improvements can be made in the survey questionnaire itself by checking the validity and 
reliability of each criterion. Possible additional questions per criterion may be added to measure what they are 
intended to measure fully. Furthermore, additional study variables on vaccine management are proposed to 
evaluate cold chain systems for future research. Some variables to be considered include, but are not limited to, 
availability of funds for cold chain maintenance, types of training on vaccine cold chain management, and cold 
chain EPI guidelines utilization.

Abstract 
 
This study investigated the level of computer numerical control automation in some selected manufacturing 
industries in Kano Nigeria. It details the extent of automation, type of operations automated, obstacles and 
motivators to automate. Earlier research works in the area shows that automation is very  low and there was 
little or no data to indicate the extent and obstacles to automation, a gap that this work fills. To stay competitive, 
manufacturing industries need to be flexible and adaptive to new tools that enhance efficiency and effectiveness 
of operations. Tools such as Lean and Six-Sigma principles that were found to reduce waste in terms of cost, 
time, and improved quality operates better in well automated industries. A field survey was conducted where 20 
industries were mapped out and served with questionnaires. Follow ups were made for clarifications, and data 
was collected and analyzed. The results from the study revealed low level of automation in the industries, but 
the motivation to automate is very high with cost of replacing manufacturing systems with automated ones 
being the major obstacle.

1. Introduction 
Located in the Northern part of Nigeria, Kano is the industrial hub of the North and second only to Lagos in the 
country by the number of manufacturing industries and industrial activities. Industries in the area include 
textiles and garments, food and beverages, plastic material processing, leather, auto assembly plants among 
others. Earlier research on automation in some of the industries revealed low level of automation (Umar and 
Nwachukwu, 2007). As new and competitive operation technologies and management tools evolve, the 
manufacturers in Kano and Nigeria in general face stiffer competition due to influx of cheap foreign goods and 
services promoted by the open market policy of the government and globalization.  
 
The industries can reduce the impacts of globalization by adapting tools such as Lean and Six-Sigma. These are 
some of the tools that have led to tremendous improvement in the reduction of waste in both material and time 
in the manufacturing area and industries that adapted them are currently adjudged as globally competitive.  
For the tools to be operated successfully however, factors such as Just-in-Time (JIT) manufacturing; Total 
Quality Management (TQM); Total Productive Maintenance (TPM); and Human Resource Management (HRM) 
must be implemented ( (Alkhoraifa, et al., 2018). For these factors to be achieved, automation becomes very 
vital. Quality cost which is an element of TQM for example was found to be high at low level of automation of 
manufacturing systems and low at high automation. Manufacturing systems in industries comprise all machines 
and equipment that may be manual or powered. Industries are rated in terms of their output, and this depends to 
a large extent on the combination of their manufacturing systems. ( (Amber & Amber, 1962)  
The main reason of automating is to achieve higher productivity stay competitive in business. Previous research 
(Umar & Nwachukwu, 2007) show that automation in Nigeria is at its early stage and there is little or no data on 
automation in most manufacturing industries in Nigeria. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
This study determined the current level of automation, examine the motivating and inhibiting factors and 
feasibility of adapting it with the aim of improving productivity, quality, and competitiveness of manufacturing 
industries around Kano and Nigeria in general. The outcome can be accessed and utilized by the industries to 
adapt and improve automation and move toward the implementation of competitive tools such as JIT, TQM, 
TPM, Lean, Six Sigma, among others, in the industries.

The Motivators to Implementing Computer-Based Automation  
The results for motivators to implementing computer-based automation are as follows: 
• 
Reduction of cycle time 
The analysis indicates that 25% companies surveyed don’t consider reduction of cycle time as a 
motivational factor, while 75% considers it as a motivational factor. 
• 
Lower production cost 
The result of the survey indicates 80% of companies surveyed are consider lower production cost as 
motivational factor, whereas 20% don’t consider it a motivational factor. This result was also reported 
by (Raja, et al., 2020) that ‘lack of a digital strategy alongside resource scarcity’ emerges as the most 
prominent barrier in both developed and developing economies. The influencing barriers identified 
suggest that improvements in standards and government regulation could facilitate the adoption of 
Industry 4.0 technologies in developing countries. 
• 
Improving personnel safety 
The results indicates that 40% of companies consider improving personnel safety as a motivational 
factor, while 60% don’t consider it a motivational factor 
• 
Improving product safety 
The result for improving product safety is that 60% of the companies indicated that it is motivating 
factor whereas 40% do not consider it a motivational factor 
• 
Improved Product Quality 
The analysis indicates that 20% of companies surveyed do not consider improvement in quality as 
motivational factor while 80% consider it a motivational factor. 
 
6. Conclusions 
About 35%  are food, and 35% are plastic processing industries. 50% produce between 1000 and 100,000unit. 
Only 20% of the companies have been for less than 10years while 5% are between 31-50years by age. 40% have 
51 to 100 employees and only 15%  have more than 200 employees. None of the industries is fully automated 
and 40% have no automation at all. Only about 10%  will be fully automated and  10% will  have  no 
automation in the projected next five years. Operations are fully automated using computer-based automation in 
none of the industries, while 10% indicated that most operations are automated. This indicates that computer-
based automation in the industries is very low.  
 
Some of the operations are: Receiving and inspecting raw materials: None of the industries has automation. Raw 
material preprocessing, 80% have automation. Processing/Filling/Wrapping, 30% have automation. Post process 
handling and inspection, none of the industries have automation. Packaging, only  30 % of companies surveyed 
have automation. Warehousing and Storage, only 5% have automated warehousing and storage. There this 
indicated that even simple operations are not well automated in the industries. 
 
None of companies indicated that the time is a major obstacle in automation. 30 % indicated that technical skills 
are a  major obstacle. 30% indicated that management commitment major obstacle. 10% of companies surveyed 
indicated that nature of business is a major obstacle, while 70% reported cost of automation as the major 
obstacle. 
The Motivators to Implementing Computer-Based Automation in the industries include Reduction of cycle time 
with 75% indicating that it is a motivational factor. Lower production cost, with 80% of companies reporting it 
as a motivational factor. Improving personnel safety with only 40% of companies reporting it as motivational 
factor. Improving product safety, where 60% of the companies indicated that it is a motivating factor and about 
80% of the industries reported improvement in quality as motivational.  
 
Conclusively, it can be inferred that manufacturing industries in the study are no candidates for the introduction 
of competitive tools such as Lean, Six-Sigma Just-In-Time, Total Quality Management, Total Productive 
Maintenance, Cloud Manufacturing. To improve automation, the managements of the various industries must 
show commitment for change, the culture of competitiveness must be imbibed in the industries and the 
responsible agencies must ensure the availability of cheap capital to the industries and promote competitiveness 
in the Nigerian manufacturing sector.

Abstract  
 
Indonesia is one of the countries that implement e-government to overcome the problem of decentralization so that it 
can improve and expand the relationship between the government and other parties by utilizing information 
technology. Based on Presidential Regulation Number 95 of 2018 regarding the Electronic-Based Government 
System, the government has begun to implement an electronic-based government system through e-government to 
encourage the improvement of public services. Environmental Management Efforts and Environmental Monitoring 
Efforts (UKL-UPL) is one of the environmental permits that has to be made for decision making and the basis for 
issuing permits to conduct businesses and or activities. UKL-UPL is made for projects whose environmental impacts 
can be overcome and the scale of control is small and complex. This study aims to build a service quality model on a 
government website that combines eGovQual and TAM so that it can improve service quality which can lead to an 
increase in the reputation of the service quality. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was 
used to create a service quality model. This research produces priority service quality improvements in efficiency 
and suggests several improvements that the government of Jakarta can implement.

1. Introduction  
Governments worldwide are actively promoting e-government to build online connections with citizens and other 
stakeholders (Wang and Teo 2020). E-government can be defined as the government's use of web-based 
technologies and applications, or electronic services, that improve accessibility and provide services to citizens, 
residents, businesses, and other entities (Layne and Lee 2001). Indonesia is one of the countries that implement e-
government to overcome the problem of decentralization to improve and expand the relationship between the 
government and other parties by utilizing information technology (Susanto and Bahaweres 2013). Based on 
Presidential Regulation Number 95 of 2018 regarding the Electronic-Based Government System, the government 
has begun to implement an electronic-based government system through the government to encourage the 
improvement of public services. This regulation requires all public institutions to digitize public services to reduce 
budget and resources (Sulistya et al. 2019). 
 
According to the Regulation of the Minister of Environment of the Republic of Indonesia Number 16 of 2012 
concerning Guidelines for Preparation of Environmental Documents, Environmental Management Efforts and 
Environmental Monitoring Efforts (UKL-UPL) is an environmental permit to manage and monitor the businesses or 
activities that do not have a significant impact on the environment. UKL-UPL is made for decision making and the 
basis for issuing permits to conduct business and or activities. UKL-UPL with business locations or activities in 
Jakarta can be managed through Jakarta's government website, called jakevo.jakarta.go.id. The UKL-UPL permit 
process has a standard completion time of 14 working days. Based on data from the Investment and One-Stop 
Integrated Service Agency of Jakarta Provincial Government (DPMPTSP DKI Jakarta), the percentage of late 
issuance tends to increase from early February to October 2021, with the highest in October. The percentage of 
delays from February to October 2021 respectively are 0%; 27.3%; 19.1%, 39.2%; 43.7%; 42.6%; 41.3%; 43%; 
48.1%.

Based on the structural model results, the variables that affect citizen satisfaction are perceived usefulness, 
efficiency, and citizen support. To find out the variables that are prioritized in improving service quality in making 
UKL-UPL environmental permits on the Jakevo website is to look at the path coefficient values. Perceived 
usefulness has a value of 0.364; efficiency has a value of 0.368; citizen support has a value of 0.278. Based on these 
results, efficiency has the most significant path coefficient value and is the first priority in improving the service 
quality. 
 
Efficiency is related to the time it takes to find information and the quality of the information provided by the 
website. Efficiency considers a website structure that is clear and easy to follow, how well the website layout is, 
how well the website can be customized according to the user's wishes, whether the information listed is detailed 
and new, and whether there is sufficient information to complete permit processing through the website 
(Papadomichelaki and Mentzas 2012). Therefore, the solution that researchers can suggest is to design a user-
friendly website by implementing the following things, 1) Easy-to-use navigation is applied. Navigation is one of 
the most important aspects of making a user-friendly website. Navigation serves to guide web visitors to find 
information and content, so the navigation provided on the website should be easy to use. 2) Content that is 
comfortable to read. Longer paragraphs can be divided into several shorter paragraphs to make it easier for visitors 
to read the content. In addition, the font size, font type, text colour, and background colour can make visitors 
comfortable when reading it. 3) The information provided is the latest. 4) Have a responsive design. Currently, many 
users on the internet access websites via smartphones or other mobile devices. Responsive design can provide 
convenience for web visitors because the web display will automatically adjust the size used. With this design, the 
appearance and content on the website page can look neat on all the devices used.

531","6. Conclusion  
This study objective is to improve the service quality of Jakarta’s government website by determining service 
quality factors that must be improved to achieve citizen satisfaction and formulating a service quality improvement 
plan based on the factors that became a priority for the improvements. This research integrates TAM and the e-
GovQual model. The result of hypotheses testing shows that among seven hypotheses formulated, four hypotheses 
were not rejected since the hypotheses were statistically significant. Perceived usefulness, efficiency, and citizen 
support proved to affect citizen satisfaction while perceived ease of use shows to affect perceived usefulness. Based 
on the path coefficient result, efficiency has the most significant value. Therefore, the improvement must be focused 
on increasing efficiency. 
 
This research has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this research becomes the first study to 
combine e-GovQual and TAM in the context of e-government service quality. This model could be used in other 
similar research related to the online service quality in the e-government sector, in a different country, or a different 
region. This research finding found the most critical variable that must be improved to achieve citizen satisfaction. 
For that reason, the government of Jakarta can implement the strategy suggested by this research.

Abstract 
 
The deterioration and subsequent maintenance strategies significantly affect equipment reliability and availability. 
Spares replacement and or reuse are critical and complement both preventive and corrective maintenance strategies, 
although sparse work on their influence on maintenance cost and availability has been done. A discrete event 
simulation model incorporating preventive (PM) and corrective (CM) maintenance actions on multiple critical 
equipment components are advanced to investigate the influence of reusing and replacing spares on equipment 
availability and maintenance cost. During PM, spare replacement is modelled using block policy (BRP) or the PM 
kit. The stochastic component deterioration is modelled following the Semi-Markov Decision Process, where the 
impact of the maintenance strategy changes the remaining useful life of the components. The proposed study is 
demonstrated through the use case of a thermal power plant, where components of the turbocharger, one of the 
critical subsystems, are modelled. The study shows that reusing significantly improves availability but does not 
reduce cost due to compromising component reliability. The use of the PM kit improves performance significantly 
compared to using BRP under PM. At the same time, an increase in the PM interval depicts an increase in the 
maintenance cost and availability. These findings have significant implications while understanding the dynamics of 
the various maintenance actions and further offering maintenance decision support to enhance the equipment 
availability and reduce the maintenance cost for critical equipment.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background 
Maintenance optimization seeks to balance the resources available at the disposal of the plant with plant availability 
and cost reduction. Such a balance is not straightforward and often requires in-depth study of the variables that 
affect the objectives of the plant, including their interactions with each other which subsequently affect the 
performance. Several salient factors must be considered to address the challenge of optimizing plant availability and 
maintenance costs to achieve this objective. Equipment usage, degradation, and failure characteristics are essential 
to prescribe maintenance intervention Mburu et al. (2021) accurately. Similarly, significant are the maintenance 
interventions such as corrective, preventive, and condition-based maintenance, which significantly affect the state of 
the equipment/component positively or negatively in case of perfect and imperfect maintenance, respectively 
Wakiru et al. (2021). Different variants of preventive maintenance (PM) can be followed during an optimization 
which includes the use of PM kits that offer lower cost and reduce maintenance time, use of newly manufactured 
spares for PM replacement Chang (2012), and use product-service system (PSS) where the plant purchases, the 
performance and not the equipment Tukker (2015), and the conventional block-based replacement where 
components are replaced with new spares. 
 
While considering the factors aforementioned in maintenance optimization, studies such as Savsar (2015) have 
considered single factor optimization, which follows the main effects of the single maintenance variable. 
Furthermore, such studies ignore the interactive effects, where several optimization objectives often conflict. Hence,

In summary, the enhanced replacement strategy will ensure the components in operation continuously retain high 
reliability; hence, if they are reused, the reliability retained within will ensure longevity and reduced failures. This 
subsequently will offer a reduction of the 𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚 if both reuse and replace strategies can be employed in a hybrid 
approach to complement each other. Another downside of the replace strategy is the possibility of replacing 
components whose whole life is not fully exploited, and hence, the reliance on newly manufactured spares during 
both the PM and CM activities, complemented with the high instantaneous availability of the inventory, 
undoubtedly will increase 𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚. These approaches would indirectly relate to replacing components before fully 
exploiting their residual life, an exercise that may be referred to as ,over maintenance.,  
 
3.4 
Summary  
Some of the issues emerging from these findings relate principally to the importance of accurately establishing the 
accurate time to make a specific maintenance intervention to mitigate what was earlier highlighted as ,over 
maintenance, and unplanned failures. An approach should be derived for such a plant to either consider the severity 
or the mean residual life of the component while deciding when to intervene with a specific maintenance 
strategy/policy. Hence, further work is required to consider these two aspects, i.e., the component severity (hazard 
rate) and remaining useful life (RUL) in maintenance intervention decision-making. This combination of findings 
considering the influences of 𝜂𝜂1, 𝜂𝜂2 and τ on both 𝐴𝐴𝑜𝑜 and 𝐶𝐶𝑚𝑚 provides some support for the conceptual premise that 
reliance on a single decision variable or main effects leads to sub-optimal maintenance optimization. It is then 
prudent for maintenance managers to investigate all possible decision variables that demonstrate the potential to be 
included in the maintenance program. The evaluation should address both effects or impacts on the performance 
measures and their interaction characteristics. This will inform the maintenance team on the essential decision 
variables to consider, hence, deriving a wholesome and accurate optimization outcome. From the sensitivity 
analysis, it has been demonstrated that enhanced utilization of the reuse strategy offers better optimization outcomes 
compared to replace strategy. However, using both strategies under a hybrid approach forms a substantial issue for 
future work.  
 
4. Conclusion 
The present research aimed to examine the effects of reliance on reuse and replace maintenance strategy, the PM 
interval, and the PM kit on both the Turbocharger availability and total maintenance cost. The results clearly show 
that reliance on a single variable for optimization would lead to the sub-optimal outcome. These findings provide 
significant implications for understanding how the investigated decision variables should be incorporated in the 
optimization processes. The insights gained from this study will assist the maintenance managers while prudently 
selecting the maintenance variables that will significantly affect their maintenance programs, especially as concerns 
optimization where various decision variables constitute the maintenance objective function. 
 
To attain near empirical performance measures, subsequent work incorporating the analysis of effect and 
interactions, condition-based maintenance, and utilization of an RUL threshold for maintenance intervention 
decision making is proposed.

Abstract  
 
The role of scientific, technological, and engineering education in nations’ political, economic, social, 
infrastructural, environmental and human developments cannot be over accentuated. They form the drivers that 
propel advancement of any nation. Africa presently ranks high among the continents with a high number of 
sovereign nations operating consumer-based economies. There is no doubt that the quality of its engineering and 
scientific education plays vital roles in its technological breakthroughs or retrograde. It is observed that 
engineering/ scientific education in Africa is theory and examination rather than outcome and solution based due 
to the continual disconnection between the industry and the academia. Bridging the industry-university gap is 
the sure solution to the challenges of advancing the development of the continent. In this paper, ways of 
achieving mutual collaboration, partnership, and industry participation in engineering learning processes are 
discussed to aid the production of quality solution-oriented graduates to drive the wheels of her development.

1. Introduction  
Engineering development is the bedrock of Africa’s socio-techno-economic and environmental development. 
There is no reason why Africa should be listed among the poor of the world, following its natural endowments 
ranging from its landscape, climate, and mineral deposits to human resources. Despite the presence of these 
natural endowments, poverty, underdevelopment, and economic slavery remain endemic in the continent. 
Ironically, the development of the world’s economic giants rests on Africa’s resources (human and materials 
inclusive) ferried across its shores. One major contributor to its economic and industrial decline is the deficiency

544","Course teaching sharing with engineers in the industry is highly encouraged. The university should encourage 
inter-disciplinary studies, multi-disciplinary students’ projects where every engineering profession is valued for 
its professional relevance. The university owes it as a duty to let the students be aware that in the real world, one 
will not find any company that has only one category of engineers working there.  Every company exists 
because it has an underlying need or a problem or set of problems, something of value to offer to the society, 
and earns money selling those products or services to target customers via well designed business models.  It is 
hard to find any product these days that has purely mechanical components. For example, the days are gone 
when vehicle transmission systems (gear and clutch systems) are solely made of mechanical components.  The 
vehicles driven these days have a combination of mechanical, electrical and electronic parts.  In the oil and gas 
industries, it will be realized that engineers not only compete against other engineering disciplines, but are also 
competing against people with science backgrounds like physics, mathematics majors, geologists, etc.  
 
Postgraduate research projects should be targeted towards solving an existing problem facing 
local/African/developing countries or even global industries or helping specific companies solve real problems 
facing them, with the ultimate goal of creating new opportunities. This approach not only makes the university 
and the research engineers and lecturers super wealthy, attracts investment interest from private equity firms and 
think tanks, but also ends up in the birth of real businesses (SMEs and corporations) that will employ thousands 
of new graduates.  The university should actively seek new areas of research by proactively going to companies 
to ask what their immediate pressing problems are and assembling students to focus on the problem as their 
research projects, PhD projects and case studies, to find solutions for the Companies.  
 
 The engineering departments need to include some entrepreneurial, financial analysis and management courses, 
business model analysis, business case presentation modules in their curriculum. Engineers need to be groomed 
to think of running small start-up and early-stage businesses, versus just being employees. This will completely 
change the perspectives of our graduates 
 
3.2.4 Suitable learning environment 
Poor infrastructure in our universities/polytechnics is a setback to quality engineering education which the 
industries can help to solve. Many academics in African institutions who studied outside the continent dream to 
have such facilities like conducive accommodation for staff and students, equipment for teaching and learning, 
social amenities (water, uninterrupted electricity, campus security, transportation, internet services etc), 
laboratory supplies etc in African institutions. The level of infrastructural decay in the institutions requires 
urgent attention of not only the government but the private sector. The private sector should leverage on 
institutional endowment fund programmes to register their contribution towards funding engineering education 
for national development. Multinational companies should take up the building of laboratories, classroom blocks 
with modern facilities, staff offices, and sporting facilities to aid the government. These help to condition the 
minds of students and teachers towards excellence. Scholarship opportunities to indigent students are 
motivations towards excellence. 
 
4. Conclusion  
The overarching importance of university –industry collaboration in the development of Africa cannot be over 
discussed. In this paper, the challenges and overriding effects of government’s sole funding if tertiary education 
are discussed as well as the private sector contribution to ameliorate the problems discussed. If quality 
education, engineering graduates and wealth creation are to be ensured, then industry participation in providing 
quality teaching, infrastructure and curriculum development should be pursued with vigour.

Abstract 
 
This study examined the effect of knowledge sharing strategy and operational performance at the University of 
Uyo Teaching Hospital, Uyo - Nigeria. In the study, we used the proportional sampling technique to determine 
the respondents. The clinical staff of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital was used as respondents. We got 
a sample size of 400 clinical staff from a population size of 798 via the administration of four hundred and fifty 
(450) copies of the questionnaire to selected clinical staff. Thus, we employed frequencies; Linear Regression 
Model, and Morphological Analysis for data analysis. The findings revealed that knowledge sharing has a 
statistically significant effect on the operational performance of a tertiary hospital (p-value < 001). The 
morphological analysis revealed that technology is the key driver of knowledge sharing in the organisation. 
Regrettably, the use of technology in knowledge sharing at the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital is rather 
very low. We conclude that knowledge sharing practices have a significant effect on the operational 
performance of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital. We also conclude the low knowledge sharing 
capabilities of the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital are because of poor technology utilization in knowledge 
management. Thus, we recommend that the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital should increase knowledge 
sharing through the extensive and diverse use of technology as such actions can lead to increased operational 
performance.

1. Introduction 
 The creating, sharing and transferring of knowledge in all organisations, especially the health sector, has 
become a critical factor in their operational success. It becomes highly demanding that managers and 
administrators of such organisations must possess the requisite ability to control, monitor, and enhance 
knowledge sharing in their organisations. This process is the management of knowledge (Cruz and Farreira, 
2016). Knowledge management is “the creation and development of internal organisational conditions, which 
bring together all processes related to knowledge of reaching the goal of the organisation” (Alan, 2012). We can 
view knowledge management through culture, technology and human resources capabilities. These components 
influence the transfer and sharing of knowledge. They also regulate the sharing and dissemination of knowledge 
enhancing information. These components regulate the transfer and storage of knowledge in any organisation 
(Cruz and Farreira, 2016). Knowledge sharing requires the willingness of an individual, teams or units to work 
with each other and share knowledge with their collective interest. It has a more significant influence on the 
operational performance of an organisation more than financial performance (Son, Phong and Loan, 2020). We 
find knowledge sharing in literature to enhance the operational performance of every organisation (Nguyen et 
al., 2019; Oyemomi et al., 2016). Regrettably, certain individuals consider the sharing of knowledge as a loss to 
them when giving out knowledge and the competitive nature of the work environment makes the sharing of 
knowledge difficult since employees seek to prove individual or group efficiency. An organisation’s recruitment 
process creates a perspective that they employ and kept in employees based on their knowledge prowess in all 
other considerations. This posture makes it difficult to manage the acquisition, sharing and transferring of 
knowledge. Despite being difficult, we could manage knowledge sharing in an organisation through the 
organisations’ culture where individuals and groups either exhibit sharing culture or choose individualism. The

From Table 5, a morphological analysis to show the practice of knowledge sharing in the University of Uyo 
Teaching Hospital. In assessing the knowledge components, we observed that the hospital requires diverse 
knowledge. Although this organisation needs diverse knowledge, the task carried out in the hospital are 
interdependent. This knowledge requirement clearly defines areas of knowledge needed; by this, they showed 
clear territory. The organisation comprises highly intelligent persons who are power ambitious and need 
psychological ownership of the knowledge they offer for sharing. This makes knowledge sharing difficult, even 
though individuals in this organisation seek to expand their knowledge. Regrettably, the interdependence of task 
in the organisation creates a need for knowledge sharing practices. Despite these bottlenecks, the individuals in 
this organisation showed high personal traits from sharing knowledge and the desire for creativity provides a 
leverage for knowledge sharing. The groups or teams in this organisation have poor knowledge communication 
and barely trust the knowledge sharing practice. We found this between individuals in teams that are competing 
among themselves and teams who see themselves as competitors. Negative group dynamics was a common 
feature in their knowledge sharing structure. There was also high time pressure to complete task need for 
smooth operations of the organisation and very little time allocated for sharing knowledge 
 
Management commitment to knowledge sharing is a key component in achieving effective knowledge sharing 
practices. The management of this organisation has no regulation on the sharing of both tacit and explicit 
knowledge in the organisation. This resulted in poor knowledge sharing climate and interpersonal dynamics. 
There was no clear definition of how individuals’ interpersonal skills in an organisation are guided to enhance 
the sharing of tacit knowledge. This showed poor leadership and innovation in terms of knowledge sharing in 
the tertiary hospital where knowledge in the key component of their operations. There was no deliberate action 
to introduce technology in her knowledge management system. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Knowledge sharing practices have a significant effect on the operational performance of tertiary healthcare 
organizations such as the University of Uyo Teaching Hospital (UUTH). UUTH being a tertiary healthcare 
facility is driven by the knowledge of individuals, and groups in the organization. They enhance the growth of 
this organisation through the capabilities of these individuals and their ability to deliver knowledge to others. 
Highly intelligent persons make up the individuals and groups in the organisation, that is the reason knowledge 
sharing is difficult. A good reward system that encourages knowledge sharing will improve the knowledge 
sharing capabilities of such an institution. The result, which shows a positive significant relationship between

Abstract 
 
The study was undertaken to assess the calorific value of briquettes produced from rice husk bonded with cassava 
starch. Rice husk was mixed with the starch binder in a ratio of 100:15. Combustion related properties namely 
percentage volatile matter, percentage ash content, percentage fixed carbon and calorific value of the briquettes 
where determined. Results indicated that the average percentage moisture content, the average percentage volatile 
matter, the average percentage ash content, the average percentage fixed carbon and the average calorific value for 
the rice husk briquette produced were 5.87%, 14.35%, 5.34%, 74.45%, 14304.61KCal/Kg respectively. These 
results indicate that the briquettes made from rice husk have high heating value enough for domestic, small-scale 
industrial cottage applications. This research has established the potential of rice husk briquettes as alternative 
material for firewood, charcoals and fossil fuels.

1. Introduction 
“The primary source of energy for such vital activities as cooking and space heating is burning wood and other 
agricultural products. An increasing population using dwindling resource of combustible biomass materials will 
eventually result in the shortage of those materials unless urgent steps are taken to reverse the trend. One way of 
making efficient use of existing resources is briquetting. Briquetting involves collecting combustible materials that 
are not usable due to lack of density, compressing them into solid fuels of convenient shape that can burn like wood 
or charcoal” (Khadatkar and Gangwani 2016). 
 
Mordi (2007) “defined biomass briquetting as the densification of loose agro residues with or without binding agents 
to produce compact solid composites of different sizes with the application of pressure. A briquette is the product 
formed from the physio-mechanical conversion of dry, loose and tiny particle size material with or without the 
addition of an additive into a solid state characterized by a regular shape. Briquettes are mainly used for heat 
applications (steam generation, melting metals, space heating, brick kilns, tea curing, etc) and power generation 
through gasification of biomass briquettes and for domestic uses”.  
 
Biomass briquettes are a proven way of generating energy from waste. Different types of waste have been utilized in 
order to develop biomass briquettes. Recently, Romallosa and Kraft (2017) revealed that the simulated fabrication of 
biomass briquettes derived from the municipal waste stream could result in feasible on-site fuel production. In 
another report, Garrido et al. (2017) produced briquettes from sawdust, date palm trunk and different plastic wastes, 
lacking an external binding agent. 
 
There is a rapid increase in the volume and types of wastes due to intense activities in the wake of population growth 
and improved living standards, which are now becoming a major problem as rotten waste biomass emits methane 
and leach-ate. Open burning of these wastes usually generates carbon dioxide (CO2) and other local pollutants 
(UNDP, 1982). Most solid wastes are generated by the rearing of animals, and harvesting and processing of crops.

567","Results from Table 2 and Figure 3, showed that the average percentage volatile matter for the rice husk briquette 
produced is 14.35%. High volatile matter of a briquette indicates ease of ignition, rapid burning and proportionate 
increase in flame length but low heating values. The rice husk briquette produced has a percentage volatile matter 
that falls within the range 10 to 25% for good quality briquettes as reported by Akintaro et al. 2017. 
 
Knowledge of the ash content tells the extent of clogging up of the burning medium. Results from Table 3 and 
Figure 4, showed that the average percentage ash content for the rice husk briquette produced is 5.34%. Low ash 
content offers higher heating value for briquettes but high ash content results in dust emissions that lead to air 
pollution. It affects the combustion volume and efficiency (Obi et al. 2013). High ash content results in lower 
calorific value and vice versa, because ash content influences burning rate as a result of minimization of heat 
transfer to fuel’s interior parts and diffusion of oxygen to the briquette surface during char combustion (Chaney 
2010). 
 
Results from Table 4 and Figure 5, showed that the average percentage fixed carbon for the rice husk briquette 
produced is 74.45%. This result agrees with the result of Pallavi et al. (2013) who reported the suitability of 
briquettes with fixed carbon as 80.5% for domestic applications. Moore and Johnson, (1999) reported that, the 
higher the fixed carbon of a fuel, the greater the calorific value, the smaller the volatile matter, the lower the ash and 
moisture content and the better the quality of the fuel. 
 
The calorific value determines the amount of heat energy present in a material. Results from Table 5 Figure 6, 
showed that the average percentage calorific value for the rice husk briquette produced is 14304.61KCal/Kg. “Ogwu 
et al. (2014) in their work obtained calorific values ranging from 4586.72kcal/kg to 4827.20 kcal/kg” and “Emerhi 
(2011) in his work obtained calorific values ranging from 33116kcal/kg to 23991kcal/kg” when compared with 
results obtained from this work showed that the briquette samples produced has good combustion properties good 
enough for domestic use and small-scale industrial cottage applications. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Fossil fuels and wood fuels are the major source for energy in Nigeria today. The excessive use of these fuels will 
lead to serious environmental issues like global warming, air pollution and deforestation. It is high time we convert 
biomass wastes to useful briquettes, which will be the substitute for these fuels. This work focused on estimating the 
heating values of rice husk briquettes to ascertain its suitability for domestic use and small-scale industrial cottage 
application. Results obtained indicate that the briquettes made from rice husk have high heating value enough for 
domestic use and small-scale industrial cottage applications.

Abstract 
 
Internet-related attacks have become prevalent and are expected to increase as the reliance on the internet also 
increases. Consequently, cyber security has become an essential concept in everyday life and cyber security 
awareness is key in the protection of people and systems against cyber threats. The study is sought to establish the 
current levels of cyber security awareness among students and staff in universities and propose a framework for 
conducting cyber security awareness and education programs. Data analysis was carried out using Statistical 
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and represented in descriptive and frequency ways as well as in percentage 
form. Based on research findings in this study it has been established that students and staff at universities do not 
have the requisite knowledge and understanding of the importance of cyber security principles, their practical 
application in their day-to-day activities, and are not aware of how to protect their data. It is therefore recommended 
that universities should implement comprehensive awareness and education programs for the adoption of necessary 
safety measures and a framework for conducting such programs are proposed.

1. Introduction  
The internet has revolutionized everyday communications such that it is now a preferred medium of everyday 
communications in almost all aspects of people’s lives (Zaryn 2013). With the emergence of a global and borderless 
information society, the internet has brought and continues to bring new opportunities to all countries worldwide as 
technologies play an important role in social and economic development (ITU 2017). We are currently living in an 
age where the use of the internet has become second nature to millions of people (Kritzinger and von Solms 2010). 
In this era of the covid19 pandemic, in almost everything we do, we use the internet. Governments, enterprises, and 
individuals are increasingly reliant on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as digitalization 
proliferates fast in both the private and public sectors (Karyda 2017). In businesses, education, and even in the 
health sector most of the activities have transformed from manual to online. Even on the social side, for example, 
ordering a pizza, buying a television, sharing a moment with a friend, sending a picture over instant messaging 
internet is now preferred over the traditional methods. Over and above its communication value, people use the 
internet for financial and entertainment purposes (PEW Internet 2012). As a result, the dependence of people on the 
internet has grown and continues to grow. 
 
Although the internet has numerous advantages, it is constantly threatened by many risks such as hacking, identity 
theft, phreaking, and online cybercrimes that often have serious effects on those who use the Internet (Kortjan 2013; 
Abbas 2019). Since the use of computers became an integral part of people’s lives, the possibility of breach of 
information has also increased.  
 
The purpose of awareness, as defined by NIST Special Publication (SP) 800–16, Information Technology Security 
Training Requirements: A Role and Performance-Based Model, “is simply to focus attention on security.” 
Awareness is “intended to allow individuals to recognize IT security concerns and respond accordingly.” This is 
important because the user is the first line of defense for an organization’s cybersecurity posture. It is known that

576","From the discussion, it is evident that users at the university are not aware of cyber security risks and threats as such 
there is a need for training and awareness. In the next chapter, the researcher gives a recommendation in relation to 
the objectives of this research and a proposed framework is drawn from the findings of this research. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
In conducting this research, data were collected from 5 groups of respondents which comprised students, both 
undergraduate and postgraduate students and staff members. The gist of the research was to determine the level of 
cyber security awareness and education among the universities students and staff and propose a framework for CSA.  
Based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn:  
● 
The university staff and students do not know the basic concepts of cybersecurity or of the best practices of 
protecting themselves from various forms of attack.   
● 
The practice of key principles of online safety is very limited amongst universities. Cautiousness is not 
practiced, many users still use default or weak passwords, do not use 2FA, and do not hesitate to post their personal 
information online.  
● 
The students and staff have a desire to learn cyber security concepts for their safety and that of the 
university.   
 
6.1 Recommendations  
The Researcher is drawing the following recommendations based on the research findings and reviewed literature as 
aligned to the research questions of this study. The first recommendation is that universities need to implement 
comprehensive cybersecurity awareness and training sessions regularly to ensure that all users know how to 
recognize the most common cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. They should promote knowledge on common 
cybersecurity concepts, including vulnerabilities, attacks, and incidents, to their students and staff to strengthen their 
security position. The second recommendation is that universities should incorporate cyber security-related activities 
which address safety practices, vulnerabilities, incidents, and attacks during the induction of employees and 
orientation of students. This ensures that the users that are being introduced to the data network are well equipped 
with the issues of security and this will enable users to play their part by interacting safely online hence contributing 
to the reduction in the cyber security risk of the University. It is also recommended that universities should also 
make it a routine to occasionally hold symposia, seminars, and public lectures on this topical issue of cyber security. 
This enables students and staff to be educated on the issues of cyber security. It also helps in changing the 
perception of users so that they appreciate that cyber security requires collective action rather than just perceiving it 
to be an ICT technical role. This effort will not only see the reduction in the cyber security risk for the universities 
but is also an effort that will help in controlling this scourge in the Zimbabwean context. There is a need to integrate 
more proactive methods, such as training and interviews. A combination of both methods would be more effective 
and highly recommended. The delivery methods for cybersecurity awareness and training programs can be video-
based, text-based, or game-based, as the target here is adult students. Security awareness must be taught at an early 
age to develop sustainable cybersecurity behavior among users. 
 
The research involved conducting a study at one university to ascertain the current level of cyber security knowledge 
of both students and staff and propose an awareness and education framework on cyber security concepts, risk, and 
vulnerabilities. The objectives that were set were met. Answers to the research questions were obtained from the 
data that was gathered. These answers included the current level of knowledge, skills, attitude, and behaviour of 
users online and ways in which cyber security awareness and education can be incorporated in Zimbabwean 
universities. The challenges that were identified assisted the researcher to suggest ways in which available 
knowledge, skills, and behavior of students and staff, about cyber security can be improved. Finally, a framework 
for implementing cyber security awareness in universities was proposed.

ultimately improve the company's reputation, so that by increasing the reputation, the level of sales of the company's 
products will increase and generate large profits. This research is a descriptive quantitative research method that 
suggests the influence of company reputation and financial performance. The research determines that the 
population of this study is all stakeholders of companies that are members of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce 
(KADIN) in West Java Province, with a sample of medium-sized companies. Data analysis used regression analysis 
with the help of SPSS Ver.25 software. The results of this study indicate the influence of the company's reputation 
on its financial performance, which can be seen from the loyal indicators on the company's reputation variable that 
are interconnected and affect each indicator on financial performance.

1. Introduction  
The business world today is a world full of dynamics. Starting from various kinds of events that occur in the world, 
starting with the volatility of exchange rates, extraordinary competition between superpower countries such as the 
United States and China, so it is known as the trade war between the two countries. The trade trade between the two 
countries not only affects the business world between the two countries, but also affects other countries that have 
trade relations with the United States and China. The issue of the trade war has not yet been resolved, suddenly the 
world is shocked by the Covid-19 Pandemic which is still an issue in developing countries, and this pandemic has of 
course greatly affected business activities in a country. Many companies are not able to adapt to the new normal so 
that the company must be declared bankrupt or the owner of the company closes the company. The Covid-19 
pandemic has begun to show better developments and will turn into endemic, not making challenges in the business 
world easier, because suddenly there is a change in world politics where there is a tension in European countries 
marked by chaotic relations between Russia. and the Ukranian State which caused rising inflation that occurred in 
several countries due to the high prices of energy and mining goods as energy sources. 
 
There are so many challenges that exist in the business world, making a company must have very strong 
fundamentals in order to survive and have a stable and always growing sustainability. According to Wirawati (2003) 
states that company fundamentals are related to the survival of a company, while according to Arini (2014) states 
that a high profitability value indicates good management performance because it affects how quickly or slowly

Abstract  
 
The company's stock price growth in the telecommunication sector is fluctuating, it is necessary to calculate the 
intrinsic value of the share price which can provide information to investors. The purpose of this study is to analyze 
the stock price valuation of telecommunication companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange by reducing 
discounted cash flow. From this research, it can be seen whether the stock price of the telecommunication company 
is at a reasonable, cheap, or expensive level. This study uses descriptive quantitative methods with stock price data 
of telecommunication companies that are members of the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The results of this study show 
that the stock prices of telecommunication companies in Indonesia are in a reasonable position. And this is very 
useful information for both investors and issuers in terms of determining the actions to be taken to get good results 
in their business activities.

1. Introduction  
Telecommunications is an important sub-sector that supports economic growth in Indonesia. Economic growth in 
Indonesia provides a great opportunity for telecommunications companies to expand their business. Along with the 
development of technology, various kinds of telecommunication products and services began to emerge and 
compete with each other to improve performance to be more optimal. Companies in Indonesia have developed very 
rapidly along with the development of information technology. By using today's communication tools, it is certainly 
able to save costs. The telecommunications business is a business that continues to grow in Indonesia in the last few 
years. The telecommunications business in Indonesia is growing with very volatile stock prices. 
 
The capital market is a place for investors to make buying and selling transactions of financial instruments. One of 
them is shares which are securities that show part of ownership of a company. According to Fibrianto and 
Hendrawan (2020:106) stocks are financial instruments that are classified as high-risk high-return. The stock price 
fluctuates over time and its movement in the short term is difficult to predict with certainty. This uncertainty causes 
a high risk for investors. So the decision to hold, sell or buy shares in the market is determined based on their fair 
price which is the result of the valuation calculation. 
 
With the fluctuating growth of the company's stock price in the telecommunications sector, it is necessary to 
calculate the intrinsic value of the share price that can provide information to investors. Intrinsic value is the actual 
or supposed value of the stock. To obtain the intrinsic value, a stock valuation analysis must be carried out. In 
conducting stock valuation analysis according to Tandelilin (2010), investors can perform fundamental analysis. 
Fundamental analysis uses the company's fundamental data derived from the company's financial statements. Stock 
valuation recognizes three types of value, namely market value, book value, and stock intrinsic value. Market value 
is the price of shares that occur on the exchange determined by market participants. Meanwhile, book value is the 
value of a business according to its books or financial statements. Stock valuation will result in the intrinsic value of

Viewed from table 1. PER and PBV of telecommunications companies in Indonesia have varying values in 2021. At 
this point, PER and PBV can draw conclusions about the stock price of these companies in three possibilities, 
namely high prices, low prices or low prices. reasonable. These three conclusions become very important 
information for investors in determining their steps towards company shares. From the data above, it can be seen 
that some telecommunication companies have expensive prices and some are also cheap not compared to the 
industry average of PER and PBV. 
 
4.2 Classic Assumption Test 
The normality test is used to measure the data that has been obtained and then tested to see whether the data is 
normally distributed or not so that the statistical selection can be done correctly. 
Decision-making guidelines are: 
1. If the profitability value > 0.05 then the data is normally distributed. 
2. If the profitability value <0.05 then the data is not normally distributed. 
The following is a table of normality test results using the One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov method and 
Shapiro-Wilk with the help of SPSS Software vers.26.00.

Based on the table 2 of normality test results above, it shows that the value of the profitability obtained is 0.00 and 
the PER value is 0.00. Based on the decision-making reference, the value obtained by PBV and PER is below the 
reference level, which is below 0.5 or 5%. From these data PER and PBV are not normally distributed, so the next 
step used to perform the difference test is to use the Mann-Whitney U test method. 
In this study the data used are not normally distributed so that the method used to perform a different test with data 
that is not normally distributed is to use the Mann-Whitney U test. The references used in decision making are: 
1. If profitability > 0.05 then there is no significant difference. 
2. If profitability <0.05 then there is a significant difference. 
From these tests, the results of the Mann-Whitney U test are obtained as follows (table 3):

Based on the statistical test table 3 above, it can be seen that the mean PER ranking value is smaller, namely 39.87 
compared to PBV of 3.02. So based on the test results, it can be said that H1 is accepted which means that the PER 
value is lower than PBV and H2 is accepted which means that the PBV value is higher than the PER value in 
measuring the company's financial performance.

Based on the table 4, it shows that the resulting value of Asymp.Sig.(2-tailed) is 0.00 which means that the different 
test results obtained are below the reference level of 0.05 or 5%. Thus, if the result is < from the reference level, it 
means that there is a significant difference. So H3 is accepted because there is a significant difference between the 
PER and PBV ratios in measuring financial performance. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research and testing that has been carried out to compare PER with PBV at 
telecommunications companies in Indonesia, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
 
1. Measuring financial performance using PER shows a value that fluctuates every year. However, based on the 
different test, the PER value obtained is lower than the PBV 
2. Measuring financial performance using PBV shows an increasing value every year. Based on the different test 
results, the PBV value is higher than PER. 
3. Based on the two measurement methods, namely PER and PBV based on the test results there are significant 
differences. Of the two methods, PBV is said to be better than PER in measuring financial performance because the 
PBV method takes into account the risks and costs of capital used by the company.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents a new inspection method in Heavy Oil Storage Tanks’. Oil leaks may occur due to defects in 
tanks bottom, which pose a significant risk to the company's environmental, financial and reputation aspects. 
Traditional inspection technique is a long process that needs shutting down the plant, emptying the tank, 
cleaning, decontamination, and sandblasting, which is cost-time consuming and interrupts production 
operations. Recently, an advanced inspection technique called Acoustic Emission Testing (AET) has been 
employed by many companies as an alternative to the old traditional technique. AET can apply inspection and 
evaluation of tank internal condition from the external side, without the need of tank emptying and shutting 
down the plant. The theory of AET is based on sonic sensors that can detect sound signals generated by tiny 
leaks or defects in a tank while the tank is filled and in service. The sensors are attached externally to the tank 
external body and data can be acquired, then filtered, analyzed and evaluated to give valuable information about 
the tank’s internal condition. In this case study, AET inspection was applied on a heavy oil storage tank in 
ISSRAN field-Egypt/ Eastern desert. The results yield a significant reduction in cost, time and overall risk.

1.Introduction  
Scimitar Production Egypt Ltd. (SPEL) is an independent and private oil-producing company at the forefront of 
heavy oil production in Egypt. SPEL has the right of exploration and production in ISSRAN field in concession 
located in the Eastern Desert, 290 km southeast of Cairo. The field produces heavy oil (10-14 API) and was the 
first heavy oil development in Northern Africa stimulated with steam injection. Heavy oil production is a very 
challenging process that needs a specialized operation, especially steam injection in wells, making the 
production process more challenging. The heavy crude oil extraction process is based initially on steam 
injection applied to relatively shallow oil reservoirs, and contain crude oils that are very viscous. This method is 
called enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and is considered one of the main types of thermal stimulation of oil 
reservoirs. 
 
Central processing facilities (CPFs) are significant assets in the field and are considered the primary production 
units. A recent oil leak in CPF1(storage tank) raised the red flag to activate the proactive inspection. CPF tanks 
inspection was deferred by three years which mandates immediate inspection to be applied, but the challenge 
here is applying the inspection and avoiding any production interruption at the same time, so the inspection 
should be done without shutting down the unit and the tanks let being operating in service. 
 
 The presented study shows the efficiency of using acoustic emission testing (AET) as an alternative to a tank 
traditional internal inspection. AET is an advanced inspection tool that can be used as a corrosion monitoring 
tool of a tank using well distributed acoustic sensors attached to a tank shell perimeter externally so it can be 
used when the tank is in service and eliminate the need for intrusive internal inspection (C.M. Nickolaus,1988). 
Using AET as an alternative to traditional inspection techniques is permitted by API and regulatory standards 
and can be employed as a risk-based assessment program under API std 653. The objective of this research will 
be reached by conducting an AET inspection on one primary tank in CPF2 (storage tank) as a demo trial to 
assure the effectiveness, quality, and sensitivity of testand data acquired.

yield failure rates as an alternative to corrosion rates and failure time as an alternative to estimated lifetime. 
 
5.4 Validation 
All the data and results acquired from the AET approach applied on ISSARAN field were compared against 
historical data from another AET application on Abu-Rudies Field, South Sinai, Egypt. The results showed 
similar quality and sensitivity relevant to AE signals interpretation. 
 
6.Conclusion  
Storage tanks typically contain large volumes of valuable but potentially hazardous fluids. Inspection is a crucial 
element of the integrity management of storage tanks. The objective of the inspection is to provide information 
on the tank condition. Opening storage tanks for internal inspection is a lengthy and complex process, not only 
will the tank be unavailable during the internal inspection, but it must be drained and cleaned before entry is 
possible. There are also safety hazards associated with personnel entry for inspection. As such Advanced 
Inspection AET method offers an attractive alternative as they can be conducted while the tank is in-service and 
does not require tank entry. AET principle is based on sonic sensors that are attached to the tank external body 
perimeter. Those sensors can receive the sound signals generated from any defect or potential leak areas, then 
the data acquired can be processed, filtered and evaluated to give final inspection results shown as overall 
corrosion grading and potential leakage grading then a risk inspection matrix can be extracted from the two 
grading measures. The results obtained give information about tank internal condition, estimated remaining life, 
corrosion activityand recommendations for repair or replacement, or need for subsequent inspections. 
 
A Case study was applied in ISSRAN field -CPF2 unit -Storage Tank T 130A. The AET inspection procedure 
was applied on this tank as a demo trial to assess the actual benefits from adopting this advanced technique and 
to check the quality of data and sensitivity of the overall procedure. Results were analyzed using advanced 
management tools, including PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle, WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), Gantt 
chart and Bow-Tie model. Results have shown a significant reduction in cost, time and overall risk. 
 
Advanced Acoustic Emission Testing (AET) provides an effective superior alternative to the old traditional 
inspection techniques. The study showed significant benefits from adopting the AET technique as an inspection 
and maintenance planning tool for the above-ground oil storage tanks. These benefits include avoiding 
production interruption and multiple optimizations in time, cost and risk.

Abstract 
 
This research is aimed at finding out challenges of vehicle maintenance system in development nations, and to 
proffer solutions to vehicle maintenance challenge by finding out the synergy between the vehicle owners and 
repairers. The research methodology used in this study was done using structured questionnaires, with one hundred 
and fifty (150) questionnaires sent out across Nigeria, one hundred (100) received and sixty-three (63) being usable. 
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was carried out to analyze the questionnaire to show validity and reliability of 
factors considered using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The result from the 
questionnaire shows that the Maintenance Culture in the Automotive Industry still faces serious challenges ranging 
from extortion from customers, lack of funds to set up standard automobile workshops, low engagement of the 
younger masses in the automotive industry, low use of vehicles due to financial issues, high charges from the 
advanced auto-workshops, circulation of foreign-used vehicles and fairly used parts in the auto-industry. 
Conclusively, solutions such as scheduled maintenance should be carried out frequently on vehicles, the use of try 
by error technique should be reduced because most times it creates more problems to the existing ones, service 
personnel are encouraged to employ the use of diagnosing tool/machines to ease means of identifying problems for 
accuracy and adequate government policy should be ensured.

1. Introduction  
In developing nations, automobiles are at the increase which ranges from various model and type ploughing most 
roads in the country on a daily basis. Most of the users of these cars dedicate little or no attention to constant 
maintenance of their vehicles except there is a huge mechanical fault on the vehicle (Omosule et al. 2017). Some of 
these faults probably might be averted if constant measure of maintenance were put in place. The design of most 
modern vehicles requires scheduled and adequate maintenance as described by the manufacturers of the vehicles, 
unfortunately, the users of these vehicles are less concerned about the proper maintenance culture after purchasing 
such vehicle. Automobiles are consumer goods; the more they are used, the more maintenance is required, and the 
costs of usage continue to increase(Lee and  Chung, 2013). This implies that consumers should take maintenance 
service into consideration when purchasing new vehicles. As important as these vehicles are in the development of 
any nation, they become problematic when not properly maintained. Vehicle maintenance poses a serious challenge 
to the owners, whether individual or corporate organization even government establishment are not left out (Ng et

5.2 Economic Effects on Automotive Industry 
From the results of the EFA, it should be noted that in Maintenance Culture in Automotive Industry in a developing 
nation, the factors ‘SD2’ which denotes the question ‘Will good economy improve vehicle maintenance culture of 
both individual and repairers?’, SD1 which denotes ‘Scheduled maintenance of vehicles is important(i.e scheduled 
car servicing and checking of various mechanical parts)’ and SD3 which denotes ‘Extortions are significant with the 
advanced auto-workshop compared to the road side mechanics?’ are factors that are interrelated, valid and reliable to 
always checkmate while dealing with automobiles because they have been tested using SPSS (Statistical Package for 
Social Sciences). Also, the response rate of those that believed economic factor affects the automotive industry are 
89.7% against 10.3 that disagreed. This must have been a result of the poor economy with a minimum wage of 
30,000, most people can barely afford brand new cars and even foreign used, some can manage locally used cars and 
they do not have the financial capability of maintaining a car frequently. This is a setback in the automobile industry 
and government can encourage locally made assembly and spare parts manufacturing plants to reduce cost of 
vehicles and vehicle parts for an average citizen. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The maintenance culture of the automotive industry in a developing nation in Africa has been studied, the 
challenges, state of readiness and the economic effects have been investigated so as to proffer a possible solution. 
From the research methodology and the Exploratory Factor analysis carried out in this study, it is concluded that 
government should set up a training institution for the automobile sector to train and recruit service personnel’s who 
will head start assembly plants that would be revived in future. Also, the government should reduce the importation 
of foreign vehicles into the country as most of these vehicles do come with faults that can cause damage to the user 
and the vehicle itself. Furthermore, scheduled maintenance should be carried out frequently on a vehicle, while the 
use of try by error technique should be reduced because most times it creates more problems to the existing ones, as 
a result, service personnel’s should encouraged to use diagnosing tool/machines to ease means of fault identification 
for more accuracy. Additionally, the government should revive and encourage assembly plants within the country 
for local car manufacturer and great reduction in the importation of vehicles and its parts. Lastly, Government 
should establish a policy that regulates the price/charges of spare parts, and a policy to regulate the minimum entry 
requirement to this Industry.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to compare (comparatively) the financial performance of property and real estate sector companies 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic for the 2019-2020 period based on liquidity ratios, solvency ratios, 
profitability ratios, and activity ratios. The population taken in this study is the property and real estate sector 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, totaling 62 companies. The sample in this study amounted to 56 
companies which were taken using the Purposive Sampling technique. The data collection technique in this study is 
a documentation technique in the form of secondary data, namely the reports of property and real estate sector 
companies from 2019-2020 that have been audited by an independent auditor published by the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange via the web www.IDX.co.id. The results showed that in terms of the company's liquidity ratio, namely 
sig. The Current Ratio (CR) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic obtained a value of 0.268, which is greater 
than the probability value of 0.05 (0.262 > 0.05). This means that there is no difference in the Current Ratio (CR) 
before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of the company's solvency ratio, namely sig. The Debt to 
Equity Ratio (DER) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic obtained a value of 0.083 which is greater than 0.05 
(0.083 > 0.05). This means that there is no difference in the Debt to Equity Ratio (DER) before and during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of the company's profitability ratios, namely sig. Net Profit Margin (NPM) before 
and during the COVID-19 pandemic obtained a value of 0.000, which is smaller than the probability value of 0.05 
(0.000 < 0.05). This means that there is a difference in Net Profit Margin (NPM) before and during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Meanwhile, in terms of the company's activity ratio, namely sig. Total Assets Turnover (TATO) before 
and during the COVID-19 pandemic obtained a value of 0.015, which is smaller than the probability value of 0.05 
(0.015 < 0.05). This means that there are differences in Total Assets Turnover (TATO) before and during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on table 10, it can be seen that the NPM before and during the Covid-19 pandemic obtained a significance 
value of 0.000 < 0.05, which means H3 is accepted. So it can be concluded that there is a significant difference 
between NPM before and NPM during the Covid-19 pandemic. This result is supported by research (Lument et al, 
2021), which states that there are significant differences in NPM before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in 
transportation companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). And research (Gunawan et al, 2021), states 
that there are significant differences in NPM before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in the hotel, restaurant, and 
tourism sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). 
 
Based on the results of the analysis that companies that had NPM during the pandemic were less than NPM before 
the pandemic were 44 companies. This means that the company had a poor NPM during the Covid-19 pandemic 
because it was unable to maximize its sales contribution in generating net profit, compared to NPM before the 
Covid-19 pandemic. 
 
And the companies that had NPM during the pandemic were more than 11 companies that had NPM before the 
pandemic. This means that the company has a better NPM during the Covid-19 pandemic because it can maximize 
its sales contribution in generating net profit, compared to NPM before the Covid-19 pandemic.

Based on table 11, it can be seen that TATO before and during the Covid-19 pandemic obtained a significance value 
of 0.015 < 0.05, which means H4 is accepted. It can be concluded that there is a significant difference between prior 
tattoos and tattoos during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result is supported by research (Wahyuni, 2021), which 
states that there are significant differences in TATO before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in manufacturing 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). And research (Destiana, 2021), states that there are 
significant differences in TATO before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in Telecommunication Sector companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). 
 
Based on the results of the analysis, 41 companies had fewer tattoos during the pandemic than before the pandemic. 
This means that the company has a TATO that is not good during the Covid-19 pandemic due to the less optimal 
management of company assets, compared to TATO before the Covid-19 pandemic. 
And the companies that had total tattoos during the pandemic were more than 15 companies before the pandemic. 
This means that the company has a better TATO during the Covid-19 pandemic due to the effective management of 
company assets, compared to TATO before the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
Based on the results of research on property and real estate sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
(IDX) for the 2019-2020 period, it can be concluded as follows: 
1. Research results in sig. CR before and during the Covid-19 pandemic obtained a value of 0.268, which is 
greater than the probability value of 0.05 (0.262 > 0.05). This means that there is no difference in CR 
before and during the Covid-19 pandemic in the property and real estate sectors listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange (IDX) for the period 2019-2020. 
2. Research results in sig. DER before and during the Covid-19 pandemic obtained a value of 0.083 which is 
greater than 0.05 (0.083 > 0.05). This means that there is no difference in DER before and during the

To help the company to improve the company's performance and serve as a consideration in the future, the 
researchers hereby provide the following suggestions: 
1. Judging from the liquidity ratio analysis, there are 34 companies whose Current Ratio (CR) must be 
increased after the Covid-19 pandemic has passed. And for companies that have a good Current Ratio 
(CR), it is expected to be maintained. 
2. Judging from the analysis of the solvency ratio, there are 36 companies whose Debt to Equity Ratio (DER) 
must be lowered after the Covid-19 pandemic has passed. And for companies that have good Debt to 
Equity Ratio (DER), it is expected to be maintained. 
3. Judging from the profitability ratio analysis, there are 44 companies whose Net Profit Margin (NPM) must 
be increased after the Covid-19 pandemic has passed. And for companies that have a good Net Profit 
Margin (NPM), it is expected to be maintained. 
4. Judging from the activity ratio analysis, there are 41 companies whose Total Asset Turnover Ratio (TATO) 
must be increased after the Covid-19 pandemic has passed. And for companies that have a good Asset 
Turnover Ratio (TATO), it is expected to be maintained. 
5. For further researchers, it is hoped that they will be able to increase the research comparison period, 
especially the period after the COVID-9 pandemic so that they can find even better test results. And it is 
also recommended to use other financial ratios as well as research variables so that the results of research 
on this topic are broader.

Abstract 
 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution poses significant challenges to manufacturing companies from the technological, 
organizational, and management points of view.  Industry 4.0 has created a new production model where robots are 
effectively used in production, this new production model has begun to change daily life, production, and working 
relations. However, the potential impacts of Industry 4.0 over the labor markets, manufacturing Industries, and energy 
consumption in Africa remain an understudied scholarly area. It is being evaluated that Industry 4.0 will lead to 
technological unemployment via changing the structure of employment and bring new structural problems in terms of 
unemployment and labor relations. This paper aims to explore the impact of Industry 4.0 in Africa and its state of 
readiness. The authors applied a qualitative case study design involving semi-structured interviews with practitioners 
from industry and reviewed existing literature, to analyze the impact of the fourth industrial revolution in 
Africa.  Company websites and annual reports were also examined to increase the reliability and validity of the results.

1. Introduction 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is currently taking place, sets several challenges for manufacturing companies 
from the technological, organizational and management points of view. With the application of new technologies and 
the transformation of processes, significant changes are expected in the field of work, and future production systems 
demand new competencies from employees(“Impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on Supply Chains,” 2017). 
Work organization is expected to become more flexible in time and space, with workflows becoming more transparent, 
decentralized, and less hierarchical(Müller, Buliga, and  Voigt, 2020). The exact risk of digitization is difficult to 
forecast, but nowadays it is becoming clear that workers in some countries are more defenseless than others. For 
example, in some regions, more than 25% of jobs are at high risk of automation(Büchi, Cugno, and  Castagnoli, 2020). 
In the world of future production systems, some processes are expected to be simplified, and others to become much 
more complex and embedded. This is likely to lead to an increase in the number of higher skilled jobs and a reduction 
in jobs requiring lower qualifications(Conference, Woctine, Kurt, and  Kurt, 2019). Industry 4.0 will therefore have a 
significant impact on both the labour market and society. According to Pina et al 2019(Pina, Ferrão, Fournier, 
Lacarrière, and  Corre, 2019), the success of Industry 4.0 will be a function of both technical feasibility and the social 
acceptability of the whole transformation process. Some authors emphasized that if technological changes are not 
accompanied by significant changes in socio-economic systems, social cohesion may weaken(Bal and  Erkan, 2019; 
Lins, Augusto, and  Oliveira, 2020). Industry 4.0 is therefore both a technological and socio-economic phenomenon, 
the likely changes may put pressure on economic policy and regulators, and the new skills and competences required 
by new technologies will require changes to education systems. In the context of Industry 4.0, Alejandro et 
al(2014)(Germán et al., 2019) emphasized that the relocation of production activities to low-wage countries primarily 
affects the production of standardized mass products, but high wage countries need to resolve the contradictions 
between economies of scale and scope. In line with the expected changes, companies are becoming increasingly

631","and  Africa, 2018). The implementation of Industry 4.0 will also allow companies to gain new partners globally, and 
companies should not only regard them in terms of business transactions, but also in terms of the possible knowledge 
acquisition(Africa, 2016). Industry 4.0 brings a whole new perspective to the industry on how manufacturing can be 
collaborated with the latest technologies to get maximum output with minimum resource utilization 
 
6. Conclusion  
 This article presented a literature review, companies’ annual report and interviews from 8 companies implementing 
Industry 4.0 technology in Africa. This was done with the aim to investigate the state of readiness of Africa to fourth 
industrial revolution, by studying the impact of this new technology on labour life and manufacturing industries in 
Africa. Through our examination of 18 cases of Industry 4.0 technology implementation across Africa and from the 
existing literature, several key insights emerge. 
 
 Our findings suggest that Industry 4.0 open a new range of opportunities to explore and develop further monitoring 
and control systems for supporting sustainable decision-making. Our insights also suggest that the perspectives of 
technology providers and users tend to be very different concerning opportunities and risk factors. 
 
   As less labour will be employed, unit costs are getting cheaper in countries that have manufacturing that is 
compatible with industry 4.0. This change gives them a competitive advantage in the exportation of their products, 
leading to an increase in exports and a decrease in imports. Industry 4.0 investments will reduce the employment of 
low-level labour force while increasing the employment of qualified labour force in areas such as design and 
information technology. The increase in personalised product manufacturing will lead to an increase in sales and 
manufacturing. The quality of manufacturing increases with the implementation of Industry 4.0, which will lead to an 
increase in sales and reduction of loss.  These developments in manufacturing will lead to an increase in economic 
growth, which is needed in most African countries. However, data security and organizational resistance has been 
documented as a major challenge of many industrialists. 
 
 Furthermore, the study noticed organizational resistance to Industry 4.0 technologies in Africa, due to high risk of 
losing their jobs. The research suggests that training the young population on these foundations and providing the 
necessary qualified workforce beginning from primary education, vocational high schools and universities, and giving 
education on coding, software, robotic technology will ensure the evolution of the workplace. This approach is not 
implemented in the educational system in Africa which may delay the readiness of Africa to fully implement the fourth 
industrial revolution technologies. 
 
Lastly, Africa needs to urgently upgrade the global competitiveness index. The existing training system implemented 
by most African countries are no longer suitable for this Industrial Revolution and does not serve any functional 
purpose. Consequently, in order to educate the present generation, the National Education System needs a well-
planned educational structure as soon as possible. Most African governments need to promote Industry 4.0 to increase 
exports and decrease imports, and thus make Africa stronger economically.

Abstract  
 
Pandemic covid-19 and the shifting of the digital market and the conventional market in recent years have affected 
FMCG companies to run their business, not only on supply chain and marketing but also on product development. 
To be competitive, FMCG companies must be able to be more agile in developing products. Technology adoption 
has been frequently proven to have a positive impact on agility in the FMCG supply chain. However, limited 
sources evaluate the role of technology adoption on product development agility. By using PLS-SEM (Partial Least 
Square Structural Equation Modelling) which the data were collected through semi-structured interviews and 
questionnaires, this research evaluates the breadth and the depth of implementation of six technology groups (pilot 
plant and prototyping, knowledge management, project management, cloud and information sharing, big data 
analytic, artificial intelligent), and the effect of supporting technology implementation factors to company’s agile 
capability in product development. The results produce a model to understand the correlation between technology 
implementation factors and product development agility.

1. Introduction 
The global business environment which is characterized by highly dynamic and cost-driven global competition 
demands operational excellence and business competitiveness. For a competitive business environment, innovation 
needs to be implanted/driven in all dimensions – product, process, and organization (Udokpro et al. 2020). Providing 
new products that fulfill changes in customer needs is required to get competitive advantages. Although new 
products promise increased profits, the process from start to finish is expensive, time-consuming, and full of 
uncertainty (Ofek 2008). By having more than 270 million people in Indonesia, the FMCG industry in Indonesia has 
many challenges and opportunities. Figure 1 shows the number or new registered consumer goods product in 
Indonesia, indicating business environment keep being more competitive. Thus, the company needs to be able to 
compete in developing more agile products to survive and grow in a changing environment. 
 
Moreover, the challenge does not only triggered by competitor action but also the predictive and unpredictive 
changes in consumer demand like the development of the digital market and pandemic covid-19. The development 
of the digital market and the limited growth of the conventional market in recent years have affected the business 
orientation of FMCG. Mckinsey (2016) reports that digital growth in Indonesia is beginning to reshape the way 
people make decisions, improve customer experience, and create new business models to optimize value chains for 
unprecedented levels of efficiency. In today's dynamic market, companies are under intense pressure to introduce 
new products to compete with their competitors. In addition, new products become obsolete in a very short time. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the world since 2020 has caused disruption in almost all sectors of life. The 
FMCG’s industry is one of the industries that has been affected and has adapted and taken many opportunities amid

Moreover, technology implementation support affects both responding capability and sensing capability by bigger 
path coefficient 0.524 and 0.527 respectively. It means no matter what techniques are used, the good technology 
implementation support enables the technology to give better impact to both responding and sensing capability. To 
achieve the best benefit of technology implementation company should build an organizational culture that is open 
to technology, have a congruent evaluation, and feedback system, congruent needs identification, adequate user 
training, and last communicate the goal of implementation technology clearly. Last, the correlation between agile 
capabilities and product development agility of FMCG company in Indonesia is clearly seen significant. Both 
sensing capability and respond capability affect product development agility equally with similar path coefficient 
0.349 and 0.347 respectively. It means company need to improve both abilities to get company more agile in 
developing new product.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The use of technology is indirectly affected the product development agility of the FMCG industry in Indonesia 
through improving agility capability. It works by catalyzing the product development agility by increasing the 
company's ability to respond to the changes. However, among the six technology groups, only artificial intelligence 
is proven to affect sensing capability significantly by path coefficient 0.201. Moreover, only artificial intelligence 
technology and pilot plant technology affect responding capability significantly by path coefficient 0.177 and 0.181 
respectively. By this, it is highly recommended for FMCG company in Indonesia to invest in pilot plant or artificial 
intelligence technology and to balance both sensing and responding capability. For those who have implemented it, 
they may improve it by increasing the breadth and depth of application of both technologies. Moreover, to achieve 
the best benefit of technology implementation company should build an organizational culture that is open to 
technology, have a congruent evaluation, and feedback system, congruent needs identification, adequate user 
training, and last communicate the goal of implementation technology clearly. There are several gaps in our 
knowledge around technology implementation in research that follow from our findings and would benefit from 
further research, including an in-depth exploration of how combinations of technology support each other’s to 
improve product development agility. It would also be helpful to develop a framework on technology 
implementation support comprehensively which may be used not limited in the FMCG industry.

Abstract 
 
An Ornithopter is a device that mimics the flights of birds by flapping its wings. Aircraft can fly at immense speeds 
and in harsh conditions, but to an extent, they lack the level of maneuverability seen in birds and insects. This work 
delves into the control and automation for stability of flapping wing flight due to its advantages over fixed wing 
fliers like increased maneuverability and its contribution to research and society. To ensure the model stays airborne 
and for the wings to create lift equal to the weight of the Ornithopter, the design and selection of the components 
was carried out to meet the desired performance requirements of an Ornithopter which stems from the features of 
bird flight such as good maneuverability, low speed flight capability, agility, and high propulsive efficiency. The 
Ornithopter was built from materials commonly sourced and modelled by using SolidWorks simulation.

1. Introduction 
A Flapping Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle is also known as an Ornithopter, the name is derived from two Greek 
words, ‘Ornithos’ meaning bird and ‘pteron’ meaning wing. An Ornithopter is a device that flies by flapping its 
wings. It imitates the flight of creatures in nature mainly birds and insects (Rawat et al. 2013). Though these devices 
may differ in form, they are built on the same scale as the creatures they imitate. The wings generate the required lift 
and thrust required for flight via a flapping mechanism which converts the rotary motion of the motors through the 
gears into oscillating motion of the wings. The principle of operation of the Ornithopter is same as the airplane; the 
forward motion through the air allows the wings to deflect air downward, producing lift (Dubey et al. 2017). The 
flapping motion of the wings takes the place of rotating propeller. Engineers and researchers have experimented 
with wings that require carbon fiber, plywood, fabric, ribs, and the trailing edge to be stiff, strong, and for the mass 
to be as low as possible. Unlike airplanes and helicopters, the driving airfoils of the Ornithopter have a flapping or 
oscillating motion, instead of rotary motion (Singhal et al. 2018). As with helicopters, the wings usually have a 
combined function of providing both lift and thrust. Theoretically, the flapping wing can be set to zero angle of 
attack on the upstroke, so it passes easily through the air. Since typically the flapping airfoils produce both lift and 
thrust, drag – inducing structures are minimized. These two advantages potentially allow a high degree of efficiency 
(Bhargava 2014).

The data shows that the Ornithopter will be able to produce an upward force of 2.7 N at 5m/s without assistance 
from flapping. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The study offers an overview of the basic principles of the design of Ornithopters. The first prototype of ornithopter 
was flown for less than 1 min in Dec, 2004. Its wingspan was about 40 cm and weighed around 45 g. This research 
succeeded in increasing its size to 124 cm and its weight to almost 2000 g, which is similar to the average weight of 
a bird, therefore, ensuring that the developed Ornithopter fly in wind velocity of over 5m·s−1. In this paper, the 
aerodynamic behavior of the developed Ornithopter was characterized through experiment and simulation. It was 
evident that the aerodynamic model utilized agrees well with experimental data especially in regions of high angle 
of attack and dynamic-stall effects with no plunging motion. The findings presented in this paper could further 
increase the applicability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Manufacturing Industries.

Abstract 
 
Respiratory-type infections of pandemic scale have shown the critical need for suitable ventilator-type for 
hospitalized patients. While volume and pressure control ventilators are commercial abundance in a clinical setting, 
the choice of which type is considered a determinant factor in recovery during a large-scale medical emergency. A 
novel design of the PID architecture with the capacity to mimic the native human lung under the pathological 
condition of covid-19 type infection is presented. Traction of oxygenation circuit is achieved via electro-pneumatic 
protocol based on coupled solenoid-energized valve over a computer-controlled electro-pneumatic workstation. Our 
observations showed the performance of the Pressure-controlled ventilator (PCV) system in terms of peak time, 
settling time and maximum overshoot yield improved oxygenation throughput. The performance of the lung-
mimicking PID-based control mechanism is attributed to smoothing the control of inspiratory pressure and 
consequently impacting the compliance in the modeled pulmonic vessel.

1. Introduction 
The World Health Organization christened the 2019-nCOV pandemic as the single infection with the all-times 
highest case fatality ratio with mortality of ~4 million and infection cases standing ~ 180 million across all nations 
of the world as of mid-2021. Over the last fifteen months, the epicenters of coronavirus infection are characterized 
by overwhelming hospitalization with attendant respiratory complications necessitating the use of a mechanical 
ventilator as a life-support device.  Near-war zone emergencies and fatal breathing conditions are considered as the 
characteristic feature of nCOV-19 infected patients. With the increasing variants of nCOV-19 in certain parts of the 
US and Europe and the Indian-Sub continent, the need for ventilators as a life-support device is considered critical in 
managing patients with coronavirus infection.  
 
A ventilator is a machine that is mechanically designed to deliver breathable air to and from the lungs to provide a 
breathing mechanism for a patient who is physically unable to breathe enough. A mechanical ventilator is an 
automated device in which energy is transmitted or transformed (by the ventilator drive mechanism) in a 
predetermined manner (using a control circuit) to increase or replace the patient's muscles during breathing 
operation (King 2020). By design, a mechanical ventilator (MV) is an automated machine that is expected to do 
some or all of the work the body needs to get gas in and out of the lungs. As an alternative mode of ventilation,

A simple fast switching valve with PID for Electro-pneumatic position control applications investigated. The result 
of the developed model is shown in Table 3. In addition, electronic circuits for valve control and PID valve control 
designed and built as a complete mechatronic system. The compressor pressure level reached 6 bar, it was observed 
that there was a fluctuation in the pressure movement that dropped below 6 bar, before further increasing to the 6 bar 
mark after approximately 2 s of operation in Electro-pneumatic PCV model. If the tidal volume is less than 600 ml, 
the maximum exhaust airflows from the tube and lungs increase proportionally with increasing tidal volume in 
Electro-pneumatic PCV model. If the tidal volume is greater than 600 ml, the maximum exhaust gas flow of the 
flexible hose increases faster and faster in Electro-pneumatic PCV model.  When the tidal volume is less than 
600ml, the maximum flow rate of air extracted from the lung proportionally increases with increasing tidal volume. 
When the tidal volume is more than 600ml, the maximum the exhaust flow from the lungs increases more and more 
slowly in Electro-pneumatic PCV model.

The simulated analysis also showed the differences in drop and high pressure but no significant difference in the 
result obtained. From the actuator analysis. Single-acting cylinder magnetic cushion helps reduce sudden initial 
system start-up in 1s. This facilitates the slow movement of the actuator to have a good and stable air distribution

5. Conclusion  
The study presented the quantitative evaluation of pneumonic oxygenation in a PID mediated PCV-type life support 
device. The modelled clinical ventilator employs several valves and sensors along with a processing unit to 
implement the required control algorithms. We showed that the performance of PCV system in terms of peak time, 
settling time and maximum overshoot are automatic. The utilization PID control architecture was done to improve 
response time, enabling patients to inhale gas in a timely manner in each positive pressure inhalation phase, and to 
have a better experience, which has less pressure shock during exhalation and inhalation, and has higher safety in 
certain special situations. It was also observed that the maximum pressure of the ventilation device increases slowly 
when the tidal volumes exceed 600 ml. In addition, influence of evacuation time of the ventilator predicted over 
high throughput in time regimes of 1 s; 1.2 s; 1.4 s and 1.6 s. showed that the pressure platform in the pipe might not 
appear if the exhaust time of the ventilator is less than 1.6 s. Meanwhile, decline in pressure fluctuations below 6 bar

Abstract  
 
IS resources are expected to promote competitiveness and profitability, however, employees’ misuse causes 
considerable security threats. To that, global organizations are investing evermore to defend their cyberspaces, but 
they are not able to fully protect them. Cultural factors contributed to influence employees’ behaviours, but studies 
are lacking in Africa. So, developing a conceptual research model that comprising cultural dimensions and 
criminological theories will probably explain the factors that help to design socio-culturally appropriate 
countermeasures in Ethiopia. 
 
Keywords  
IS misuse behaviour, culture, security measure awareness, neutralization techniques, deterrence theory, positivist 
paradigm. 
 
1. Introduction  
Presently, Information Systems (InfoSys) applications and tools in and across organizations create tremendous 
potentials to easily access and practice in a variety of contexts, circumstances and conditions (Li and Siponen, 2011) 
to increase effectiveness and productivity. However, risks associated with InfoSys security problems from the use of 
Infosys resources pose considerable challenges and even result in “corporate liability”, “loss of credibility”, and 
“huge monetary damage” to many organizations (Bulgurcu et al. 2010), and become a worldwide phenomenon. That 
is the reason why organizations are investing a lot to try to deter and protect the problems using technical, 
administrative, procedural, physical controls and enforcing of InfoSys security policies worldwide (D’Arcy and 
Herath, 2011). Whatsoever the investment and effort offered, the problems are ever increasing and becoming more 
sever (Haeussinger and Kranz, 2013) due to the human behavioural factors (Montesdioca and Macada, 2015) that 
take considerable share towards InfoSys security threat incidences (Alnatheer, 2012).  
 
Employee related deviant uses and practices of those resources are increasingly affecting organizations from time to 
time (D’Arcy and Herath, 2011; Barlow et al. 2013). In that regard, strong working procedures, policies and 
deterrence techniques are not guarantee to stop employees misuse intension (Alnatheer, 2012), because the culture 
of practicing InfoSys resources are ever-changing and becoming complex to manage them accordingly 
(Montesdioca and Macada, 2015). Moreover, employees are becoming potentially insiders as they have knowledge 
and privilege to access and practice InfoSys resources and by that means they may pose security risks (Colwill, 
2009), because they are the “weakest link” to organizations (Ifinedo, 2012). That means,  employees  are  both  
security  assets  and vulnerable InfoSys security weak-links, and as a result they can be both part of the problems 
and part of the solutions (Woretaw et al. 2019). InfoSys components including working procedures, workplace 
settings, places that offer InfoSys resources and working situation may also help employees to engage in InfoSys 
misuse behaviour (Maçada and Luciano 2010). So, investigating employees’ psychology, including their beliefs, 
attitudes and perceptions towards creating InfoSys security positive cultures should be well- thought-out (Woretaw 
et al., 2019). InfoSys misuse credited to employees mostly comprise of important organizational InfoSys elements, 
including software, hardware, data, network, computer devices and services (Li and Siponen 2011).

672","A scenario-based approach will be employed for data collection activities, since scenario methods are widely applied 
and highly recommended in studying criminal, unethical and anti- social behaviours (Barlow et al. 2013; Siponen and 
Vance, 2010; D’Arcy et al. 2009), like this current one. The research model, as well as its constructs, will be validated 
and empirically tested using SEM-PLS analysis techniques. Finally, data analysis activities will be performed using 
Smart-PLS as well as SPSS with Amos software tools. 
 
5. Expected Implications of the Study 
5.1. Theoretical contributions 
The study mainly focuses on comparing employees’ use of organizational InfoSys resources and their attitude and 
intention to misuse those resources in the context of Africa (e.g. Ethiopia) and the westerns (e.g. USA). So, the study 
will shed light on how national culture, security awareness, and criminological theories are integrated to understand 
and determine InfoSys misuse intentions using a comparative analysis of data from two culturally different contexts. 
Since an actual behaviour is difficult to measure directly, especially using criminological theories in the case of 
deviant behaviour studies (Siponen and Vance, 2010), this study will try to operationalize intention to explain the 
actual human behaviours aptly. Finally, this study will illustrate how InfoSys misuse behaviours of employees vary 
across cultures. 
 
5.2. Practical Implications 
This study will also help to understand employees’ InfoSys misuse behaviour in order to support the development 
and implementation of culturally as well as contextually appropriate behavioural InfoSys security protection 
measures. The study will also give an implication to managers and policymakers to understand how employees 
rationalize misuse behaviour, thereby, developing appropriate countermeasures to inhibit them from engaging in 
deviant behaviours. It also helps to understand employees’ level of InfoSys security awareness, thereby conducting 
effective awareness campaigns anddeliver appropriate and secure use of InfoSys training.  
 
The findings of this study will be applicable to countries having similar cultures to Ethiopia. Implications for 
employees are also to make them aware of the different InfoSys threat incidences and the impacts associated with 
deterrent countermeasures. It also helps companies of foreign origin while investing in Africa (e.g. Ethiopia) to 
develop and implement appropriate prevention measures to their InfoSys resources, thereby leading safe 
organizations. So, foreign investors can make cognizant decision-making activities when producing InfoSys policies 
in Ethiopia. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Even though this ongoing research includes an important comprehensive conceptual research model that can and 
should be tested to explain how the hypothesized relationships show employee IS misuse behaviour, there are no 
solid results to practically observe how effective the perceived relationships are. In addition, the output of this 
particular study may not be valid and applicable to countries with different socio- cultural settings as the planned 
respondents’ context (i.e. Ethiopian and USA organizational employees). However, it provides an overall insights 
and understandings of the direct effects of cultural values on criminological theories, including neutralization theory 
and rational choice based deterrent constructs along with IS security countermeasure awareness to predict IS misuse 
intentions of employees. In this regard, this proposed study will be the first to examine employees' misuse of IS 
resources in an overlooked and neglected contexts of cultural disparities using a western traditions and the 
developing economy contexts.

Abstract  
 
Cities and urban areas are under constant stress from natural disasters and climate changes to pestilences and 
economic crises, due primarily to anthropological activities and demands. These extraneous circumstances have 
been aptly highlighted by the recent epidemic, which changed the modus-operandi of the world as we know it. 
Nevertheless, the nature of this excessive pressure did not change the burden carried by cities to sustain a people, an 
entire ecosystem, and produce and manage ways that encourage economic successes. Instead, the COVID-19 
pandemic merely revealed the cracks in cities and nations’ already flawed governing systems. Urban resilience is the 
capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow 
no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience. (Urban resilience - Resilient Cities 
Network, no date, para. 5). Therefore, urban resilience can be achieved through effective strategies such as 
regenerative and sustainable Urban Agriculture (UA), which will be the premise of this research. Human behaviour 
relative to the current environment requires understanding so that cohesive coexistence can be bolstered through 
regenerative and restorative practices found in the technology and ecology of the nature of reproduction, that is, 
urban agriculture. City and urban sustainability, specifically for developing countries (the Global South), will shift 
from the conventional concrete jungle’s urban design. Therefore, this urban agricultural perspective is primarily 
explored through the microscope of bee technology and how this simple practice and its principles can be 
incorporated within the urban space to enable resilience, food and nutrition provision and promote economic 
accessibility.

1. Introduction  
The foundation of urban resilience is built on the adopted global policy of the Transforming our World, the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development. These strategies were implemented as a result and by agreement of the 
representative nations at the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Summit. This prestigious event was 
held in September 2015 in New York, USA. The stratagem would comprise of the sustainable goals and targets 
outlined to deal with existing and emerging challenges in the “Global North and Global South”. The objectives are 
to achieve an improved society that is accessible, creates equity and equality, and ensures accountability from the 
various regions. Out of the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identified, SDG 11 – “Make cities 
and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable” (United Nations, 2016), sets the tone for this 
research.

682",,"principles of transferability, transparency and accountability. These would have already been realised in an ideal 
world; however, unmanaged social ills and apathy will mean these ideals will remain vision statements on placards.  
 
The research aims and objectives set out in line with the research questions were crafted to determine the resilience 
of urban agriculture in the City of Tshwane. It is the intention for any government to eventually generate its 
economy while meeting the needs of those in a less fortunate position. By giving all members a fair advantage and 
enabling them to contribute economically, a state can reap far greater rewards, including reducing crime and 
poverty, which are interlinked. Urban agriculture has diverse mannerisms, lending itself to socio-economic and 
environmental needs while challenging the status quo of directives, policies and regulations. Urban agriculture is 
broad and can be managed at micro levels to create a sustainable economy, restore the rural lifestyle, and renovate a 
fragmented city community. Urban agriculture can achieve more resilience in the City of Tshwane, given the right 
platform, environment, and people that can strategise, implement and maintain the more significant objectives of the 
city, the country, and those propelled by international standards.  
 
In their recommendations for proposing a critical intervention site and an area for project development, the South 
African Cities Network’s (2015) analysis of urban agriculture entails three strategic approaches:  
 
(i) There must be better monitoring of urban agriculture in terms of who is benefiting, what is being grown, and 
where the food goes, (ii) There is a need to understand why projects fail to thrive, and (iii) Municipalities should 
partner with NGOs, where possible, to increase the impact of projects.  
 
The above iterates and summarises the study, denoting that urban agriculture is multifaceted, inclusionary, viable 
and subject to failure should the due process be lacking. There is a desperate need to make the data available in a 
quantifiable manner so that there can be simulations that can predict urban agriculture as a resilience strategy. For 
Tshwane, urban resilience is an ongoing opportunity undergirded by urban agriculture and sustainable 
environmental, social, institutional and economic practices.

Abstract 
 
Most peopleassume that investment can provide a profitable output if someone does it right. However, there arestill many 
in dividuals who do not really understand the meaning of their own investment and they fall from adversity. This happens 
due to a lack of insight into investing in the capital marketand the lack of public knowledge aboutgenerating profitable 
profits in thecapital market. This study aims to determine the effect of Financial Literacy and Heuristic Behavior on 
Perception Risk which has an impact on Generation Z's Investment Decisions during the pandemic. The research sample 
was 330 respondents of Generation Z in the JABODETABEKarea and aged 18 - 24 years. This study uses survey 
methods and data collection in the form of a questionnaire by google form. The data was processed using WarpPLS 
version 7.0 software. The result of this study is that there is an influence of Financial Literacy and Heuristic Behavior on 
Perception Risk which has an impacton Generation Z's Investment Decisions during the pandemic.

Abstract 
 
 Every year, cybercriminals become savvier with their phishing attacks and have tried-and-tested methods to 
deceive and steal from innocent victims. With this, this case study aims to remind all Internet users, especially 
people who work from home, about the posing threats when browsing or clicking suspicious links, to give warning 
to those who work in their own homes about the posing threat of keyloggers, and to provide sufficient knowledge 
to those who confidently work in their home about the threats of phishing. The researchers conducted a survey to 
its target users through the zoom meeting application. Purpose of the research were discussed in the zoom meeting 
as well.    Research results show that the work from home employees understands the importance of knowing 
phishing attacks and keyloggers. It is crucial to do a security check-up of personal computers occasionally. 
Initially, in the researcher's pre-test, only 35% of the respondents strongly agreed that understanding phishing is 
necessary. However, after demonstrating how keyloggers work and how it may impact their systems, the initial 
35% rose to 60%. Only 10% of the respondents think knowing phishing and keyloggers will not make their pc 
safer nor impact their work from home jobs.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
     Phishing is one of the ways hackers can collect data from their victims. One of the tools hackers can use to 
collect their victim's data is a keylogger. The potential threat of this application can put someone's privacy in danger, 
such as exposing their password and other security codes. Keylogger is just a simple tool to exploit victims' data, 
and there are still many ways hackers can gather unsuspecting victims' data that can put someone's life in danger. 
 
     The study contributed to the understanding and knowledge of the respondents and there were factors that are 
highly suggested for future awareness and use. The recommendations are as follows: 
• 
To the people who are working from home, it is recommended that they should find ways to look up if the 
link that they are logging in or clicking is legitimate. 
• 
To all computer users, it is recommended to check their personal computer’s security even occasionally 
• 
To all people who have the potential of using any computer, it is recommended to have sufficient 
knowledge about phishing attacks as well as the ways on how to avoid being a victim of any fraudulent 
attacks on the internet.

Abstract 
 
This case study intended to propose an assistive pedestrian system using Arduino UNO as the microcontroller and 
several electronic components for the actuators and sensors of the prototype. For the sensors, ultrasonic sensors will 
be used as a proximity sensor to detect if there are pedestrians that need to cross the road and a passive infrared (PIR) 
is used for motion detection of cards on the road. There are three actuators for this proposed system: speakers, LED, 
and a micro server motor. These actuators produce sound, light, and motor movements respectively, that intended to 
alert pedestrians and drivers for a safer pedestrian crossing. This system suits to assist a wide variety of pedestrians 
including the blind, deaf, and children because of the actuators way of alerting through the sense of hearing, sight, 
and touch. The internet of things technology proposal in this study includes the circuit design, design illustration, 
and costs of materials. The speakers, LEDs, and micro servo motor served as actuators that alert the sense of hearing, 
sight, and touch, respectively, making this proposed project assistive to various pedestrians even to those with 
disabilities.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Study 
According to the National Center for Health Statistics (NHCS), it has been estimated that 7,668 pedestrians have 
been killed due to traffic or non-traffic incidents in 2019 (Injuryfacts 2022). Some of the main causes of these 
incidents are due to pedestrian distractions from texting and calling, poor visibility, darting to the road, and walking 
in the wrong direction (Laborde Earles 2022).   
 
Visually impaired pedestrians rely on the noise of a combustion engine to gain information on their surroundings 
when crossing roads. However, due to the innovation of new technologies such as silent vehicle technology, 
pedestrians with vision impairment/loss may lack awareness of nearby vehicles. Statistics had mentioned that not 
less than 70 visually impaired individuals are involved in pedestrian-related accidents every year (HG.org 2022). 
Pedestrians’ inattentiveness and lack of awareness of the noise and sound of their environment are one of the causes 
of pedestrian-related accidents. Therefore, individuals with hearing disabilities rely on gaining information more on 
visual cues (Arrive 2021. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding Pedestrian Safety, 
20% of all pedestrian deaths and 10% of all pedestrian injuries in 2017 are from individuals that are aged 65 and 
older. Older pedestrians are one of the most at risk due to their speed on crossing roads slower than the average

Internet of Things (IoT) provides the ability to capture and share data through a network of networks. IoT has 
affected many divisions of organizations and one of its priority areas is asset tracking and management. The usage 
of IoT sensors attached to assets had allowed organizations to track information through sensors to track and detect 
the current state of an object such as its position, measure of heat, and motion. This information is tracked and 
obtained without the participation of humans (Nord et al. 2019). With the use of IoT sensors, smart homes (SH)

4. Conclusion 
This project focused on the field of IoT and assistive technology through the use of motion and proximity sensors. 
The restrictions of this setup due to cost and time constraints forced the researchers to substitute expensive and hard-
to-obtain actuators to be substituted by cheaper ones. The speakers, LEDs, and micro servo motor served as 
actuators that alert the sense of hearing, sight, and touch, respectively, making this proposed project assistive to 
various pedestrians even to those with disabilities. For the sensors used, the usage of IR sensors makes the project 
efficient in relation to its effectivity and cost while the ultrasonic sensors are placed for accuracy in proximity 
detection. Thus, this project is a modest attempt for a pedestrian assistance system and improve the safety of 
pedestrians with the prototype model using Arduino UNO and several electronic components. Its implementation 
plan is fairly limited to small pedestrian crossings. However, future researchers in the field of IoT, electronics, IT, 
and engineering could further improve this by enlarging its scope or involving application integrations.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected everyone to an unprecedented shift in the way of their everyday life in 
which fundamental social and work etiquette evolved with taking extra safety measures to contain the virus. A 
new normal has been introduced to prevent the virus's further spread, such as wearing a mask, observing proper 
hand hygiene, and most importantly, physical distancing by staying 6 feet away from others. Public bathrooms 
are inevitable to long lines that would be deemed unsafe in the pandemic since a person’s exposure time is a 
significant factor with the transmission. The system design in this study would help improve user experience in 
public restrooms by eliminating long waiting lines caused by poor communication on a cubicle's vacancy status. 
With utilizing the technology of IoT (Internet of Things), the public would be able to use restrooms with ease 
without worrying about long queues. It would also help reduce interaction with other people, which is functional 
in the ongoing pandemic and could also promote a safe way of using public restrooms by encouraging the 
public to observe social distancing.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Study 
The system “IoT Based Cubicle Occupancy Indicator” will provide an easy way to identify the occupancy of the 
cubicle, so people won’t have to constantly look whether the cubicle is occupied or not. With the use of a 
Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor that will detect if someone is using the cubicle and minimize excessive people in 
restrooms. The Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor responds to changes in the temperature pattern across the sensor's 
field of view. The sensor is passive because it does not emit any energy itself but sends a signal based on the 
pattern of infrared radiation in the environment (Guo and Tiller, 2010). The sensor recognizes infrared light 
emitted from nearby objects wherein the system can detect whether the specific cubicle is currently occupied or 
not. The system will show the information of the occupancy of the cubicle to an IoT Server wherein the people 
can identify the cubicle usage. An IoT server is also known as the Data Integration center which consists of 
highly reliable industrial computer and non-programming data integration software. It equips standard data 
management functions developed especially for data collection, process, saving, notice and publishing. The PIR 
sensor would relay the information of the cubicle occupancy through the LED lights placed in the bathroom 
entrance. This aims to fully combat the existence of the different variant transmission in public restrooms due to 
being a crowded place. With the introduction of these instruments in every cubicle it will further give necessary 
precaution to people who are being stuck in long queues, in that way possible they’ll look for an alternative way 
that they can do to avoid being exposed from other people and preventing in catching the virus, and at the same 
time it will lessen their chances in getting infected. 
 
1.2 Problems or Opportunities 
IoT Based Cubicle Occupancy Indicator will serve as an opportunity for other people to conserve or lessen the 
time to search for an empty toilet. Many of us know that when the call of nature, sometimes there are problems 
or complications like the restroom is closed due to maintenance or the worse is if the restroom has tons of lines 
outside, wherein you must decide whether you will fall in line or search for another restroom. As observed in the 
effect of the COVID-19 restrictions, not all establishment’s restrooms are open.  In effect, it creates long queue 
in those open restrooms. But in this IoT Based Cubicle Occupancy Indicator, the line could be lessened because 
people could know which rest room has no occupants on one of its cubicles.

4. Conclusion 
The system design in this study would help improve user experience in public restrooms by eliminating long 
waiting lines caused by poor communication on a cubicle's vacancy status. With utilizing the technology of IoT 
(Internet of Things), the public would be able to use restrooms with ease without worrying about long queues. It 
would also help reduce interaction with other people, which in times of the ongoing pandemic, is useful and 
could also promote a safe way of using public restrooms by encouraging the public to observe social distancing. 
Proper information relay about a cubicle’s occupancy would also save time as well as increase productivity 
when it comes to office environments.  
 
Some restrictions were made upon the implementation and testing of the system which limited the capacity of 
the system to visualize information. The current system in the study can only accommodate public restrooms 
with no more than five cubicles due to the nature of the lack of a portable way of visualizing the processed data. 
The study made use of LED lights for indicators in each cubicle; if the system were to be implemented in a 
bigger environment, it is highly recommended to use other existing IoT platform that enables the wireless 
display of information. The use of a WIFI module is preferable to provide a seamless wireless display of 
information.

Abstract 
 
 
The aim of the study is to exploit the potential of mud beyond its current applications in construction industries, to 
insulate bio-digesters against temperature fluctuations. To achieve this, six identical fixed dome biogas digesters (32 
Liters) were designed, constructed and used to carryout anaerobic digestion of three feedstocks namely cow 
abdominal waste, poultry droppings and 1:1 mixture of cow abdominal waste and poultry droppings. Three digesters 
were charged and surface covered with mud for insulation while the remaining three were charged and kept on the 
surface uninsulated. The ANOVA result indicates that Mud insulation of digester and feedstock have significant 
effect on the performance of the fixed dome biogas digesters (α =.0.05). The range of pH, Volume of biogas and 
slurry temperature (ST) in all the feedstocks (Cow abdominal waste, poultry droppings and 1:1 mixture of Cow 
abdominal waste and poultry droppings) were 6.948-7.170, 3.643-3.865 liters and 29.917-30.242oC, respectively. 
The highest volume of biogas was produced by mud insulated surface fixed dome biogas digester with cow 
abdominal waste feedstock. The highest temperature evolution was from 1:1 Mixture of Cow Abdominal Waste and 
poultry droppings feedstock.

1.Introduction 
The biogas industry is constantly innovating ways of improving energy recovery from a variety of biomass 
resources. While there are several attempts in this direction, more focus has been placed on bio-digester chemical 
reactions with little attention to system sustainability for long-life performance. The factors affecting uptake of 
biogas systems were investigated by Kahubire et al. (2010), Mittal et al. (2018), Mulinda et al. (2013), Mwirigi et al. 
(2014), Walekhwa et al. (2009) and Roopnarain and Adeleke (2017), who ruled out economic barriers to investment 
as major inhibitor to adoption. Most biogas installations have not sustained gas production (Tumusiime et al. 2019; 
Nabuuma and Okure, 2006; Kariko-Buhwezi et al. 2011), this has partly been due to poor digester operating 
conditions such as low digester temperatures and poor quality of digester feed (Kariko-Buhwezi et al., 2011; 
Mwakaje, 2008). Most biogas digesters operate between 18–25 ◦C (Kariko-Buhwezi et al. 2011), which is far below 
optimum of 30–40 ◦C (Kumar et al. 2013; Al Seadi et al. 2008), with uncontrolled fluctuations which are inhibitory 
to biogas production. According to Al Seadi et al. (2008), methanogenic microorganisms are very sensitive to 
temperature changes, and can only tolerate temperature fluctuations of up to +/−3 ◦C. It should be noted that 
adoption and sustainability are not directly related. For example, studies by Mulinda et al. (2013), Kabir et al. (2013) 
and Mwirigi et al. (2009), indicate that the household’s socioeconomic status influences adoption but it does not 
significantly influence the long term utilization of a biogas system. On the other hand, (Puzzolo et al., 2016) 
revealed that other factors including optimal operation of renewable energy technologies directly influence their 
sustainability.

The results generally indicates that the Cow Dung Abdominal Waste feedstock performed better followed by the 1:1 
mixture of cow abdominal waste and poultry droppings feedstock in the biogas production Process of mud insulated

4. Conclusion 
Digester temperature and feedstock are some of the key influence parameters for optimal biogas recovery, and thus 
its optimization and stability are key requirements for every productive biogas plant. The study aimed to exploit the 
potential of mud beyond its current applications in construction industries, to insulate bio-digesters against 
temperature fluctuations. The results showed that the range of values for pH, volume of biogas and slurry 
temperature were 6.897-7.177, 2.404-5.327 liters and 29. 667-30.467 oC, respectively. Mud insulation of digester 
and feedstock have significant effect on the performance of the fixed dome biogas digesters (α =.0.05).  There are 
significant differences in the mean values of volume of biogas produced  and slurry pH for the six different biogas 
digesters at 5% significant levels.  The mean slurry temperature of the six different digesters were statistically the 
same at 5% significant level. The highest volume of biogas and slurry pH were produced by mud insulated surface 
fixed dome biogas digester with cow abdominal waste feedstock.  The highest pH evolution was from uninsulated 
fixed dome biogas digester with poultry droppings feedstock.  The results generally indicates that the mud insulated 
fixed dome biogas digester with cow abdominal waste performed better than the uninsulated fixed dome  biogas 
digester with respect to the volume of gas produced and pH evolution. The range of pH, Volume of biogas and

abdominal waste and poultry droppings) were 6.948-7.170, 3.643-3.865 liters and 29.917-30.242oC, respectively 
Feedstock has significant effect on pH of the fixed dome biogas digester (α=0.05) but has no effect on both volume 
of  biogas and slurry temperature(ST) at 5% significant levels. The highest volume of biogas and pH were produced 
by Cow Abdominal Waste feedstock. The highest temperature evolution was from 1:1 Mixture of Cow Abdominal 
Waste and poultry droppings feedstock.  The results generally indicates that the Cow Dung Abdominal Waste 
feedstock performed better followed by the 1:1 mixture of cow abdominal waste and poultry droppings feedstock in 
the biogas production Process of mud insulated surface fixed dome biogas digester. We therefore recommend the 
insulation of fixed dome biogas digester and appropriate feedstock for improved biogas production.

Abstract  
 
Ergonomics is concerned with the design of equipment, workstation, facilities and work environment to match the 
human capability and limitations. Most of the Small Scale Industries (SSIs) are characterized by several ergonomic 
deficiencies such as poor work station design, layout problems, awkward postures, excessive noise, heat and poor 
illumination. The present study is focused on the ergonomic deficiencies in a small scale utensils manufacturing 
industry. The typical manufacturing process consists of melting, molding, rolling, plate cutting, circle cutting, press 
work, spinning, polishing & packing. The work in characterized by repetitive activities involving awkward postures, 
frequent twisting, bending, stretching, carrying loads, contact stress and vibrations. 45 workers from different 
sections were selected for study and administered Modified Nordic Questionnaire to know the prevalence of MSDs. 
Ergonomic assessment tools Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) 
were used to determine the postural risks. NIOSH lifting equation determined the lifting index in manual handling 
tasks. Environmental parameters were measured by appropriate instruments. Digital Human Modeling (DHM) 
approach using CATIA software was used to model the human postures and conduct RULA analysis. The working 
postures are again built in CATIA to show improvements. The results indicate prevalence of MSDs among more 
than 50% workers. Postural analysis results in 47% postures in high risk indicating immediate change. Ergonomic 
Interventions in workstation design is shown through DHM, which results in reducing the risk of postures. Some of 
the manual lifting tasks indicated scores between 1 and 3 showing moderate risks due to lifting. Several ergonomic 
interventions were recommended to improve the productivity and safety of employees.

Abstract 
 
The demand for skilled engineers due to dynamics of technology and socio-technological challenges could only be 
met in all countries through sustainable engineering education and practice.  Enhancing sustainable engineering 
education and practice is a global concern especially in developing countries. Over the years, many economies have 
grappled with obsolete, inefficient traditional methods of technology transformation and lack of practical 
implementation of distributed problem-solving techniques, which can be traced to paucity of sustainable engineering 
education. Good efforts had been made in this paper to explore university-industry collaborations as one of the 
robust means to enhancing sustainable engineering education and practice in Nigeria. The identified areas of 
collaboration include establishment of institutional factories and industries, revamping students industrial work 
experience scheme, establishment of engineering schools for further quality practical training after graduation, 
collaboration in utilising efforts made by institutions in research and development, joint conferences and workshops 
for cascading effects, and sustaining periodic industrial visits, funding of researches by industries through the 
universities.

1. Introduction 
Global demands for skilled engineers over the years had been sustained by constant need to address the dynamics of 
technology and socio-technological challenges. While the rigours of transformation of society have been lessened by 
technology and innovation proven in developed countries by training and availability of skilled engineer, most of 
developing countries of the world grapple with obsolete, inefficient traditional methods of technology 
transformation, lack of practical implementation of distributed problem-solving techniques which could be traced to 
lack of sustainable engineering education. Engineering education in the developing countries should be designed to 
enhance analytical skills, exhibition of practical ingenuity and creativity in socio-technical and operational context, 
maintenance of high standards and professionalism, leadership, business and management skills. Graduate engineer 
equipped with these abilities would never be a mismatch, but contributes adequately to sustainable development. 
The education and training of engineers begin with knowledge of elementary science through to high school 
education and to echelons of acquiring the required academic background in the institutions of higher learnings to be 
able to solve real world problems through professional and management trainings. How well the curricular content 
of engineering schools in the developing world are designed to accommodate the theory-based learning with 
complementary adequate practical trainings of professional standards is still in doubt, otherwise there should be 
appreciable key performance indicators for engineering education administration, engineering education resources 
and training, positioning engineering graduates for self-dependence or employment.  Researchers have proposed 
good solutions, but yet there should be a specific look at enhancing sustainable engineering education for the 
developing countries through university-industry collaboration. Such undertaking is imperative especially when we 
view university education as the last strata that prepares a graduate engineer to solve and manage the global dynamic 
technological changes. In this paper Nigeria will be used as a reference point since enhancing the sustainable 
education for developing countries through university-industry collaboration cannot be adequately understood on a 
global scale.

Constant demand for skilled engineers is sustained and propelled by constant need to address the dynamics of 
technology and socio-technological challenges. This demand cannot be met without enhancing sustainable 
engineering education through university-industry collaboration. Some factors, which have contributed to the decay 
in engineering education in the developing countries, are lack of political will in funding education, inadequate 
collaboration of the universities and industries for cross pollination of ideas, curricular content and programmes 
designed to pay attention to theories than practice. Good efforts had been made in this paper to explore university-
industry collaborations as one of the robust means to enhancing sustainable engineering education and practice. The 
following areas of collaboration between the industries and the universities in the developing countries had been 
identified and recommended for enhancing sustainable engineering education and practice. 
a. 
University-industry collaboration is strongly recommended in enhancing sustainable engineering education 
and practice. 
b. Establishment of institutional factories and industries to match theoretical knowledge of students with 
adequate practical training in relevant disciplines while still in school. 
c. 
Revamping students industrial work experience scheme for institutions to adequately attend to their 
students and engage them usefully. 
d. Fresh graduate engineers should be subjected to further compulsory quality training through establishment 
of graduate engineering upskilling schools. Upon training completion, certification should be obtained 
through the regulatory body. 
e. 
There should be political-will by the government and trust by the industries in funding universities, 
especially in engineering education.

Abstract 
 
In order to improve the socio-economic development of any nation, such factors as the amount and type of 
energy resources available, conversion and extraction pathways employed, the rate of utilization and 
sustainability must be addressed appropriately. Nigeria is one of the developing countries that is lagging in that 
regard because of poor and disrupted investment in the energy sector irrespective of its enormous energy 
resources. Nigeria has enormous potential in both fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. Some of these 
renewable sources include hydropower, solar energy, wind power, biomass and geothermal energy. In this 
paper, the focus is on biomass energy because it is one of the sustainable renewable energy sources with high 
extraction potentials, due to the vast arable land and favourable climatic conditions in Nigeria. The biomass 
resources found in Nigeria include agricultural resources, forest resources, aquatic biomass, and waste. These 
resources are capable of generating about 2.33 EJ of energy and about 144 million tonnes in mass, yearly, which 
can be harnessed through some pathways such as thermochemical, physio-chemical, and biochemical, for 
heating or cooling, electricity generation, and as fuel for transportation. Some authors argued that the utilization 
of the available landmass for the production of biomass resources poses a great threat to food security in 
Nigeria. However, this challenge can be offset by enhancing the existing agricultural practices to improve the 
quality of yield without tampering with the quantity of food produced. Biomass is reliable, cost-effective, 
sustainable, and has the capacity to create both direct and indirect jobs.

1. Introduction 
Despite the enormous natural and renewable energy resources scattered in all the regions in Nigeria, it is one of 
the nations that is greatly lagging with respect to meeting its energy demand. This observation is supported by a 
revelation from Oyedepo (2012) that about 60-70% of Nigerians do not have access to electrical power. And 
there can be no remarkable socio-economic and technological improvement in any nation without sufficient 
sustainable energy supply. Nigeria as a nation utilize more of natural gas, oil and coal in the production of 
power and transportation fuels for both domestic and industrial uses. However, it is established that the 
combustion of these fossil fuels releases enormous greenhouse gases (GHG) that are generating a lot of global 
concerns (Ben-Iwo et al. 2016). Some of these poisonous gases include carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and 
nitrogen oxides. When released into the atmosphere, GHGs become so detrimental to the ozone layer that 
protects the surface of the earth from direct exposure to radiations from the sun, especially the ultra violet rays 
that are both harmful to plants and humans as well. Some of these GHGs, especially the sulphur dioxide and 
nitrogen oxides can produce acid rain when in contact with water, oxygen and other chemicals. This product is 
so poisonous to both humans and animals. Consequently, there is the need to harness other low carbon 
alternatives such as biomass fuel so as to minimize these emissions during power generations (Ben-Iwo et al. 
2016).  
 
Biomass is an organic material that is derived from both plants and animals (Ben-Iwo et al. 2016), (EIA). It is a 
source of energy that is limitless in supply thus, it is renewable (Ugwu et al. 2020).  It is reliable, sustainable and 
less harmful to the environment when compared to some other sources like coal and crude oil. According to 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Nsukka, Nigeria, 5 - 7 April, 2022
IEOM Society International
746",,"Biomass is a source of energy that is limitless in supply thus, it is renewable. It can be applied or utilized greatly 
in three major ways, viz; for heating or cooling, electricity generation and as transportation fuel. About 77.8% of 
Nigeria’s land mass is available for biomass energy production. It went further to note that based on these 
technical potential estimates, the energy derivable from biomass resources is approximately 2.33 EJ. The 
bioenergy resources in Nigeria is dependent on the climatic condition prevalent in that region. For instance, 
mostly woody biomass are found in the rain forest zone while crop residues are more prevalent in the savannah 
zones. The major forms of biomass available in Nigeria are agricultural residues, aquatic biomass, fuel wood, 
wastes and energy crops. As an energy resource, biomass may be utilized in solid form or transformed through 
different technologies into liquid or gaseous forms for direct heating in homes or small scale industrial 
applications, production of electric power, steam or fuel for powering automotive engines. Such varieties of 
conversion technologies include thermo-chemical, physiochemical and bio-chemical technologies. The 
employment of bioenergy as a source of energy in Nigeria will not only reduce the high dependence on oil but 
also stimulate the quest to improve on the associated by-products and reduce the accompanying environmental 
issues with oil explorations.

Based on its 2030 vision Saudi Arabia seeks future renewable clean energy as an essential input into most industrial 
sector production processes. As a model, Neom city is targeted 100 % dependent on renewable energy, limiting 
climate change caused by CO2 emissions. On the other hand, hydrogen as a clean energy source has gained much 
attention in recent years. Moreover, hydrogen storage is considered a promising energy carrier that can be merged in 
the renewable energy system to store a large amount of energy. The research focuses on adding hydrogen storage in 
a photovoltaic (PV) plant in Neom city represents the vision ""2030"" to limit CO2 emission. Hydrogen storage could 
provide a fully renewable and clean power source for fixed and mobile applications. Must scaled-up hydrogen 
production and the legislative framework needed to define commercial deployment models explicitly. More 
technology advancements are expected to minimize the associated costs of extraction, storage, and transportation 
and more investment in the infrastructure supporting Neom city. This work presents a techno-economic study of 
adding hydrogen storage to a photovoltaic (PV) plant in Neom city. Utilizing the System Advisor Model (SAM)

Abstract 
 
Climate change has an extensive impact on human life. The increase in earth’s temperature does not only have an 
impact on rising temperatures but also changes the climate system, which affects various aspects of nature and 
human life. The attempt to restrain the pace of climate change cannot only be carried out by the state without the 
involvement of all parties. Over the past few decades, the palm oil industry has shown significant growth, especially 
in Indonesia. To deal with problems and issues of environmental damage caused by the palm oil industry, especially 
the high carbon footprint, a method or tool is needed to measure the organisation’s environmental impact. This study 
aims to calculate the Carbon Footprint generated in the business processes of a palm oil company as a trigger for 
global warming and climate change. The result of this research will be presented in the form of the carbon footprint 
on a palm oil agro-industry company’s business process, which are then analyzed using Pareto diagram to obtain the 
priority of process improvements that will be carried out.

1. Introduction 
In 2020, the average temperature in Indonesia had reached 27.3°C and was predicted to continue to rise in the year 
after. Greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for more than 90% of global climate anomalies, according to the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) fourth assessment report in 2007. The IPCC's fifth 
comprehensive assessment in 2013 stated that the increased impact of  Human activities on the climate system is 
very significant and  have been seen in various parts of the world (Luisetti et al. 2020).  
 
The amount of greenhouse gas emissions (Figure 1) produced in every human activity is called the carbon footprint  
(Luisetti et al. 2020). The higher the carbon footprint produced, the higher the concentration of greenhouse gases in 
the atmosphere. Therefore, it is essential to consider every activity carried out for the individual or company. 
According to data obtained from the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory Report and Monitoring, Reporting, 
Verification (MPV) in Figure 1.2, GHG emissions are driven by five sectors: The Energy sector, Industrial 
Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agricultural, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU), and also Waste Sector. 
Figure 1 depicts a decrease in GHG emissions in 2016 before increasing in 2018. According to the Ministry of 
Environment and Forestry, GHG emissions are extremely volatile, but the trend is upward. Human activities, both 
individual and corporate, impact these sectors significantly.

766","As shown in figure 7, scenario 1, scenario 2, scenario 3, scenario 4, and scenario 5 show a reduction of 84%, 84%, 
65%, 64% and 32%, respectively in the GWP 20 assessment. Meanwhile, on the GWP 100 assessment, the 
reduction in carbon footprint is 74%, 88%, 80%, 79%, 49%, respectively. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The best alternative in reducing the carbon footprint of the GWP 20 assessment is to convert POME to electricity. 
Meanwhile, in the GWP 100 assessment, the highest alternative value is in scenario 4, namely converting POME 
into bio-CNG, which is then used as fuel for vehicles. The three alternatives that use methane capture result in a 
significant reduction in carbon footprint, whether used for biogas, electricity, or vehicles. In order to obtain better 
results, it is necessary to use the multi-criteria decision-making method for further research. Alternative selection 
should be assessed by considering other environmental and sustainability aspects, especially in an uncertain 
environment (Sarasati and Dachyar 2021). The TOPSIS multi-criteria method can generate a closeness coefficient 
concerning relevant factors' weighted value and ranks the alternative performance (Sahir and Dachyar 2021). As a 
result, different experts must evaluate and choose the best alternative based on various criterias.

Abstract 
 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc on various sectors worldwide affecting people with 
compromised immunity. A healthy diet plan should include adequate levels of select micronutrients and 
macronutrients to enhance immunity. Although dietary habits can be modified, the cost of nutritious food has been a 
significant challenge to Filipino adults due to its cost. Through Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), a low-
cost healthy meal plan is developed following the recommended nutritional intake of a healthy adult. 120 survey 
respondents aged 19-50 years old from National Capital Region (NCR) initially participated in this study. After 
exclusion criteria for defined healthy adults, eligible participants proceeded in the second phase. Data collection on 
socio-demographic, anthropometry and the participants’ food intake was accomplished. Long-term dietary habits 
were acquired through the 24-hour Food Recall Record and Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). A majority of 
female respondents did not reach the recommended daily intake of Vitamin A(465±519.44mcg), Vitamin 
D(24±61.12IU/mcg), 
Vitamin 
C(72±156.96mg), 
Vitamin 
E(18±32.90mg), 
Zinc(14±8.02mg), 
Selenium(110±108.77mcg), and daily protein intake. The same with the majority of male respondents in Vitamins 
A(462±417.40mcg), D(19±31.20IU/mcg), C(50±48.18mg), E(22±38.94mg), and Protein. The remaining 391 food 
items were the variables in the model with 31 constraints and four models were optimized for both males and 
females which resulted in a 7-day meal plan. The model optimization identified food items in a minimum cost of 
₱68.75 and ₱69.08 for Males aged 19-29 and 30-50 years old, respectively. For females, a cost of ₱71.13 (for aged 
19-29) and ₱82.57 (for aged 30-50 years old) were obtained.

1. Introduction  
Epidemic outbreaks are distinct from other cataclysms because of two different characteristics: long-term 
disturbance and exponential increase. Failure to manage such disasters creates significant disruptions in supply 
chains and populations, resulting in irreversible losses. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of these 
disasters that has wreaked havoc on supply chains worldwide, especially in the healthcare industry (Govindan, 
Mina, and Alavi, 2020). COVID-19 is an acute illness, but it can be fatal in extreme cases. It was identified last 
December 2019 in Wuhan, China, which has infected 26 countries worldwide (Xu et al., 2020). The World Health 
Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international significance. In 215 
countries, over 3 million injuries were reported, and over 200,000 deaths were confirmed by May 2, 2020. Despite 
the closing of critical transport borders, reported cases and deaths are emerging, possibly because of population 
transmission and expanded ability for research (Nzediegwu and Chang, 2020). COVID-19 symptoms can range 
from asymptomatic to severe cases, including coughing, fever, and shortness of breath (Rothan and Byrareddy, 
2020). Acute respiratory failure syndrome, acute coronary problems, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic 
shock, and death are possible symptoms in more severe cases. The outbreak of this new infectious disease has been 
moving rapidly (Bansal, 2020; Singhal, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Kochi, Tagliari, Forleo, Fassini, and Tondo, 2020). 
To combat the epidemic, strict nationwide policies have been adopted, including social distancing policies and

Abstract 
 
 
This research aimed to use the business model canvas approach as a kind of business strategy planning to establish 
the stages of DAKGÈ's business development. The stages of research carried out are as follows: (1) conducting 
market research and determining business ideas, (2) creating a business model canvas and value proposition canvas, 
(3) validating business models, (4) running business processes and implementing several plans for business model 
canvas, too (5) analyzing business performance. The research design used is applied research with an action research 
approach and qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. From the results of this study, it was found that 
the business model canvas has an important role to support the overall business process and help DAKGÈ to achieve 
fairly optimal performance.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, customers connect with the company with various platform channels, online and offline, especially in 
online media, which offer many opportunities for the company to develop their communication for many objectives 
to their target market, such as increasing sales volume and increasing number of customers (Deborah et al., 2021). 
Moreover, the Covid-19 pandemic that occurs in 2020 remains a global issues emphasis the company to conduct 
their business creatively to attract their customers and better than competitors to gain competitive advantages. Many 
small creative businesses can survive pandemics by developing their product and finding opportunities based on the 
behavior of their target market (Alvin et al., 2021; Putri et al., 2021). Creating a business also needs deep knowledge, 
known as hard-skill and soft-skill. Entrepreneurs who have both hard-skill and soft-skill are persistent in the volatile 
business environment (Sudirman et al., 2020). Creating a Business Model Canvas (BMC) before establishing a 
business is very important to help the entrepreneur better understand how the business works, internal factors, and 
external factors (Brittney, 2021). The entrepreneur also can create a mind mapping to elaborate their idea to support 
their business model and create value for their business (Ratnapuri et al., 2021). 
 
Therefore, as a new small business, DAKGÈ arranged its strategies and plans using Business Model Canvas (BMC) 
approach before entering the culinary industry. The culinary industry in Indonesia is multiplying. The citizens 
increasingly favor various types of unique foods and beverages, such as bubble tea, coffee, dessert boxes, salmon 
mentai, various kinds of street food, and other types of fusion food. However, without realizing it, these viral 
culinary delights also seem to have side effects that are not good for health (Pamelia, 2018). 
 
Moreover, most people still face difficulties living a healthy lifestyle caused by various factors, such as limited 
knowledge, the comparatively high cost of healthy food, its difficulty in obtaining, and a lack of commitment to 
changing lifestyles (Rezkisari, 2015). To solve those problems, DAKGÈ comes up with innovative solutions through 
various practical and affordable healthy culinary. The development of this healthy culinary business aims to 
encourage young Indonesians to start living a healthy lifestyle.

791","5.1 Overall Business Performance 
After running the business for about seven months—from March until September 2021—and implementing the 
plans based on the Business Model Canvas created, we did the analysis and evaluation related to DAKGÈ’s business 
performance. Although some of the plans could not be implemented during the period, the business process still 
could run smoothly. The business growth performance dashboard summarizes DAKGÈ’s overall business 
performance, including the financial and marketing aspects, as represented in figure 4. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Business Growth Performance Dashboard of DAKGÈ 
 
From March until August 2021, we sold the products with the pre-order system held at least once a month. We 
created the promotional content on social media and shared it with our friends also family. The highest sales 
performance is on March 2021 because we did the sales activity every week, while from April until August 2021, 
we could not do it consistently due to the pandemic and other problems we faced. So, the sales performance was not 
stable, and we were looking for a way to solve the problems. Then, from September 2021, we successfully became a 
partner of Indonesia's online food delivery platforms, such as GoFood and GrabFood. It was also one of the plans 
based on the Business Model Canvas. From the revenue performance chart, we could see that the online food 
delivery platform showed a significant increase in September, and we got some new customers from the platforms. 
As shown in the picture, the total products sold was 333 with total revenue of Rp. 6,324,908, and the average profit 
margin percentage was 24.58%, classified as good. We successfully got 58 new customers during the period, and 
based on the survey, 77.41% of the total customers were satisfied with our products. Our top-selling product was 
Fruit’s Bomb, a bottled layered juice with popping boba and silky pudding. We did the marketing activities through 
our social media platforms, especially Instagram. We actively uploaded some engaging and informative content and 
successfully gained a 1.95% engagement rate. The overall business performance based on implementing the 
Business Model Canvas could be considered good. However, we still need to improve our business strategy and 
performance to develop the business in the future. 
 
6. Conclusion 
DAKGÈ is a new small-medium enterprise in the healthy culinary industry based in Bandung, Indonesia. It is 
important to create Value Proposition Canvas and Business Model Canvas as a new business to validate the business 
idea and analyze the business model. Based on the research, DAKGÈ's business idea aligns with the target market's

products. Moreover, there are many opportunities to enter the industry where people start to realize the importance 
of a healthy lifestyle due to the pandemic. During the implementation, Business Model Canvas (BMC) helps 
DAKGÈ to arrange its plans and strategies. Although many things could not be realized due to the lack of resources, 
cost, and time, Business Model Canvas (BMC) is adequate to support DAKGÈ's overall business performance.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is located on the Ring of Fire and has a huge thermal potential of up to 29,000 MW, which is equivalent to 
40% of the world's geothermal potential capacity. According to the latest records from the Geological Agency, 
Indonesia's geothermal potential in December 2019 was 23.9 gigawatts (GW). According to the Geothermal 
Authority (2019), this potential can only be used for a total potential of 8.9%, or 2,130.6. MW. Even though the 
government itself is targeting an increase in geothermal utilization to 7,241.5 MW or 16.8% of the total potential 
capacity in 2025, there is still much that has not been utilized. CNN Indonesia (2016) stated the expansion of 
geothermal energy as a source of renewable energies requires a long time and very high risk. Capital will return in 
the long term and investors will not explore much in this business. As a result, only a few investors are interested in 
developing geothermal energy in Indonesia. It is necessary to analyze the project financing to assess whether a 
geothermal project is feasible or not. In this study, data that were used are qualitative and quantitative data such as 
using a questionnaire given to experts, policy makers, and producers. This study identifies geothermal project 
feasibility and calculates the capital return estimation using project financing and capital budgeting method.

1. Introduction 
Renewable energy is energy that comes from renewable energy sources, namely geothermal energy, wind, 
bioenergy, sunlight, water currents, waterfalls, movement of temperature differences in the ocean layers, and others, 
which are sustainable energy sources if managed properly (Indonesian Law No. 30 of 2007 concerning Energy).  
Indonesia is located on the Ring of Fire and has a huge thermal potential of up to 29,000 MW, which is equivalent to 
40% of the world's geothermal potential capacity. According to the latest records from the Geological Agency, 
Indonesia's geothermal potential in December 2019 was 23.9 gigawatts (GW). According to the Geothermal 
Authority (2019), this potential can only be used for a total potential of 8.9%, or 2,130.6. MW. Even though the 
government itself is targeting an increase in geothermal utilization to 7,241.5 MW or 16.8% of the total potential 
capacity in 2025, there is still much that has not been utilized as shown on figure 1.  
 
Geothermal energy is known as renewable energy which has been processed in Indonesia for almost 100 years. The 
Netherlands has drilled the first geothermal well in Kamojang since 1926, and the first geothermal power plant has 
been in operation since 1983. However, the expansion of geothermal energy is a problem, because it is difficult to 
compete with relatively cheap fossil fuel power plants. With the depletion of production and availability of fossil 
fuels, the development of new and renewable energy (NRE) technologies further reduces the cost of developing an 
NRE system and makes it possible to compete with fossil fuels (Directorate General of EBTKE, Ministry of Energy 
and Mineral Resources, 2020).

6.  Conclusion and Recommendations 
Based on data analysis and discussion that had been done, it can be concluded about the feasibility study of 
geothermal development project as follows: 
 
1.  The capital expenditure needed for geothermal development project is the same for three financing scenario 
with initial investment at 253.000.000  US Dollar and investment after COD at 192.000.000 US Dollar. 
 
2.  Geothermal development project is feasible and accepted to be executed for financing scenario 2 and 3 even the 
discounted payback period of financing scenario 2 is rejected. The project will unfeasible if the project run by 
financing scenario 1 as shown in Table 7. 
 
3.  Financing structure 3 give the best economic value of geothermal business development project. The NPV of 
financing structure 3 is amounting to 52.819.000 US Dollar, IRR is 9,61%, Discounted Payback Period is 7,61 
years and the Profitability Index is 2.86.

The definition of the term decolonization will be explored and will be followed by the characterization of current 
colonization practices and dynamics. More precisely the current value chain perspective will be analyzed to compare 
and contrast with the corporate valuation versus the people valuation in some supply chain industries. The research 
will rely on literature review as well as secondary data of published case studies. The results of this work will help 
pave the road for more work in this under-served research track in supply chain management especially regarding the 
underpinning dynamics of modern colonial practices in global south supply chains. In addition, the analysis will shed 
some light on the challenges facing practitioners and policy makers to better plan for and correct important issues of 
power, finance and labor in today’s supply chains. Finally, it is hopeful that this work will reveal some ethical 
problems in the field of supply chain management that will open the door for further research and different scholastic 
and practical discussions.

Abstract  
 
This paper reports a structural equation model in which total productive maintenance (TPM), just-in-time (JIT), 
overall equipment efficiency (OEE) indexes are analyzed as latent independent variables how they affect the 
economic sustainability (ES) of the companies through the flow of materials their disruptions. The variables are 
related using six hypotheses in the model, evaluated with information from 239 responses to a questionnaire applied 
to the Mexican maquiladora industry. The partial least squares technique is applied to validate these hypotheses. The 
results indicate that TPM is highly related to JIT, SE, OEE, likewise, JIT has a direct relationship with OEE SE. It is 
concluded that lean manufacturing tools applied to materials flow in a production system must be highly monitored 
to avoid disruptions that affect the economic income of companies.

1. Introduction  
Industrial companies play an essential role in the economic sustainability of countries society, so it is vital to 
manage their operational administrative practices correctly. Specifically, in Mexico, there are programs focused on 
improving the industry, resulting in foreign companies establishing subsidiaries in the national territory transforming 
raw materials, since it has a high level of skilled labor, proximity to the United States of America Canada; in 
addition, there are free trade agreements between these nations (García-Alcaraz et al., 2015). These subsidiary 
companies are called maquiladoras. 
 
In December 2021, Mexico had 5188 maquiladora companies throughout the country, of which 487 were located in 
the state of Chihuahua, with Ciudad Juarez being the most represented region with 322 industries, equivalent to 
6.2% nationally (INDEX, 2022b). These companies in Ciudad Juarez employ 327,253 workers, which reflects the 
importance of this sector within the regional economy society (INDEX, 2022a). 
These industries apply different philosophies in their production lines supply chain to survive in the highly 
competitive markets, focusing their resources on alternatives that allow them to have effective processes, both in 
terms of saving materials without disruptions, shorter process times, waste reduction. One of the strategies is 
applying the lean manufacturing methodology, a set of tools to address problems associated with standardization, 
material flow, quality, integration of human resources. Thus, companies' benefits are reflected in their production 
processes, prevent disruptions that affect supply chains, promote economic sustainability (Jimenez et al., 2019).

Abstract 
 
The mental health of students has become an important concern since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the 
research on the influence of mental impact on students' achievement in online learning is still very limited, 
especially in relation to the motivation of students. This study which was conducted from July to August 2021, 
examines the relationship between e-learning challenges and limited interaction during online lectures on student 
motivation and satisfaction. Respondents came from 3 Universities in Banten Province, Indonesia, totaling 425 
students consisting of 280 males (65.9%) and 145 females (34.1%). Respondents who reported their perceptions 
during online learning varied in grade, range from grade 1 to 4. Descriptive analysis shows that satisfaction level of 
respondents taking online lectures is 3.36 which is categorized fairly satisfied. From Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) analysis it is indicated that there is an effect of challenge e-learning on students' learning motivation, but on 
the contrary there is no interaction effect on students' learning motivation. An interesting finding was that there was 
no direct effect of e-learning challenge, interaction or motivation on student satisfaction. However, research shows 
that there is an effect of e-learning challenge and interaction on student satisfaction through intermediate variable 
motivation. Thus, it is important to consider the factors affecting student motivation, namely internet connection, 
learning environment, and development of interactive electronic content as the leverage for the improvement of the 
effectiveness of online learning.

1. Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic is an important factor that has serious impact on education today. More than 190 
countries have implemented lockdowns, thus affecting the learning system for more than 90% of the world's student 
population (UNESCO, 2013). COVID-19 pandemic of course has bigger impact on the learning system of 
developing countries, including Indonesia. The lack of readiness and infrastructure in developing countries in 
dealing with new learning systems has significant impact on the teaching and learning system. Since the Covid-19 
pandemic hit, the Indonesian government has set a policy of study from home. The Indonesian government 
facilitates schools in order to make them to be able to conduct e-learning in their educational service. E-learning and 
online learning are often used interchangeably. Online learning is also known by other terms such as blended 
learning, online education, web-based education, web-based instruction and online courses (Singh andThurman, 
2019). In this study online learning means uploading material on online platforms to teach the students by using 
various software applications such as Zoom and Google Meet (Miller,  et al, 2017). 
Online education has lower quality stigma than face-to-face. In order to improve the quality of online learning, it is 
necessary to consider 4 important factors, namely: communication dynamics, e-learning-environmental factors, 
organizational factors and personality/situational factors (Yunusa and Umar, 2021). Online learning has more 
challenges than face-to-face learning, among others are technical difficulties (Yeung, 2021), efforts to stay focused 
during lectures (Richardson et al, 2017), assessment and evaluation problems.

818","environment, when teachers and peers are physically absent, this will affect their motivation. Although the student-
content interaction in online lectures showed a moderate level (3.18), it did not affect their motivation to participate 
in e-learning. This also shows that the tools used in online learning, although not the same effective as offline 
learning, does not affect students' motivation to participate in e-learning. An interesting thing of the findings in this 
study is that although there are limitations to student-friend interaction, students- teachers and especially the 
limitations of student-content interaction, it turns out that this does not affect students' motivation to take online 
lectures. Thus, student motivation to take e-learning courses is influenced by: difficulty focusing, difficulty adapting 
with tools. While motivation to take e-learning lectures is not affected by student-student, student-teacher and 
student content interactions. 
 
This study shows that there is an effect of e-learning challenges on satisfaction through motivation. This shows that 
the e-learning challenge variable does not directly affect student satisfaction, but through the intermediate variable 
motivation. This implies the important role of independent learning which is characterized by motivation, where the 
learner's motivation has the strongest effect on student satisfaction (Hettiarachchi, 2021). This study has 
implications for ensuring that students are highly motivated as independent learners, so that various challenges do 
not become obstacles to achieve online learning satisfaction. Therefore, it is necessary to create an effective student-
friendly learning model. The quality online learning experience is much influenced by the presence of interactive 
electronic content such as video clips, forums, and quizzes which is very important (Kumar, 2021). 
The results also show that there is an interaction effect on satisfaction through motivation. Factors that influence 
student satisfaction are the role of the instructor and teacher-student interaction. Higher interaction in online learning 
leads to higher student satisfaction (Dinh and Nguyen, 2020). This is in line with research (Chen, 2020), which 
states that student-content interaction is important in online lectures, where easy student access to electronic content 
is a major determinant of student satisfaction in online learning (Bervel et al., 2019). Overall this interaction affects 
satisfaction through motivation. 
 
6. Conclusions  
The research findings show that there is an effect of e-learning challenges on motivation. Difficulty in adapting, 
difficulty in focusing during online lectures and the use of technological tools during online lectures which are less 
effective than physical meetings, apparently affect the motivation of students to take online lectures. This shows that 
the level of e-learning challenges has not been fully managed optimally by students so that it has an impact on their 
motivation. When students are faced with a new learning process (online), students still need time to reach the 
steady state stage on their learning curve, in order to understand and adapt to online learning. 
Subsequent research findings indicate that there is no interaction effect on motivation. Although students have 
limited interaction with lecturers, content and friends during e-learning, this does not affect their motivation to take 
online lectures. Mainly, although student-content interaction is low, it does not affect their motivation to attend 
online lectures. 
 
An interesting finding is that there is no direct effect of e-learning challenges, interactions on student satisfaction. In 
addition, the research findings also show that there is no direct effect of motivation on student satisfaction. These 
results are in accordance with the findings of the research done by Amabile et al. (1994) which states that people can 
be simultaneously intrinsically and extrinsically motivated, but it may or may not have a relationship with job 
satisfaction. Likewise, research by Deci and Ryan (1985) found that intrinsic or extrinsic motivation may or may not 
have a relationship with job satisfaction. 
 
However, the research shows that there is an effect of e-learning challenge on student satisfaction through the 
intermediate variable motivation, and there is an interaction effect on student satisfaction through intermediate 
variable motivation. This shows the motivation variable is an important intermediate variable in order to achieve 
student satisfaction. Therefore, it is important to notice the factors that influence motivation, especially connections 
and the home environment. Thus, the leverage factors for student motivation are internet connection, learning 
environment, and the development of interactive electronic content. 
 
The findings contribute to universities in Indonesia to see the impact of the shift from classroom-based education to 
online-based ones, which have been implemented during the pandemic of Covid-19. Nevertheless, this study also 
has some limitations. First, the research design is cross sectional, where the questionnaires are collected at a certain

826","time. In fact, students' perceptions of e-learning satisfaction can change over time and as students become fluent in 
using technology in e-learning. Second, a larger number of respondents will be better to represent the findings.

Abstract  
 
Automotive is one of the competitive industries supported by its significant technological advancement, but it is 
susceptible to disruption trends. In Indonesia, the automotive industry has many vehicle segments. One of them is 
the Medium Sport Utility Vehicle (MSUV) segment. The disruption phenomenon occurred in the Medium Sport 
Utility Vehicle segment due to the emergence of the X brand in 2019, enabled by disruptive technologies to 
challenge and gain the Y brand’s market share as the incumbents. Therefore, there is an urgency to determine 
disruptive technology used in the automotive industry. This research utilizes Multi-Criteria Decision Making 
(MCDM) method combining Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Others Reference by Similarity 
to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The main results showed that Government Regulation was the most important criterion, 
while Electric Vehicles became the most preferred alternative for disruptive technology selection in the automotive 
industry. This research arguably has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this research was the first 
attempt to determine disruptive technology used in the automotive industry, while practically, this research could 
guide the automotive manufacturer to select the most disruptive technology while considering some critical criteria 
during the research and development process.

1. Introduction  
In this modern era, car ownership has been a primary need. Car as one of the transportation types is preferred due to 
its convenience compared to a motorcycle. Despite its convenience, the car price is relatively higher than a 
motorcycle. Customers tend to purchase a low-cost car of good quality. This becomes a strategic concern for 
automotive manufacturers requiring them to deliver good products and services to customers while also tightening 
their budget at the same time.  
 
The automotive industry comprises design, supply, manufacture, sales, and after-sales service to customers (Fathi 
and Ahmadian 2016). Automotive is one of the competitive industries supported by its significant technological 
advancement (Cinicioglu et al. 2012). Its industry is susceptible to new technology and disruption trend. Disruption 
is a process whereby a smaller firm with fewer resources could challenge the incumbent’s businesses (Christensen et 
al. 2015). Disruptive innovation originates in two types, the first is a low-end market, and the other is a new market 
(Christensen et al. 2015). A low-end market exists because the incumbents pay less attention to less-demanding 
customers. In contrast, a new market emerges because the new entrant creates a new market that non exists before 
(Christensen et al. 2015).  
 
In Indonesia, the automotive industry plays a vital role in manufacturing, while the manufacturing sector contributes 
significantly to Indonesia’s economic growth (Nurcahyo and Wibowo 2015). There are many vehicle segments in 
the Indonesian automotive industry, such as Large Sport Utility Vehicle (LSUV), Medium Sport Utility Vehicle 
(MSUV), Low Multi-Purpose Vehicle (LMPV), Medium Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MMPV), and many others.

829","6. Conclusion 
This research aimed to determine disruptive technology used in the automotive industry using the Multi-Criteria 
Decision Making (MCDM) method. The criteria used for disruptive technology selection were Government 
Regulation, Cost, User-Friendly, Technology Classification, Value Proposition, and Infrastructure. Furthermore, 
alternatives used were Electric Vehicles, Connected Cars, and Autonomous Driving. The research resulted in criteria 
ranking (weight) as follows: Government Regulation (0.41), Cost (0.22), User-Friendly (0.16), Technology 
Classification (0.08), Value Proposition (0.07), and Infrastructure (0.06). The findings showed the most important 
criteria during disruptive technology selection was Government Regulation. On the other hand, the research also 
resulted in alternatives ranking (preference) as follows: Electric Vehicle (0.82), Connected Car (0.55), and 
Autonomous Driving (0.27). The findings showed the most preferred alternative was Electric Vehicles. 
 
This research arguably has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this research was the first attempt 
to determine disruptive technology used in the automotive industry. Practically, this research could guide the 
automotive manufacturer to select the most disruptive technology while considering some critical criteria during the 
research and development process. The limitations of this research are the lack of automotive manufacturers that 
have done using disruptive technologies. Hence, future research could gather more automotive manufacturers using 
disruptive technologies and consider other critical criteria during the disruptive technology selection.

Abstract 
 
The oil and gas drilling process in its implementation has a work agreement contract process that will affect 
activities from drilling services into organizational income. In this paper, the authors conduct research on the 
business processes that occur in a drilling service organization in the revenue line, such as making billing documents 
for the work done. We validate the equality of information criteria with experts in the administration of drilling 
services with information criteria in public administration. Finally, the business processes that occur and the 
comparison of the duration of the process in the drilling service standard with the realization process are also 
described to identify the problem and determine the possibility for business processes development with BPR. The 
information criteria in the revenue administration process in the drilling service sector can be said to be the same as 
the information criteria in public administration. so that information must be correct, comprehensive, actual, and 
accessible. for further research, business process reengineering may be needed in the revenue drilling service line. 
Thus, it can also be concluded that Business process reengineering can be carried out on business processes in this 
drilling service.

1. Introduction 
Oil and gas in Indonesia are needed components for the sustainability of the activities of the Indonesian people. The 
international energy agency predicts that the demand for oil and gas will continue to increase until the middle of the 
21st century. Over the past 20 years the demand for oil and gas has grown rapidly, and dependence on oil and gas 
imports has increased (Li Guoxin et al. 2020). In order to meet this demand, oil and gas drilling service 
organizations must be prepared to face the increasing demands. Increasing demand forces organizations to innovate 
continuously in response to changes that occur (Xinbo Sun et al. 2021).  
 
In order to make billing documents in drilling services, the documentation of drilling service is needed for 
administration process. Based on (Patrik T. et al. 2020), administration is is needed for all industrial activities as a 
supporting process. It’s a process whose purpose is to manage administrative needs.  
 
This research will take a case study at Indonesian oil and gas drilling services organization, there is work to be done 
and there are wages for work. As a drilling service provider organization that has many customers, it has 
administration that tends to refer to speed and validity. With the use of technology used in the company for the 
billing process it is still classified as manual, this cause widespread effects of human error for repetitive activities. 
Inefficient activities such as making sudden reports by workers who are taking care of administrative activities also 
occur, one of which is due to incomplete integration in processes that are not visible and influential. For example, 
such as billing activities to customers which require attaching many minutes, and there may be several amendments 
or changes to the agreed contract but at that time there is also a request for another report so that many errors are 
found in the process and cause data processing from a location that produces a value from a work is not right. The 
drilling service organization currently has business processes that have an impact on the administrative process since 
the site work is completed and until the billing document is completed. The process that is currently running is a

7. Crew CSAM 1 then retrieves the physical pre-invoice document and scans the document after that

8. Crew CSAM 2 recaps data from clear pre-invoices, and scans pre-invoices for submitting clear pre-

9. Crew finance 1 makes a logbook/list for a clear pre-invoice and sends a logbook/list soft copy via 
email, after that submits a clear soft file pre-invoice which was previously sent by crew csam 2 to the 
crew finance region owned by the user 
10. The crew finance region user verifies the soft copy and makes a notification for revision for lack of 
documents, after that a notification is made to the drilling service to make a request to the SSC (central 
finance belongs to the organization) 
11. The next process, the process of making invoices, receipts, tax invoices is carried out when a 
notification has been received from the crew finance region user, and after that completes the physical 
pre-invoice document with invoices, receipts, tax invoices that have been made, then scans the 
complete file and submits it back soft copy and hard copy. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Refer to the data, specifically to Figure 3 and table 3, it can be concluded that for the processes that occur in the 
drilling service organization, it can be related to some of the most popular best practices from business process 
reengineering. It can be seen that several revisions occur, it can be related to task elimination, where revisions are 
possible only once. For processes related to task composition, several processes can be combined, such as 
combining the documents needed for verification at certain stages. integrally technology and integration of these 
best practices, it can be concluded that the work between the user and the drilling service can be done by integrating 
between organizations with the use of technology to reduce the limitations that occur because previously it was done 
physically in the business process. In the performance indicator table, it can be seen in Table 2 that every year there 
is an increase in billing data units. This indicates that every year there is an increase in demand for drilling services. 
 
The information criteria in the revenue administration process in the drilling service sector can be said to be the 
same as the information criteria in public administration. so that information must be correct, comprehensive, actual, 
and accessible. for further research, business process reengineering may be needed in the revenue drilling service 
line. Thus, it can also be concluded that Business process reengineering can be carried out on business processes in 
this drilling service.

Abstract 
 
This article presents a bibliometric analysis of social life cycle assessment (S-LCA), which has gained importance 
due to the need to know the social impact of business operations on persons. Using the PRISMA methodology, we 
identified 190 documents regarding SLCA in the SCOPUS database and were analyzed with the VOSviewer 
software. Specifically, the most cited documents, authors, organizations, and countries are analyzed and the most 
productive according to the number published. This analysis included the most used keywords are analyzed on the 
S-LCA topic. Findings indicate that this topic has become relevant since 2007, and currently, the number of 
scientific publications has an exponential trend. It has been identified that Traverso M. is the author who has 19 
products with 603 citations; however, Guyton R.A. is the most cited author with only two papers and 813 citations. 
The institution that publishes the most on this topic is the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Spain), with three papers 
and 108 citations. Authors from 46 countries were identified, but the most productive are Italy and Germany, and the 
most cited are the United States of America and Germany. A total of 1625 keywords were identified, but life cycle 
assessment, social life cycle assessment, and sustainable development are the most used.

1. Introduction 
The life cycle assessment (LCA) of a product is a methodology that identifies, quantifies, and characterizes the 
different environmental impacts associated with each of the stages of a product's life cycle (Rodríguez, 2003), which 
agrees with Eurofins (2021), who adds the potential impacts of any activity to the LCA concept. Therefore, the LCA 
makes it possible to know the critical operations of the production processes and thus seek alternative solutions that 
contribute to and promote sustainable production from an environmental approach. 
 
One of these potential impacts is the human factor, so LCA now integrates the social aspect, called social life cycle 
assessment (S-LCA). Research on S-LCA has increased and gained international academic and scientific acceptance 
in recent decades. S-LCA is defined by Huertas-Valdivia, Ferrari, Settembre-Blundo, and García-Muiña (2020) as ""a 
technique for collecting, analyzing and communicating information on the social conditions and impacts associated 
with production and consumption.""

From the analysis of the words used to index the documents, it is concluded that social life cycle assessment, 
sustainability, life cycle assessment, life cycle sustainability assessment, and social impacts are the most used.  
Perhaps because it is the most published journal on this topic, the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment 
and the Journal of Cleaner Production is the most cited on S-LCA. On the other hand, the most cited authors are 
Guyton, R.A., Halkos, M.E., Kin, H., among others. However, to institutions, the most cited are Emory University 
(United States), Griffith University (Australia), Universität Stuttgart (Germany), Greendelta TC (Germany), and the 
Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden). The most cited are the United States of America, Germany, Italy, Sweden, 
Brazil, and Spain when integrating these institutions. 
 
Given the above, Latin American, and African countries have very few publications and citations; however, they are 
centers where outsourced manufacturing operations are carried out, so it is convenient to start studying the social 
impact of industrial operations in those countries.

Abstract  
 
In Indonesia, in terms of population, Generation Z is the largest. The number reached 72.8 million (27 percent) of 
Indonesia's 267 million population in 2019, and the results of Lokadata.id's processing of the 2019 National Socio-
Economic Survey (Susenas) revealed that of the 47 million millennial internet users, as many as 17 percent or 
around 7.8 million of them like shopping online, whether it's buying goods or services. With approximately 4.7 
hours per day to access the internet, the activity for conducting online-based transactions has also increased. In 
essence, various past and present factors influence consumers. Future decisions will be influenced by current 
behavior. If a consumer is satisfied with the product he bought, then he tends to buy it again. But if you are not 
satisfied with a certain brand product. Consumer behavior can be influenced by several factors such as social factors, 
personal factors, and psychological factors. Tokopedia is an Indonesian E-commerce company with a mission to 
achieve economic equality digitally. Since its founding in 2009, Tokopedia has been a pioneer in digital 
transformation in the country. Quoted from IPrice, Tokopedia remains the most visited E-commerce in the 3rd 
quarter of 2021. The purpose of this study is to determine consumer behavior towards purchasing decisions for 
fashion at Tokopedia. The research method used is linear regression test using SPSS. The result of this study is that 
consumer behavior has a significant effect on purchasing decisions for fashion products at Tokopedia.

1. Introduction  
The rise of internet use is not only used by Indonesian people to find issues and communicate, but also used for 
economic activities. Buying and selling transactions that were originally done by meeting directly between sellers 
and buyers, are now starting to change. The process of buying and selling goods and services can be done on the 
grasp of fingers based on electro networks. That's what E-Commerce claims. The presence of E-Commerce makes it 
very easy for people, if they want to buy a product, in terms of businesspeople, they can further expand their market 
reach. The spread of news about a product can be done more quickly, and has a very wide scope, so this is starting to 
shift the pattern and way of consumption and has even become part of people's lifestyles.

Abstract 
 
Lazada is an e-commerce platform that provides online shopping(Fachmi et al., 2019) services that aim to make it 
easier for customers to find the desired item(Pratama et al., 2019). Service quality is one of the keys to the success 
of a company in achieving customer loyalty to re-order again(Science, 2021). Therefore, this study aims to 
determine the effect of service quality and brand image on repurchase decision of Lazada e-commerce users as 
international students I this case who live in Bandung. by using a purposive sampling technique aimed at 100 
respondents who have shopped through the Lazada application. The data analysis technique used is descriptive and 
causal analysis, classical assumptions, simple linear regression, and hypothesis testing. The results show that: 
service quality has a significant effect on repurchase decision , brand image has a significant effect on repurchase 
decision, In addition, both, service quality and brand image  has  a significant  effect on repurchase decision. Lazada 
must improve the customers service by doing training for their employees to meet the customers’ expectations, and, 
Lazada must increase the advantages of the products provided on the platform, by finding trusted brand partners 
who have the best products quality.

Abstract 
 
One of the most important parts of the supply chain is the supplier. Suppliers play a role in supplying raw materials 
that will be used in the production, it is necessary to make a selection in selecting suppliers to get the criteria that 
consumers want. Several criteria are considered when selecting suppliers; quality, prices and  on-time delivery. To 
maintain the above criteria, especially quality, it is necessary to evaluate and  monitor suppliers. Various 
manufacturers already have supplier quality monitoring systems but have not considered in detail the critical level of 
non-conformity that occurs in raw materials and if there is a quality problem, the Quality Control section is often 
slow in making decisions so there can be a decrease in product quality. Therefore, this research is conducted to 
obtain a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the design of a supplier quality monitoring system and provide 
alternative options in handling quality problems in supplier’s raw materials that occur with quick and precise 
decision making. To design a supplier quality control system that considers the level of non-conformity, the method 
used is Quality Function Deployment (QFD). In this study, Voice of Customers (VOC) were obtained through 
experts’ interviews in the field of quality to find out the manufacturer's wishes regarding the actions taken for 
handling non-conformity according to the level and level of importance for the customer. Meanwhile, for technical 
requirements, it is a list of several actions/follow-ups that will be carried out to suppliers.

1. Introduction 
One of the important components in the supply chain is supplier. Suppliers play a role in supplying raw materials or 
parts that will be used in the production process in the manufacturing process, therefore making a decision in 
selecting suppliers is required in order to obtain the criteria that customers desire. When selecting suppliers, several 
criteria are taken into account, including quality, competitive price, and on-time delivery. The results of supplier’s 
performance evaluation will determine whether the contract is terminated or renewed.  
 
According to ISO 9000:2015, non-conformity is defined as a failure to fulfill specifications or standards. Non-
conformity can also be defined as an unexpected and unwelcome event that can lead to divergence (Alatulkkila, 
2018). Monitoring of non-conformity is an efficient method for assisting manufacturers in meeting quality 
objectives and improving product quality (Claver et al., 2003; Majanoja et al., 2017). Based on the conditions 
observed in the field, non-conformity occurs in the quality of raw materials from suppliers cannot be predicted so it 
must be handled immediately and take appropriate corrective action to be carried out as soon as possible by the 
Quality Control Department in manufacturing.  
 
Most of the previous studies solely looked at quality monitoring in terms of defect ratio, they haven’t yet considered 
the critical level of non-conformity that occurs in raw materials. If there is a quality problem, the Quality Control 
Department is often slow in making decisions which can lead to a decrease in product quality. Based on these two 
factors, the problem that will be raised in this research is that there is still a limited discussion regarding the supplier 
quality monitoring system that takes into account the level of non-conformity, particularly on the critical side, which 
will greatly help control and improve supplier quality for raw materials to be supplied.

6. Conclusion 
This research aims to obtain working procedures for supplier quality monitoring system design and provide 
alternative options in handling of quality problems in raw materials from suppliers that occur with quick and precise 
decision making. This was done by doing literature studies on supplier quality monitoring system, non-conformity 
classification and  validation and also designing a supplier quality monitoring system that considers the level of non-
conformity, which is carried out in collaboration with experts from the AC Business Unit. The results of this system 
design shows that the appropriate handling steps for suppliers for the critical levels of non-conformity are supplier 
audit and  supplier training, for major levels are supplier audit and  collaborative teams and for minor levels are 
Corrective Action Requests (CAR) form and  5 why analysis and collaborative team. This study can provide 
guidance Quality Department in manufacturing to increase the effectiveness of corrective actions against non-
conformity so that corrective actions taken to suppliers can be carried out quickly and there is no decrease in product 
quality.

Abstract 
 
Distance learning has been advancing in today’s time given the continuous enhancement of technology in the world. 
Moreover, with the COVID-19 Pandemic that hit nationwide, the education sector had to turn to distance learning to 
save the education of students in this generation. The research aims to analyze how engineering students’ personal 
and academic experiences under an unusual online set-up create an impact on their well-being as an individual. 
Through the dissemination of survey questionnaires to the students, the researchers will measure the results through 
statistical analysis. With that, the independent variables identified in the study are manipulated into WarpPLS to 
foresee their relationship with the determined dependent variable through Structural Equation Modeling. It enables a 
concrete evaluation of which factors affect a student of abundant or sparse weight.

1. Introduction 
Online learning has emerged as a solution to the dilemma facing the education sector after the start of the COVID-
19 pandemic. However, despite the countermeasures, challenges throughout the journey were inevitable. Identifying 
the factors that influence student performance will greatly assist private and public educational institutions in 
analyzing and improving the existing systems they use in implementing Outcome-Based Education for engineering 
students. Moreover, the results of the study will not only help the engineering departments but may also serve as a 
basis for other educational programs in improving the systems they use to fully utilize the potential of the students. 
 
1.1 Online Modality  
There has been a rapid shift in the delivery of course instructions from the traditional way to distance learning. In the 
Philippines, it became necessary for most schools to pivot to online classes for learning because of the COVID-19 
pandemic since most areas in the country are under strict quarantine restrictions. This sudden shift has led to shock 
and tension among students and faculty members, whether personally or professionally (Khalaf, 2020). 
 
Different video conferencing applications and learning management systems are being used to transmit smooth 
communication and distribution of learning materials and activities online between teachers and students. This 
called for institutions to adapt and innovate to continue delivering course content amidst crises.  
 
To properly facilitate this type of education, the preparedness of the institution and the motivation for online 
learning of the students must also be taken into consideration to form an understanding between the instructor and 
its students. The communication between the parties involved shall be clear to properly deliver and manifest the goal 
and objective of this learning shift.

897","6. Conclusion  
Since there are abrupt changes in implementing online distance learning to recommence education on newly 
established systems, the study specifically sought to find out the significance of the three latent variables, Individual 
Profile, Learning Resources, and Class Delivery on the OBE Grade of UST Engineering students during the first 
semester when full-time Enriched Virtual Mode of learning was implemented by the institution, which was during 
the first semester of A.Y. 2020-2021.  
 
The researchers sorted the variables based on the formulated survey questionnaire and subsequently constructed a 
Structural Equation Model on the software WarpPLS to simplify and carry out the statistical analysis. After running 
the data, results showed that one independent variable, Individual Profile, was found significant among the three 
Independent Variables. There are six (6) observed variables under Individual Profile which are the following: 
Learning Style, Community, and Social Connection, Geographical Location, Self-motivation, Learning 
Environment, and Financial Capability.  
 
Considering the aim of the study to aid engineering students regarding their distance learning practices and 
techniques, the results from statistical analysis displayed satisfactory and specific outcomes. It allows the 
educational sector, including students, teachers, and academic institutions, to focus on students' Individual Profiles 
in creating new and improved learning approaches for the betterment of the whole educational system after being 
affected by one of the most challenging phenomena nationwide, the COVID-19 Pandemic.  
 
Highlighting the technical subjects being undergone in the Engineering course, implementation of various laboratory 
activities became a challenge for the institution to conduct virtually. The Individual Profiles of students are different 
under distance learning and possession of resources is one of the major issues encountered, taking into account that 
these classes would require several tools or machines. Also, with the limited hands-on experience that became 
unavailable for students, ensued a lack of confidence in the following entry to the professional engineering world. 
 
On the other hand, with the convergent validity of all the three latent variables, it can be concluded that despite 
Individual Profile being the only one of significance, all three variables still have a small interrelation. The study 
allows the concerned bodies to tackle the Learning Resources and Class Delivery variables after primary 
comprehension with Individual Profile.

1. Introduction  
Along with the increasing number of car users in Indonesia, the car is now for some people a hobby item that is 
not only a means of transportation that can take its owner from point A to point B but also a life partner who 
makes users happy and most of the car hobbyists will take care of their car. with extras, both from the car 
exterior, car interior, and of course in terms of engine health because without a healthy engine the car cannot 
operate properly as it should. 
 
One of the treatments carried out to maintain or restore engine performance is to do a carbon clean which aims 
to clean the carbon crust produced from the rest of the combustion of fuel in the engine room which can 
interfere with the combustion process that occurs so that it will directly reduce the performance of the car 
engine. carbon clean itself generally uses a special liquid that is inserted into the combustion chamber and in 
general, carbon clean maintenance is carried out periodically every 3000km to 5000km distance. Car engine 
maintenance in general can be done at the official workshop of the Sole Agent Brand Holder (ATPM) for the car 
brand you own, but due to the increasing number of car users, there are not a few third-party workshops that 
offer services that are the same or even more than those offered by official workshops. Like engines in general, 
engines in cars require regular maintenance aimed at maintaining engine performance so that it remains in 
optimal condition without any problems so that the car can operate properly as it should.  
 
The process of carbon clean maintenance services offered by THE WORKSHOP uses the oxyhydrogen carbon 
clean method which is more effective and safe for car engines and is the only workshop that applies the 
oxyhydrogen carbon clean method. The oxyhydrogen carbon clean process carried out by THE WORKSHOP 
can still be optimized again to reduce the length of service time for oxyhydrogen carbon clean services by using 
the Business Process Reengineering (BPR) method. (Goksoy et al., 2012) explained that BPR is a strategic 
method for organizational change. This is very important considering that companies want to survive in today's 
competitive environment. Every company almost every year or every five years needs change. This change was 
made so that the company was able to adapt to the times. If this is not done, the company will not be able to

Abstract 
 
The current COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the lifestyle of people from education, business, and even the 
healthcare service. There is a rise in telemedicine utilization among different countries. Third-world countries such 
as the Philippines have been seen to consider telemedicine, however not as widely applied. The aim of this study 
was to determine the factors affecting the acceptance and behavioral perception of Filipinos on the adoption and 
usage of telemedicine in the Philippines. A total of 533 Filipinos answered an online survey that was collected 
through different social media platforms. Using multiple linear regression, factors under the unified theory of 
acceptance and use of technology, personal factors, individual factors, and political and environmental factors were 
considered. With a 96.53% R-square value, the results posit that age, geographic location, data privacy issues, 
resistance to use, usage behavior, intention to use, effort and performance expectancy, and hedonic motivation were 
the key factors affecting perceived user adoption. The employment status modeled the regression equation 
considered in this study. The findings of this study would be advantageous for developing strategies to increase the 
adoption among Filipinos for telemedicine. The healthcare system in the Philippines may adopt the findings of this 
study to increase Filipino trust and usage behavior. Lastly, the results and latent of this study could be utilized by 
other developing countries who want to increase adoption and usage of telemedicine, even evaluate technology 
usage worldwide.

1. Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted the way people are living. One of the changes in the education system 
(Prasetyo et al., 2021), lifestyle, and business (Ong et al., 2021a) include the shifting from face-to-face meetings to 
online meetings for safety purposes. Everything nowadays has become dependent on the utilization of technology. 
To which, even the healthcare system in different countries was seen to adopt the new normal. The consideration of 
using telemedicine (a remote diagnosis and treatment using technology) was seen to be evident that developed 
countries are trying to amplify and integrate specifications for its special use (Albahri et al., 2021). However, 
developing countries are still hesitant with its utilization that further development and emphasis on its utilization 
may leave the citizen outdated. One of the developing countries that has yet to fully adopt telemedicine is the 
Philippines. 
 
In the Philippines, a large absence in the healthcare system has been observed due to the challenges perceived from 
and by the government when it comes to implementation (World Health Organization, 2018). Some factors affecting

government officials and entrepreneurs to highlight a user-friendly telemedicine application and let people 
understand and know the benefits. This will entail more Filipinos to use and adapt with the development in the 
healthcare system available.  
 
6. Conclusion 
With the continuous rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is advisable to consider mitigation by staying at home to 
reduce risk exposure among people. With the consideration of health-related impacts, people perceived going to 
hospitals as a challenge due to the lockdown. Recent development in technology has led different countries to 
consider using telemedicine – an offsite, online, remote way to consult with health-related issues with professionals. 
This study considered factors such as environmental and political, personal, individual factors, and the UTAUT2 
model. Employing a step-wise MLR analysis from a 533 dataset, it was seen that PE, EE, IU, GL, and HM showed a 
direct and high significance to PUA. Moreover, GL and RU were seen to have low significance in relation to PUA. 
Lastly, age was seen to have an indirect proportion to PUA. When people see the benefit, contribution, 
understanding, and purpose of telemedicine, they would have the perception to adapt with the technology. With that, 
the habit of using telemedicine may be developed and people would eventually consider telemedicine as a new 
normal with regards to consultation with different healthcare services.

Hypothesis Test 
Simple linear regression analysis is an analytical tool used to measure the influence between the independent 
variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) (Sugiyono, 2011). Based on the results of descriptive analysis, the 
overall purchase intention  variable is in the Good category. This is indicated by the overall value obtained by the 
purchase intention  varable of 83.9%. This means that  Shopee e-commerce has implemented all four dimensions 
of the purchase intention variable with enough baik that can attract users to provide product recommendations to  
others, share If you have made a purchase, and are interested in finding more complete information about the 
product of interest Based on the results of descriptive analysis, variabel consumer trust as a whole is in the good 
category. This is indicated by the overall value obtained by the consumer trust  variable of 76.6%. This means 
that consumer trust variables  have carried out both dimensions  quite well  by  building trusting beliefs and 
trusting intentions to consumers such as providing good service for consumers so as to trigger consumers to 
accept the risks that may occur in making online purchases. , willing to provide information subjectively, as well 
as take advice from e-commerce seller Shopee. 
 
6. Conclusion  
1. 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis, the social commerce construct variable  in Shopee  e-
commerce in Indonesia as a whole is in the good category with a value of 80.2%. This shows that  Shopee 
e-commerce has been good in building social commerce constructs. 
2. 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis, the variable consumer trust in  Shopee e-commerce in 
Indonesia as a whole is in the good category with a value of 76.65%. this shows that shopee e-commerce 
builds consumer trust well. 
3. 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis, the purchase intention  variable in  Shopee e-commerce in 
Indonesia as a whole is in the good category even almost very good with a value of 83.9% This shows that  
Shopee e-commerce has built a good purchase intention. 
4. 
The results showed that the Social Commerce Construct variable  had a significant effect on the Consumer 
Trust variable. This can be seen from the social commerce construct variable path coefficient value  of 
0.724 with a probability number of 0.000 indicating that this number is less than alpha (p<0.05), so it is 
said to be significant. Overall, the average total social commerce construct variable score score  is 
otherwise good. This suggests that the recommendation indicators at Shopee can reliably drive the rise of 
Consumer Trust. 
5. 
The results showed that the Social Commerce Construct variable  had a significant effect on the Purchase 
Intention variable. This can be seen from the coefficient value of the Social Commerce Construct  variable 
path with Purchase Intention of 0.429 with a probability number of 0.000 indicating that this number is 
less than alpha (p<0.05), so it is said to be significant. This suggests that indicators of consumer buying 
interest in Shopee may drive increased Purchase Intentions.

Abstract 
 
The Indonesian government in 2020 implemented the Independent Learning-Independent Campus (MBKM) policy, 
namely the Independent Learning-Independent Campus Policy where students are allowed to study for 3 semesters 
outside their study program. Lecturers play an important role in the implementation of MBKM policies. Therefore, it 
is important to know the factors that influence lecturer satisfaction in the implementation of MBKM. These factors 
are part of the soft Total Quality Management (TQM) concept which is responsible for lecturer satisfaction. This 
research takes a case study at the Indonesian Institute of Technology (ITI). The purpose of this study was to 
determine the effect of soft TQM practices on lecturer satisfaction in implementing MBKM policies. The soft TQM 
aspects studied are: (1) top management commitment; (2) team work; (3) lecturer empowerment; (4) training; and 
(5) culture. Respondents as many as 70 lecturers where only 58 valid questionnaires. Multiple regression method 
was used to examine the relationship between all aspects of soft TQM and lecturer satisfaction. The results showed 
that the variables that leveraged the satisfaction of lecturers in implementing MBKM were lecturer empowerment, 
top management commitment and teamwork. But cultural factors and training are not leverage for lecturer 
satisfaction. The results also show that top management commitment, teamwork, lecturer empowerment, training 
and culture simultaneously have no effect on lecturer satisfaction.

1. Introduction 
Creativity and innovation are essential to ensure sustainable human development. As competition get fiercer, 
universities should prepare the students who are currently studying in higher education to become real learners who 
are skilled, flexible and tenacious (agile learners). The Indonesian government in 2020 implemented the 
Independent Learning Policy - Independent Campus (MBKM). This policy aims to prepare students to become 
strong scholars, relevant to the needs of the times. Students are allowed to study for 3 semesters outside their study 
program (Direktorat Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, 2020). Through 
MDKM, students have opportunities to enrich their insight and competence because learning can take place, not 
only in campus but also everywhere outside campus. This paradigm change certainly has an impact on the 
management practices of education in universities. In order to succeed the of the policy, various important factors 
should be considered, including: how the top managenent committed to support the implementation of the policy, 
synergy of internal and external teamwork, empowerment of lecturers in implementing the policy, the need for 
training to understand the policy, and cultural changes in the teaching and learning process. These factors are part of 
the soft TQM concept.  
 
TQM is very important in order to lead to competitive advantage (Amin et al. 2017). Colleges are complex 
organizations that operate in a dynamic, diverse and ever-changing environment with shifting values (Bess and Jay, 
2008). That is why TQM is also necessary and has been applied in universities. TQM has an increasingly important 
role in the global market, because TQM has an important aspect to create job satisfaction. The objective of TQM is 
customer satisfaction through employee satisfaction (Bari et al. 2016). 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

IEOM Society International
938","line with the views of Alsughayir (2014) which states that there is a strong relationship between organizations that 
adopt TQM practices and the job satisfaction of their employees. The results of this study also do not provide 
support for the statement that soft TQM contributes positively to employee job satisfaction, which is one of the main 
goals of any quality management system (Dubey et al. 2018). 
 
The other thing learned from this research is to see relationship between every aspect of soft TQM with lecturer 
satisfaction. The finding of the soft TQM aspect of top management commitment shows a significant relationship 
with lecturer satisfaction. Lecturers at ITI consider the activities of top management commitment in MBKM as an 
important factor to determine their satisfaction. If the organization wants to increase success, then there is no choice 
for leaders but to have commitment, because the reciprocal relationship between leadership commitment and 
employee satisfaction with TQM programs is usually very close and linear (Soltani et al., 2005). This is also 
supported by empirical research from Karia and Asaari (2006) and Addis et al. (2019) which show a positive 
relationship between top management commitment and employee job satisfaction. 
 
With regard to lecturer empowerment, it shows a significant positive relationship with lecturer satisfaction. This 
shows that ITI lecturers consider managerial practices have to support them to be involved in the organization, 
because they need substantial autonomy and responsibility; develop new ways of learning, are briefed on MBKM, 
and are rewarded. The analysis also reveals that the soft TQM aspect of lecturer empowerment has a high beta 
coefficient compared to other aspects of soft TQM. Thus, employee empowerment is the soft TQM element that 
most determines lecturer satisfaction. This finding is in line with Gimenez et al. (2015) which concludes that the 
TQM philosophy to give autonomy to employees and let employees control the quality of their work and make 
improvements when needed, will contribute to increase job satisfaction. This finding is in line with previous 
findings which concluded that there was a significant positive impact of employee empowerment on job satisfaction 
(Addis et al.,2019) and (Laseinde et al.,2019).  
 
The research findings indicate that the training variable does not have a significant relationship with lecturer job 
satisfaction. Lecturers experience managerial practices that encourage them to participate in training and education 
programs; scheduled training, wide open training opportunities are not useful to increase their satisfaction. This is in 
line with the findings of Batista et al. (2013), Chang et al. (2010), who stated that training has a negative effect on 
employee job satisfaction. However, this is not in line with Jung's findings which state that an increase in knowledge 
and capacity in acquiring skills indicates a higher level of job satisfaction. 
 
The research findings indicate that the culture variable does not have a significant relationship with lecturer job 
satisfaction. This is not in line with the findings of Theresia et al. (2018) which states that culture has a positive 
effect on lecturer job satisfaction. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study describes the relationship between aspects of soft TQM and job satisfaction in the context of changing 
MBKM policies in Indonesia. This study aims to close the gap of limited research on the influence of soft TQM 
aspects on lecturer satisfaction, especially when a new policy is implemented in Indonesia. The main conclusions 
that can be drawn from the results of this study can be stated as follows: 
 
1. The research findings show that top management commitment, lecturer empowerment, training, team work, 
culture simultaneously have no positive effect on lecturer satisfaction. Thus, the five soft aspects of TQM 
simultaneously did not affect the level of lecturer satisfaction in the MBKM era. 
2. The most important aspects of soft TQM to determine the satisfaction of lecturers in the MBKM era are the 
commitment of top management, empowerment of lecturers and team work. 
3. The interesting thing in the findings of this study is that training and culture do not have a significant 
relationship with lecturer satisfaction in the MBKM era. 
4. The findings contribute to educational organizations in Indonesia to create an understanding of the 
application of soft TQM aspects that result in increased teacher satisfaction in the MBKM era. However, 
this study has some limitations. First, the research design is cross sectional, where the questionnaires are 
collected at a certain time. In fact, lecturers' perceptions of the implementation of soft TQM aspects of the 
MBKM era can change over time. Second, this research is only a case study in a private university. Third,

Abstract 
 
The challenge of meeting administrative demands has always been the goal of leaders worldwide because workforce 
management is a critical factor in boosting the efficiency of business organizations. In the context of a diverse labor 
workforce, such as the labor composition present in the Philippines, wherein generational and cultural differences 
shape people, different leadership styles are considered to determine the optimal approach that can benefit the 
organization. This study aims to identify statistically significant factors affecting management leadership among 
Filipinos in the Philippines utilizing multiple regression analysis using the Minitab 19 Statistical software. The study 
gathered several participants that voluntarily participated in the self-administered questionnaire online. Furthermore, 
the researchers utilized convenience sampling to gather participants given the current situation due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Results shows factors such Served as an officer in the organization (p-value = 0.000), Motivation (p-
value = 0.024), Organizational culture (p-value = 0.031), Attitude towards the behavior (p-value = 0.004), Social 
norms (p-value = 0.000), and Adapted behavior (p-value = 0.000) were determined to be significant variables 
affecting the management leadership among Filipinos in the Philippines. The researchers have provided a robust 
model and findings that can be utilized to establish optimum leadership management. Ultimately creating a study 
that can be used to a greater extent to utilize the methods of other countries.

1. Introduction  
The organization and governance of human resources are considered a vital component in developing the 
development of any business institution around the globe; given the implications that there is a recurring dilemma in 
establishing an appropriate workforce to satisfy the needs of the business institution (Hota & Gosh 2013; Calabrese 
et al. 2013). IPS News (2020) determined that management leadership and workforce development are expected to 
increase by at least 8.49% per annum over years 2020-2026. This implies that the increasing insistence 
accompanying it on operational capabilities, workforce analytics, and lowered labor expenses are being heavily 
appraised in these modern times (IPS News 2020). Modern industries consider management leadership to have a 
successful and effective growth factor for a business as Safrankova et al. (2020) stated that industry leaders must 
consider vital components such as self-actualization, professional growth, a suitable work atmosphere, competitive 
pay, excellent employee perks, and professional management to achieve employee satisfaction. 
 
The previously mentioned management leadership is necessary for the dawn of Industry 4.0, given the labor-focused 
and export-based growth nature of members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, and 
is known as the place for companies with a worldwide influence. This is evident from the GDP performance of the 
ASEAN economy, consistently dominating with a GDP value of 5% compared to the average of the global economy

Based on the spearman correlation results, the researchers identified the correlation coefficient to indicate the 
connection between an independent and dependent variable. Factors such as Social norms and Adapted behavior 
showed a very strong positive correlation with perceived leadership effectiveness. Thus, Motivation, Interpersonal 
skills, Work values, and Intention to follow presented a strong positive correlation with the dependent variable. 
Moreover, factors such as Multigenerational cohort, Organizational culture, Perceived behavioral control, and 
Attitude toward behavior exhibited a moderate positive correlation with the dependent variable. Additionally, the 
Number of children presented a weak positive correlation to the dependent variable. Lastly, the Highest educational 
attainment, Employment status, and Regional location of organization exhibited a very weak positive correlation 
over Filipinos’ perceived leadership effectiveness. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research is studied to identify the statistically significant factors that influence management leadership among 
Filipinos in the Philippines. Several variables were examined in the study, including the individual factors and 
theories such as Generational Cohort Theory (GCT) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB).  Moreover, the 
variables were evaluated using multiple regression analysis. 
  
Results indicated that Served as an officer in the organization, Motivation, Organizational culture, Attitude towards 
the behavior, Social norms, and Adapted behavior were statistically significant in influencing management 
leadership among Filipinos in the Philippines with 97.68% model fitness. People's individual factors and behavior 
contribute to the perceived effectiveness of management leadership among Filipinos. Furthermore, limitations were 
identified; the study or model can be used to a greater extent to utilize the styles and methods of other countries.

Abstract 
 
According to a study on the Philippine Manufacturing Activities by the Board of Investments (BOI) in 2017, the 
Philippines is regarded as Asia’s new manufacturing powerhouse; its top 1,000 corporations include 322 
manufacturing firms and post gross revenues totaling Php 3.2 trillion. The manufacturing industry is a significant 
player in the economic sectors, generating both wealth and employment. However, many processes experience 
significant delays due to machine downtimes and erratic work schedules, resulting in low machine efficiency and 
product throughput. Through careful consideration, this research study focuses on a 3rd party logistics company 
specifically, the B-Mirk Enterprises. B-Mirk Enterprises is one of the premier providers of manufacturing, 
warehousing, logistics, and manpower services in the Philippines. The research study aims to evaluate the 
company’s performance through the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) criteria and identify parameters that 
influence the outcomes of the company’s production processes. The research study focuses on the company’s newly 
implemented services within the labeling department which are also identified as the lowest in terms of its 
efficiency. A mathematical model is generated through the use of the Linear Programming technique, which is an 
analytical method of problem-solving and decision-making that is proven to be useful in the management of 
organizations. The overall study evaluated the company’s overall production performance as a support in developing 
an LP algorithm which made use of LINGO Optimizing Software and Excel Solver and was able to maximize 
machine efficiency and uptime for 7 hours or 2.3 hours per shift for B-Mirk’s Labeling Department.

6. Conclusion  
The study was conducted to further assess the production downtime of B-Mirk's labeling machine. The labeling 
production from a third-party logistics such as B-Mirk Corporation became the focus of this research through the 
motivation of a new production process emerging amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the specific hurdles that 
needed to be addressed. These hurdles influenced the need to provide greater improvements in terms of productivity 
in overall labeling production. The production reports provided by the company were analyzed, and Overall 
equipment effectiveness (OEE) was utilized to perform an in depth assessment of the machine performance, which 
revealed that the downtime is a critical factor in the machine's availability and performance rate, which affects the 
production output. As seen in Table 5, the availability and performance rate was one of the causes which affected 
the overall OEE score of 1.12%, which indicates that having a considerable duration of downtime corresponds to a 
decrease in the actual production time. In manufacturing, actual production time is the overall duration that the 
machine is working, which therefore also affects the machine's performance, resulting in a decrease in the 
production output for the said shift. This decrease in the actual production time was also influenced by the 1-hour 
maintenance, given that a considerable amount of downtime occurred for the said shift. This study proved that it is 
possible to reduce downtime through evaluation of production time and output, and allows the focus of improvement 
on specified characterized downtime that had a major contribution to the decreased machine efficiency. The 
optimization model was also solved with the use of the software tools such as LINGO and Excel solver, which 
exhibited a maximized uptime for a single shift for each of the SKUs. From the optimized values obtained from the 
LP model, uptime was maximized by 7.0256 hours for the three consecutive shifts representing each SKU. This 
constitutes an uptime of 2.3419 for each shift. Results obtained from the excel solver indicate as well that classified 
downtime, D1, and D4 could still be further optimized through the company's focus on improving efforts in having a 
fixed time for Preparation, Set-up, and Cleaning Area, respectively.

Abstract 
 
The inadequacy of sustainable energy is endlessly posing major challenges globally. The issue of energy 
optimisation is indispensable for manufacturing sector, particularly for a hot-dip galvanising process where 
galvanising furnaces are the significant energy users. This study is aimed at comparative analysis of specific energy 
consumption and energy consumption benchmarking in four galvanising plants with the view to necessitate the 
identification of best practices. Energy baselines were used as quantitative reference points to compare energy 
performance indicators and quantify fluctuations in energy performance during the baseline and reporting periods. A 
quantitative analysis was also conducted to benchmark four galvanising facilities on factors that included the 
electricity/zinc ratio, electricity /dips ratio and product tonnage/zinc used ratio. The results revealed improved 
performance for plant 4 over time relative to the baseline consumption when compared to plants 1, 2 and 3. Plant 4 
also outperformed other facilities after the energy efficiency interventions in terms of electricity/zinc ratio and 
electricity/ product tonnage ratio. Given the disparity between the results of specific energy consumption (SEC) for 
the four plants, it was concluded that SEC alone should not be used as an energy performance indicator.

1. Introduction  
Manufacturing plants are currently regarded as significant contributors to overall carbon gas emissions due to high-
energy usage (Sibanda and Ndlela, 2020). By definition, the carbon footprint is a measure of the environmental 
impact of human lifestyles and processes (Pandey, Agrawal and Pandey, 2011). Quantitatively, it is a metric 
measurement indicative of the amount of carbon dioxide and other gases that are emitted to the environment. The 
accumulative effect of carbon dioxide results in the “greenhouse effect”, which is the capacity of all these gases to 
heat insulate the earth’s surface thus resulting in the latter’s temperatures gradually rising (Kweku et al., 2017). It is 
noted that promoting energy efficiencies in manufacturing industries will generally reduce both the carbon footprint 
as well as operational costs. Hot-dip galvanising is a process of coating steel products through immersion into a bath 
of molten zinc (Bordignon and Eynde, 2007). When considering components and fabrications that should be used 
with zero or minimum maintenance for extended periods, hot-dip galvanising becomes an adequate cost-effective 
protection system (Hornsby, 1995). The issue of energy optimisation is indispensable for manufacturing sector, 
particularly for a hot-dip galvanising process. Galvanising steel or iron is the product for about half of the zinc 
produced worldwide (Blake and Beck, 2004). The cited galvanising sector was found to be devoid of methodologies 
for the establishment and documentation of energy baselines for improving their energy performance for hot-dip 
galvanising process, which adversely impinges on tractability in the analysis of energy consumption. The outlying 
challenge faced in computing the energy consumption benchmark for the galvanising plants lied in the fact that even 
plants that are processing the same raw materials have variable equipment sizes and throughputs. Hence, the aim of 
the study was to develop energy performance indicators for galvanising plants. 
 
2. Literature Review 
It is vital to comprehend that energy performance indicators are critical for provision of the pertinent information on 
energy performance, which is a key enabler for development of energy-saving initiatives by a galvaniser. This 
section focuses on the literature survey on energy consumption baselines, energy performance indicators, specific 
energy consumption, and energy consumption benchmarking.

and organisational shutdown policies during the festive season. 
 
5. Discussion  
Energy is consumed during the galvanising even when the process is idling where no parts are produced since it is 
imperative that the zinc is kept in a molten state. Therefore, the SEC depends on the production rate of the 
galvaniser and thus, SEC is not constant. Previous work by Blake and Beck (2004) had also revealed the production-
dependent nature of SEC, outlining that at low levels of production, the energy losses from the walls and surface of 
the furnace during the galvanising process become more influential. The evidence from work measurement revealed 
that the exposed surface of molten zinc spent more time without insulative covers when compared to the time which 
the furnace expended in production.  
There was generally no substantial amount of zinc used between the baseline and reporting period, hence the 
scenario of Plant 1 indicates a poor level of control and hence greater potential for energy savings. On the other 
hand, for Plant 2, it was revealed that as the level of production increased the SEC generally decreased. The level of 
production during the reporting period was found to be higher than the production level during the baseline period, 
while on the other hand, SEC decreased during the reporting period for Plant 3. On the other hand, for Plant 4, the 
level of production during the reporting period was found to be lower than the production level during the baseline 
period, and the SEC also decreased during the reporting period. Hence, given the disparity between the results of 
SEC for the four plants, it was noted that SEC alone cannot be used as an EnPC since it is not influenced by 
production only but affected by other variables such as material handling efficiency.  
The essence of energy consumption benchmarking was to increase general awareness of energy efficiency among 
the galvanisers which in turn may influence a behaviour change provides objective, reliable information on energy 
use and the benefits of improvements. A box and whiskers plot for electricity/zinc ratios for the four plants before 
energy efficiency interventions indicated that there is likely to be a difference between Plant 1 and Plant 2. 
Significant differences were also noted between Plant 2 and Plant 3. However, no significant differences were noted 
between Plant 3 and Plant 4. 
A box and whiskers plot for electricity/dips ratios for the four plants before energy efficiency interventions indicated 
that there is likely to be a difference between Plant 1 and Plant 2. Significant differences were also noted between 
Plant 2 and Plant 3 and between Plant 3 and Plant 4. A box and whiskers plot for electricity/product tonnage ratios 
(kWh/tonne) for the four plants before energy efficiency interventions revealed a difference between Plant 1 and 
Plant 2. Significant differences were also noted between Plant 2 and Plant 3 and between Plant 3 and Plant 4. 
 
6. Conclusion   
Bottom-up energy efficiency and saving calculations can be used to derive the energy savings that could be achieved 
by the galvaniser after the implementation of energy efficiency measures. Best practices were identified in Plant 4; 
covering of process tanks with insulating material prevented heat loss and led to improved energy performance.  It 
was concluded that SEC alone should not be used as an energy performance indicator since it is not influenced by 
production only but affected by other variables such as material handling efficiency. Energy consumption 
benchmarking can be focused on poorly performing Plant 4 and necessitates the identification of best practices from 
Plant 4 that can be replicated across other Plants 1, 2 and 3.

Abstract 
 
Business has increasingly become more competitive impacted by the development of information technology. The 
buying and selling process has now expanded to online platforms with the help of the internet. This shift 
significantly makes e-commerce growth even faster. Due to COVID-19, there is some decrease in sales at offline 
stores, therefore, e-commerce has the opportunity to continue to grow. But many customers in Indonesia still choose 
to shop offline for groceries item and only 59% have already tried to shop through e-commerce. The reasons for this 
include delivery time, shipping prices, quality concerns, unreachable delivery areas, and complicated systems. This 
paper highlights the importance of e-commerce service quality that reflects on customer satisfaction using NPS (Net 
Promotor Score). A case study is implemented on an e-commerce fresh product company. Quality criteria were first 
determined through questionnaires by four experts. There are 14 accepted criteria used for NPS questionnaires to 
customers as an assessment of the service quality. The NPS score collected from 237 respondents resulting in 6 
criteria below the average of the company’s score. From these findings, the company can further develop and 
prioritized said criteria for improving e-commerce fresh product service quality.

1. Introduction 
Electronic commerce is a term that describes the process done by electronic methods to do commercial activities 
(Qin et al. 2014). According to Turban et al. (2017), e-commerce activities include buying, selling, transporting, or 
trading data, goods, or services. Nowadays, e-commerce has been common ground in Indonesia. The growth in the 
value of electronic commerce (e-commerce) in Indonesia reached 78%, occupying the highest position in the world 
(Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information 2021).  
 
One of the most important scopes of e-commerce is retail. Not only because groceries with staple goods such as 
fresh fruits, vegetables, red meat, and seafood products are the life support for the community because it needs to be 
fulfilled daily with great concern for time, quality, and quantity. In Indonesia, offline retail for fresh products has 
experienced decreased income of up to 26% from 2020 to 2021. With the decrease in offline shopping due to 
COVID-19, e-commerce can be the solution for fulfilling grocery needs.  
 
According to a survey conducted by Snapcart (2020) on Online Shopping Habits for Groceries, 59% of shoppers in 
Indonesia have used e-commerce platforms to shop for their grocery needs. Based on the survey, the reasons 
customers do not use e-commerce because they want to see products in person, uncertain delivery times, expensive 
shipping prices, concerns about freshness and cleanliness, no payment options on the spot, difficulty to get the 
needed goods, the delivery area is not reached, the system is complicated, and the price is more expensive. 
 
For those reasons above, e-commerce companies, especially those that sell fresh product needs to give great service 
and product quality to their customers to be able to achieve competitiveness. Slack et al. (2013) stated that quality is 
consistent in conformity with customer expectations, in which customer expectations and perceptions are influenced 
by several factors, some of which cannot be controlled by operations and some of which, to some extent, can be 
managed. According to Sun (2021), service quality is positively related to customer satisfaction and depends on

39% Net Promotor Score. Research for NPS in e-commerce fresh products has not been conducted, so the 
benchmark can be seen from offline groceries and e-commerce shops in Indonesia ranging from 5 to 34%. This 
shows that Company X has great positioning and opportunities in the grocery and e-commerce industry. 
 
The company itself has several criteria that are below the average score. They are product price, product availability, 
and customer benefit program. Since groceries and fresh product has fluctuated in prices, customers tend to look for 
the best price. Also, customers expect that in an app, the availability of the product displayed is always available, 
and lastly customer benefit program is something that can’t be underestimated because this is what grows loyalty in 
customers. In Indonesia, there is already so many e-commerce fresh product company. Therefore, Company X can 
focus on improving said criteria that have a lower score to be able to grab more attention of customers.

Abstract 
 
As the internet users in the Philippines have become increasingly rampant, Tagalog Sentiment Analysis is essential 
when determining general sentiments correlated to a topic. Among Tagalog tweets, backward slang has gained 
increased popularity on social media. Deep learning algorithms such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and 
Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) have been proven more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms. This 
study explored and evaluated the effects of backward slang on two deep learning models using performance metrics 
for classification models. Results show that backward slang helps in the expressivity of textual data, given the 
improvement in overall sentiment scores.

1. Introduction 
The Tagalog dialect is one of the most spoken language forms in the Philippines, wherein it can be used for 
communication among people orally or virtually. This dialect is also known to have specific jargons or slang that 
some people would use as a substitute for particular words that would possess the same meaning yet have different 
word structures or pronunciations. This chapter provides an overview of the research conducted, including general 
background and general motivation. Key points such as Sentiment Analysis are defined into specific ideas applied in 
the latter parts of the study.  
 
1.1 Background of the Study 
The Philippines is one of the most significant internet users as it is very rampant in the country to use technology for 
everyday use. As years pass in the Philippines, the population of internet users is increasing, primarily due to the 
pandemic's current situation, which requires the majority of the people to use these platforms to their advantage. 
Recently, the demand for Internet usage on jobs and education has increased the number of people using the Internet 
and its properties. The population of internet users (Datareportal, 2020) peaked at 73.91 million in January 2021, 
increasing by 4.2 million from 2020-to 2021. 
 
As the English language forms quickly change over time, digital technology and its development allow the 
Philippine slang to create newer terms further and spread quickly, passing from Millennials to future digital natives 
(Danao et al 2017). With the increase of development on the Internet, information grows exponentially. For 
organizations and enterprises, extracting valuable information from consumers is very important. Social media 
platforms such as Facebook and YouTube collect vast amounts of user reviews that form a rich source of 
information for companies to understand their customers (Moudjari et al, 2020). The information provided through 
user reviews is used to classify sentiments essential to the decision-making process of enterprises and organizations 
(Li et al 2017).  Li et al, 2017 explored how Chinese text processing affects sentiment analysis results. There are 
many differences between Chinese and English text pre-processing, such as Chinese needs to segment, while 
English does not need to. A total of eight kinds of pre-processing techniques were used: removing URLs, removing 
the numbers, removing the punctuations, removing the stop words, replacing the network words, reverting the

4.9 Bidirectional LSTM 
After computing performance metrics on Bi-LSTM, Table 8 shows the performance metrics on validated models of 
Bi-LSTM with and without Backward Slang. One notable difference is the values of metrics in Bi-LSTM contrary to 
LSTM, as shown in Table 7. It is shown that Bi-LSTM obtained better performance compared to models developed 
using LSTM, most notably, on recall score. The same can be said from what was that classification accuracy, and 
F1-score are both important when looking at the performance metrics of a model. Upon investigation on the values 
in Table 8, the difference between classification accuracy and AUC on both versions of Bi-LSTM has accumulated 
to 3.45% difference while F1-Score obtained 3.56% difference between models. A lower value in difference 
between the two models regarding Accuracy and F1-score could mean that Bi-LSTM has played a role in 
minimizing the misclassification of labeled tweets.

6. Conclusion  
This study conducted a series of experiments wherein the Backward Slang was included on tweets as a feature to 
classify sentiment polarities. The models developed in this study do not use any feature engineering to extract 
special features or any complex modules like sentiment treebanks. Every version of models in this study only relies 
on pre-trained word vector representation. The study used LSTM and Bi-LSTM as these deep learning architectures 
can extract further contextual information from dealing with forward and backward dependencies from feature 
sequences. Despite the complexity of Filipino tweets, especially in the domain of politics due to the presence of 
sarcastic and satire tweets, the models developed can classify their respective sentiment polarities, having good to 
great performance metrics. It is conclusive that the inclusion of Backward Slang helps improve overall sentiment 
scores and performance metrics. While Backward Slang can be used to express negative or positive opinions on a 
tweet, the presence of these features on tweets has appeared to improve the expressivity of negative opinions more 
than positive opinions on sentiment analysis. 
 
For future studies, the inclusion of another domain aside from politics when mining tweets is encouraged to be 
explored as the study is limited to identifying political tweets wherein the presence of sarcastic and satire tweets 
may often occur in the corpus.

Abstract  
 
Waste management is a challenge, especially in developing countries. The rapid economic and population growth 
has further exacerbated the consumption rate, the main driver behind massive waste generation. Recent studies have 
indicated that residents in urban areas generate waste that is roughly 1.2 kg per person, which is an estimated 1.3 
million tons per year. Statistically, this is likely to increase by 1.42 kg per person and 2.2 billion tons in 2025. 
Therefore, to counteract the impact and consequences of spiralling waste generation, it is essential to do away with 
unsuitable and flawed means of production and adopt sustainable manufacturing. The emerging concept of 6R- 
based sustainable manufacturing with its technological elements has given light to new ways of production that can 
be adopted to achieve environmental protection and material efficiency. Material efficiency reduces industrial waste 
volumes of virgin raw materials, extraction and consumption, increasing waste segregation, decreasing energy 
demand, reducing extraction and consumption of virgin raw materials, increasing waste segregation, and decreasing 
carbon emissions thereby, reducing the environmental impact of waste generated by the manufacturing industry. 
However, the concept of 6R and material efficiency are poorly researched, with minimal information on their role in 
waste minimisation, especially at manufacturing levels. Waste generation can only be reduced if material 
consumption and material flow are monitored at the early stages of production; this can be done by emphasising 
material efficiency at the industrial level.

1. Introduction  
Waste management continues to be a global challenge, especially in urban areas of the rapidly growing cities in 
developing countries. Rapid industrialisation and urbanisation have changed the nature of produced waste. This calls 
for evaluating and updating the current solid waste management systems to develop better sustainable waste quality, 
quantity, and composition (Manaf, 2009). According to a study conducted by Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata (2012), it 
was estimated that residents in urban areas generated waste that is roughly 1.2 kg per person, which is estimated to 
be 1.3 million tons per year. Statistically, this is likely to increase by 1.42 kg per person and 2.2 billion tons in 2025. 
Several studies have been conducted by scholars such as Mokebe (2018); Nkosi (2014);  Snyman and Vorster (2011) 
and Worku (2014), focusing on waste management within the City of Tshwane, and have all indicated that over the 
years, there has been an increase in waste generation, which is associated with the rapid population growth and 
urbanisation. Waste generation is the subsequent product of manufacturing; any manufacturing process that involves 
input for product creation generates an output and the by-product (Waste). 
 
Manufacturing industries are still using traditional manufacturing flows of making products, where material 
consumption is the only significant phase without careful consideration of ways of introducing used up material into 
a new cycle for continued material flow. Consequently, material efficiency is under-researched (Allwood et al.,

1002","primary data and case studies reviewed in the literature review. Evidence for this study was collected from multiple 
sources, including content analysis of journals, documents, observations, and interviews. This information was 
further triangulated to pick up patterns, similarities and to provide solid information based on existing literature. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Although sustainable development and sustainable manufacturing are developed concepts, putting them into practice 
remains a challenge due to their broad scope, including several factors that need careful evaluation to ensure balance 
within the environmental, economic, political, and social aspects. Given the diverse interests of all involved 
stakeholders, it is essential to ensure balance in the trade-offs by integrating all objectives and observing the 
mandatory policies and procedures (Rosen and Kishawy, 2012). Sentime (2014) also argues that the application of 
policies and legislation has proven inconsistent. The lack of favourable and comprehensive policies hinders the 
possibility of sustainable socio-economic service delivery and cost-effective waste management systems; there are 
fragmented strategies instead of integrated approaches.  
 
There is a need for Tshwane municipalities to integrate material efficiency and the 6R model into their existing 
Integrated waste management plan; this would help address the existing challenges in waste management. The 
emphasis on waste reduction at the production and end-use phase from the two approaches is exactly what the city 
needs to reduce the amount of waste diverted into landfills, mainly because their existing landfills are reaching their 
life span. This paper emphasises prevention and reduction of waste generation, thereby advocating for waste 
segregation at the source for effective recycling and recovery and as a step toward material efficiency. The paper 
highlights the need to develop a shared understanding of material efficiency in manufacturing and links existing 
performance measurements to this shared understanding through material-efficient operations.

Abstract 
 
In the Procurement Process of Goods and Services an effective and efficient process is needed in its implementation, 
to get the ideal process requires a system or process that is integrated with each other, therefore There are many 
companies that have not applied the concept of lean in the process of procuring goods and services because it is too 
focused on maximizing production performance. The aim of this study is to identify and analyze the performance of 
the process of procuring goods and services in the MRO industry using the Lean Service and VSM and DMAIC 
methods. This study shows that there is still waste or Waste in the process of procuring goods and services, i.e. there 
are still activities is manual and not integrated with this technology based on the findings of the number of waiting 
times Current State is 952.78 Minutes with VA time is 405.78 Minutes and Process Cycle Efficiency process is 
43.83%, after repairs have been made by changing work processes and work tools with an online based system, it 
has been improved waiting time by 525.49 minutes and VA time is 280.49 and increased Process Cycle Efficiency 
to 53.37% along with increasing the output of making Purchase Orders to 951.1 a year from the beginning of 762.2. 
From the results of this study, it is recommended that companies apply the concept of lean to the process of 
procuring goods and services and try to use information technology as a tool to carry out procurement activities.

1. Introduction  
At present there are many improvements made to the production line, but not many improvements or evaluations 
have been made to the goods and services procurement line where the procurement of goods and services should 
also play a role in increasing the company's revenue through efficiency,  This study aims to apply the concept of 
lean service to the procurement process of goods and services, during COVID-19 pandemic conditions, savings from 
all lines need to be made, especially the production line, this study shows that in the procurement line there is a gap 
to make improvements that have a significant impact on costs that come out of the company productivity and quality 
of the procurement process. This research was conducted on one of the aircraft MRO industries in Indonesia, where 
previously there was an inability to fulfill procurement requests from an average of 861 requests per year in the 
initial conditions, only 762 procurement per year were able to be achieved. 
 
The objective of the project is to identify waste in the procurement process of Aircraft MRO Company. and provide 
suggestions for improving the process of procurement of goods and services also to increase the Output Purchase 
Order and reduce delays in the process of procurement of goods and services

1012","6. Conclusion 
Using Lean Service along with Value Stream Mapping and DMAIC can identify waste that occurs in the 
procurement process which is the number of shortages of documents in procurement request activities which causes 
a waiting process for procurement fulfillment (waiting), then the document delivery process is still manual, causing 
a high process waiting time (In-efficient transportation movement of information and Paperwork), then the goods 
procurement process and services that are still manual, for example: offline meetings, document verification is 
manual. Causing a large enough waiting time (unnecessary motion), then there are still deficiencies and errors in 
document making (defects) which causes excessive use of paper (inventory) and the lack of training provided to 
employees causes the procurement process to be often hampered due to lack of ability (underutilized employee 
abilities). Companies can optimize the process of procurement of goods and services, by using the lean service 
method the company can increase production results and reduce waste or waste that occurs in the procurement 
process, in the form of optimizing the use of online-based facilities in the document delivery process.

Abstract 
 
There is a varied way for a company to compete in the market, creating an effective supply chain could be the 
choice by building a new way of a partnership with vendors. Eliminating non-added value through the supply chain 
such as lead time uncertainty can be done by implementing Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI). Information 
exchange between roles related to point of sales which cause vendors to have control over the inventory owned by 
retailers is a characteristic of VMI. A large number of actors had a positive impact from VMI, mainly it can control 
the bullwhip effect in the supply chain. With all the benefits derived from this concept, it comes with some risks 
involved. Most people pay more attention to what suppliers faced by implementing this concept instead of what’s on 
the retailer side. Selecting the right vendor to implement this concept by knowing the risk have to be a concern since 
retailer needs to rely on the vendor’s decision of their inventory. The objective of this research is to identify the risks 
faced by retailers and design the appropriate vendor selection model to apply the concept of VMI. Integrating 
method for identifying the risk (FMEA) and a method for solving multi-criteria decision making (FAHP) is believed 
to be able to obtain a robust result and reduce bias by considering the combination of assessment. Collecting data at 
retail company that already applied the concept of VMI was carried out as a case study in this study.

1. Introduction 
The smooth flow of material and information in the operating system from upstream to downstream is one of the 
necessary things in the supply chain. Choosing the wrong supplier to support operational activity could impact the 
service level of the whole process. This role encourages companies to take various ways to selecting reliable 
vendors and establish good relationships with vendors or suppliers. This strategy is one way to produce a 
competitive advantage in the market.  
 
The term lean in the supply chain has become popular since the introduction of the Toyota Production System, 
continuously to be developed and applied in various fields including supplier selection management. The 
implementation of the lean concept in supplier selection is related to Just in Time where suppliers can provide the 
right product at the right time (Wu, 2003). Based on this concept, it can be seen that the supplier's ability is needed 
in responding to changes in meeting customer demands, and determining supplier selection strategies is the key. 
Kumar et al. also said that the reliability of several suppliers in supplying the business can keep operational activities 
lean (Kumar, Routroy, & Mishra, 2018).  
 
Lots of companies have been implemented Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) to create a productive supply chain. 
In 2015 in a survey conducted by E2Open of 1,000 companies, 70% of them have implemented VMI (Yalcin, 
Özpolat, & Schniederjans, 2018). With VMI retailers give their trust to suppliers so that they have the power to 
manage their product inventory at retailers (Zachariassen, Haas, & Bürkland , 2014). According to Waller et al., this 
system brings various advantages such as the productivity of the sales space, increased sales for retailers, as well as 
providing goods control over the bullwhip effect (Zachariassen, Haas, & Bürkland , 2014). Retailers and 
manufacturers also obtain a benefit when there is a raise in holding costs (Ru, Ruixia, & Zhang, 2017). Neutral 
profit gain between suppliers and retailers can be achieved with incentives in the form of profit or loss sharing as has

The results based on the calculation of the criteria's weight show that the display is the most important thing that 
needs to be considered compared to other criteria. This thing happened because the appearance of the product is the 
thing that greatly affects the productivity of sales in the store. Besides, the appearance of the product is also 
something that greatly influences customer interest to buy a product. the more variants or product options offered, 
the greater opportunity for customers to buy products in large quantities. After the display, the second place as a 
criterion that should be considered is delivery. the system of implementing VMI is the handover of all inventory 
decisions to suppliers, so retailers cannot monitor deliveries made by suppliers. This causes retailers to rely heavily 
on the level of reliability of deliveries made by suppliers. products that are not available can increase the chance of 
lost sales which can be a big loss for retailers. these two criteria are criteria that need to be considered as well as 
possible in the selection of VMI vendors. 
The risk generated from each alternative shown in Table 11 has a significant difference, because there are significant 
differences in risk assessment in almost all criteria. Supplier A has a much lower level of risk than supplier B for 
criteria with a high level of importance such as display and delivery. However, there are conditions that indicate that 
supplier B has a lower level of risk than supplier A, as in the example of the price criteria assessment. Supplier B 
has a low risk on price control because the price offered by the supplier is not too high so that the price can compete 
in the market. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From the comparison of these two suppliers, it can be seen that supplier A is the most decent supplier to apply 
the concept of VMI by conducting the lowest level of risk. In other words, supplier A can be called a reliable 
supplier to manage inventory from retailers. There are some things that need to be developed in this research, such 
as adding more alternatives for comparison from a wider scope. This assessment has different characteristics 
depending on the type of business being run, therefore it would be better if this model could be implemented in other 
fields with a different perspective.

Abstract  
 
The current COVID pandemic saw a surge in the demand for vegetable seeds in the Philippines. Local farmers 
continued to try new vegetable crops using seeds in small packets Seed distributors struggled to keep up with the 
increased demand. This positive market development amidst the uncertain times necessitated the need for an 
improved sales forecasting system for business organizations distributing seed products. This study aimed to 
develop a low fidelity prototype for an in-month seed sales forecasting system. A systems analysis of the current 
process observed in typical seed distribution operations confirmed an opportunity for a computer-based forecasting 
system. During the Systems Design phase, a Hierarchical Input-Process-Output chart, a Use Case Diagram, and Data 
Flow Diagrams were generated. Microsoft Access was used to develop the database. Tables, queries, forms, and 
reports were likewise generated. Low fidelity prototyping was used using Justinmind. Compared to the current 
process, the new system provided several advantages. Flexibility and capability were afforded to a seed distributor, 
in strengthening the forecasting process to cope with the growing demand for vegetable seeds amidst the 
uncertainties brought about by the pandemic.  An exciting opportunity is an application to the development of a 
coexistence system for genetically modified (GM) crop seed production. More importantly, highlighting the tools 
and processes leading up to the development of a simple, low-fidelity prototype provided great academic 
opportunities, particularly in the design of improved agricultural systems,

1. Introduction  
The current pandemic has restricted the movement of food products in the Philippines. Such uncertainties under the 
“New Normal” increased activities at the farm level with a dramatic increase in demand for agricultural inputs. In 
the Philippines, farmers trying new crops or varieties are likely to buy in small packaging units or packets. Business 
organizations engaged in the distribution of vegetable seed products or seed distributors see an opportunity to 
sustain business growth and increase trial usage of vegetable seeds.  
 
The development of a computer-based information system to help strengthen the existing sales forecasting system 
becomes a necessary business tool for seed distributors in the Philippines.  Design ideas for this improved system 
can be tested through rapid prototyping of a user interface. Prototypes can either be high-level or low-level, 
depending on considerations of cost, and accuracy. Despite its importance, not much has been studied in the field of 
product forecasting in agriculture. Adding to this apparent knowledge gap is the fact that there appears to have been 
less study of how design process outputs such as rapid prototypes of concepts (e.g., drawings, scale models) are used 
in implementing novel agricultural system concepts (Klerkx, 2012).

1032","6. Conclusion  
The ongoing pandemic required the availability of an improved seed forecasting system for seed distributors in the 
Philippines. Systems analysis of the typical practices of seed distributors presented opportunities for a computer-
based in-month seed forecasting system. Process maps such as Use Case Diagrams, System Flowcharts, and Data 
Flow facilitated the systems design process. Diagrams helped clarify information flow, users, and data requirements. 
A simulation of databases, forms, queries, and reports using Microsoft Access was very instrumental. As a result, a 
low-fidelity prototype using Justinmind was effectively developed. Compared to the current process, the new system 
provided several advantages. None bigger was the flexibility and capability afforded by the new system to a seed 
distributor, in strengthening the forecasting process to cope with the growing demand for vegetable seeds amidst the 
uncertainties brought about by the pandemic. 
 
Most forecasting methods used in the vegetable seed industry focused on market historical demand, i.e., a reactive 
approach. This prototype provided a more proactive approach. While considering historical demand, the in-month 
feature provides real-time information from the dealer and allows the adjustment of the six-month rolling forecast as 
necessary.   The sales forecasting process is unique for each organization and varies across industries. This proposed 
in-month forecasting system represents an enhancement to existing systems by the incorporation of real-time inputs 
from the Dealer within the current month. The in-month inputs and information captured by the system as provided 
by the Dealer are captured both in the current month’s forecast and in the next month’s forecast. As a result, the 
Sales Manager can incorporate such developments into the six-month rolling forecast as these market developments 
happen. This adds the proactive approach to the current sales forecasting processes observed. 
 
The simple low-fidelity prototype developed for three (3) users in an in-month seed forecasting system present several 
opportunities for the development of other computer-based information systems in the seed industry. Such 
opportunities may include, but are not limited to the following: (a) a Business-to-Business (or B2B) tool to manage 
the relationship between a seed producer and seed distributor, particularly in the areas of forecasting, sales, and credit 
management; and (b) a Business-to-Consumer (or B2C) tool to manage the relationship between a seed distributor 
and a farmer, particularly in the areas of demand planning and other relevant farmer feedback; and (d) a component of 
a coexistence system to sustainably manage the production of GM crops such as Golden Rice and Bt eggplant in the 
Philippines. 
 
The new forecasting system represented by the prototype likewise finds application in industries with operations like 
the seed industry. Equivalent users in similar industries working with crop protection, feeds, animal health, and 
animal nutrition, among others, should find this improved forecasting system useful. Industry. Another exciting 
opportunity is the instructional value available in this study. Highlighted was the process of systems analysis and 
design and the emphasis on the concept of prototyping, as applied to agriculture. The detailed steps involving the 
selected tools represent a simple and effective example of the systems analysis and design process. This can be used 
as instructional material for college-level courses in the systems design and management information systems 
domain. The emphasis on prototyping as a process opens the possible integration of systems design into the academic 
curriculum of the agricultural and bioscience engineering field. Innovation of agricultural systems becomes 
mandatory as the world struggles with a growing population against the backdrop of limited, if not dwindling natural 
resources. The benefits which can be derived from the prototyping process, as part of these innovation projects, can 
certainly help.

Abstract 
 
The study analyzed the procurement process at Company XYZ. It was determined that an existing information 
system is available and in use by the company. However, the RFQ/RFP process is still manually performed. 
Specifically, RFQ/RFPs are prepared outside of the existing system, and then sent to vendors via email. To address 
this gap, a new system was proposed wherein procurement staff and vendors can have a common interface to 
prepare and float RFQ/RFPs (client side), and review and respond to RFQ/RFP (vendor side). This solution is 
expected to reduce PR-to-PO cycle time by 46%.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Company Background 
Company XYZ is a holdings company with more than 10 years of operation in the middle east. It consists of several 
business units under a diversified portfolio – from advertising, events management, and project management 
(Company XYZ, 2021).  
 
Figure 1 shows the high-level structure of the company. A Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is in-charge of the entire 
company, supported by the Internal Audit Team which serves as the check and balance. Under the CEO are the 
divisions, each independent from each other and consists of several business units headed by its own management 
team. As an integrated group of companies, the support functions for all these business units – specifically Human 
Resources (HR), Information Technology (IT), Procurement, Marketing, Legal, and Strategy – are centralized in the 
head office. This allows for economies of scale in terms of workload and resource allocation. 
 
The HR department oversees the end-to-end employee lifecycle, i.e., from recruitment to onboarding, employment 
regularization, retention activities, until separation. This also covers the logistics and legal aspects related to either 
the local transfer of employee sponsorship or bringing in new employees from another country.  
 
Meanwhile, the IT department is responsible for all information system-related facets of the company. It operates 
under a service level agreement (SLA) with the business units and other support functions, prioritizing activities and 
issues based on the SLA. Among these are maintaining the IT infrastructure and ensuring that systems, servers, and 
applications are up and running according to the defined availability, securing periodic back-up of all databases and 
files in shared folders, and developing IT solutions according to the needs of the business units and support 
functions. 
 
For Procurement, the support is transactional in nature and focused on ensuring that the required goods and services 
are delivered on a timely manner, at a reasonable cost, and according to the specifications and criteria set by the 
requesting unit. The department also monitors the spend per business unit, as well as cost savings, and reports these

possible supplier replacements. Both users can review and download the content of the bidding page.

5.3 System Evaluation 
The proposed system was designed to complement the existing information system at Company XYZ. It automates 
the remaining manual process in procurement, i.e., the RFQ/RFP process, and provides a venue for client and 
vendors to communicate seamlessly and reduce the need for separate forms and documents. There is a time limit as 
to when the vendors can bid for RFQ/RFP, therefore cycle time is controlled, and vendors are narrowed down to 
only those seriously interested to participate. 
 
The proposed system will see that processes related to the aforementioned are minimized as queries and POs will 
instantaneously be available to suppliers once approved by the corresponding department and/or purchasing 
manager.  In addition, the previous model engages with a supplier or set of suppliers specifically selected by the 
purchaser. In contrast, the improved model will allow a wider set of suppliers registered in the network to 
immediately gain access to the company’s requests, in the form of queries, bids or orders. 
 
From an average of 5 days spent on the RFQ/RFP process, it is expected to decrease to 3 days. In effect, the PR-to-
PO cycle time will be reduced from 6.5 days to 3.5 days. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study focused on the procurement process at Company XYZ. It was observed that the average PR-to-PO cycle 
time was far from benchmarks. Further analyses showed that vendors respond slowly to RFQ/RFPs sent by 
procurement staff. Among the root causes identified was the limited functionality of the existing information system, 
resulting to the RFQ/RFP process being manually performed. 
 
To address this gap, a new platform was proposed which can be integrated with the existing procurement 
information system. With the new platform, procurement staff and vendors can have a common interface to prepare 
and float RFQ/RFPs (client side), and review and respond to RFQ/RFP (vendor side). This solution is expected to 
reduce PR-to-PO cycle time by 46%.

Abstract 
 
Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is utilized to correlate the process parameters to the output permeate flow rate 
for a Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant. Thorough residual analysis robust regression provided 
alternative methods to predict the response with higher accuracy compared to basic MLR analysis. Robust 
regression methods are developed in this study to predict the productivity of a seawater reverse osmosis plant based 
on key empirical correlations. The robust regression methodology considers important input operating parameters 
such as feed flow rate, feed pressure, outlet pressure of the multi-media filter, inlet and outlet cartridge filter 
pressures, outlet pressure of the high-pressure pump, and inlet seawater flow rate to pressure exchanger and 
correlates them to the permeate flow rate. The robust regression models are capable of accurately predicting 
response for any input operating parameters for the reverse osmosis plant. The regression models demonstrated 
strong statistical goodness-of-fit measures using Huber’s method in terms of three-way interactions with a high R2 of 
approximately 0.99 and a mean absolute percentage error of 2.4%. Furthermore, the robust regression results have 
been validated experimentally and the results showed very good agreement with measured values, with an error of 
approximately 0.8%.

1. Introduction  
Drought is one of the “most dangerous” far-reaching of all-natural disasters on earth, according to the United 
Nations (UN, 2018) (Haile et al. 2020). Water scarcities have emerged as a result of population growth, rising living 
standards, and rapid development while more than 97% of the earth’s water cannot be used for direct human 
consumption (e.g., drinking water) due to its high salinity (Bashitialshaaer 2020). According to the World Bank's 
data on renewable, internal freshwater resources per capita have decreased by half in the last 50 years, from 12,000 
m3 in 1967 to 5732 m3 in 2017. Furthermore, there are more than 2.8 billion people which representing more than 
40% of the world's population, living within 100 kilometers of the coast, and therefore, desalination is often used to 
solve freshwater scarcity in several parts of the world (Zapata-Sierra et al. 2022). Seawater desalination is an 
innovative technology that can provide sustainable solutions to water crises leading to rapidly increasing global 
desalination capacity, from 8000 m3/day in 1970 to about 92.2 million m3/day in 2020 (Bashitialshaaer 2020). More 
than 300 million people rely on water produced by 18,426 desalination plants in 150 countries, which provide more 
than 86.8 million m3/day, according to the International Desalination Association (IDA) 2015 (Baawain et al. 2015). 
Egypt's water gaps are rapidly expanding due to rapid population growth and limited water resources where the total 
renewable water resources per capita are 584.2 m3 /year with a 98.26 % water dependency ratio, according to 
(AQUASTAT*, 2018). In addition to the increasing need for water among the upper Nile Basin countries may result 
in a water shortage, as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) represents a real threat to Egypt's share of the 
river's water (Abd Ellah 2020).  An amount of 27.91 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM) of Egypt's water resources is 
expected to be lost as a result of the GERD (El-Nashar et al. 2018). According to the National Water-Food (NWF) 
*AQUASTAT is the FAO global information system on water resources and agricultural water management.

While Tukey's Biweight method has higher R2 and F-Ratio in ANOVA, Huber’s method develops higher accuracy 
in experimental validation because robust weighting as Huber’s method considers down weights of residual analysis 
while Tukey's Biweight method considers zero weighting for outliers, evidenced by the comparative error analysis 
shown in Figure 8. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Robust regression provides an alternative approach to basic multiple linear regression that works through a robust 
residual analysis to minimize the influence of outliers. In addition, more independent variables are generated as a 
result of the interactions of the input variables, which are analyzed to generate strong statistical correlations using 
robust methods. Four different robust regression models have been developed using Huber's and Tukey's Biweight 
methods. Their performance was evaluated in terms of R2, mean square error, root mean square error, and mean 
absolute percentage error. 
 
From the statistical analysis carried out in this study, the following could be concluded: 
1. Multiple linear regression performs poorly without input data preprocessing. 
2. Three-ways interactions have a higher accuracy performance, as expected. 
3. In terms of up to three-way interactions, Tukey's Biweight method provides the highest R2 after robust

Abstract 
 
Cloud computing's popularity has been dominant in the IT industry over the past year. One of the widely-used cloud 
platforms among the business organization is the Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), an integrated cloud-based 
service that offers real-time document collaboration and increased cloud storage capacity. In this paper, the cloud 
platform was utilized to create an online computer-based information system (CBIS) for utilities data management 
and processing to eliminate work handoffs and prevent human error throughout the utilities billing information 
processing for a property management services company. The proposed CBIS, called UBIS (Utilities Billing 
Information System), also aims to automate the traditional manual generation of forms and reports required in the 
utilities data processing. The first three phases of the SDLC Waterfall Model were used as a guide in developing the 
proposed online CBIS - systems planning, systems analysis, and systems design. In the system review, five manual 
processes are identified that can be automated, and four out of these five processes are also considered unnecessary 
work handoffs. The use case diagram, system flowchart, and dataflow diagram (DFD) were used in the system 
design. The four work handoffs were eliminated in the system testing, and the five manual processes were 
automated successfully through the UBIS using Google Workspace. The criteria analysis using a scoring model is 
used to evaluate the proposed UBIS and the traditional system. Results show that the UBIS is the better system 
overall by scoring higher in 6 out of 8 criteria based on the company's business model.

1. Introduction 
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is defined as a ubiquitous 
model for convenient and on-demand access to a shared network of computing resources (e.g., servers, networks, 
data storage, tools & applications) that can be quickly provided and serviced with minimal management 
involvement of the service provider (Mell and Grance 2011). Under this definition, a computing capacity will 
qualify as a cloud service if the cloud model has the five essential characteristics - on-demand self-service, broad 
network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service (Satyanarayana 2012). There are three 
service models of cloud computing, as listed as well in NIST definition of cloud computing, which are the software 
as a service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) (Rani and Ranjan 2014).

For the assets and resources review, cloud computing in general poses challenges in data security (Oredo et al. 
2019). Since Google Workspace is a SaaS type of cloud computing, the control of the platform is less. However, 
Google is known for its reliable security and is committed to continuous improvements of this critical aspect (Zurier 
2022). Hence, for the Stronger Control, the old system has a weighted score of 0.60, which is higher than 0.45 of 
UBIS. Also, although the updates and maintenance of the cloud platform are part of the paid services, the UBIS 
requires more comprehensive management of the cloud folders and customization in applications, compared to the 
old system that is easier to maintain. Hence, the old system still has a higher weighted score of 0.40 in Ease of 
Maintenance compared to 0.30 of the UBIS. 
 
Nevertheless, the UBIS is still clearly more advantageous in terms of less labor & utility cost and less risk to 
obsolescence with a weighted score of 0.40 and 0.20, compared to the old system with a weighted score of 0.30 and 
0.10, respectively. The higher score in labor & utility cost of UBIS is due to the reduction of man-hours with faster 
processes brought by the automation and work handoffs elimination, which consequently reduces the utility needs 
such as the office facilities and computer use. Lastly, the higher score of UBIS in terms of the Obsolescence Risk is 
obviously due to the continuously growing cloud computing and increasingly automating of business processes, 
while the old system has been obsolete by itself already. 
 
7. Conclusions and  Recommendations 
While the use of Google Workspace in creating the proposed UBIS was successful, more functions in the cloud 
platform can be used and integrated to improve business processes. Other cloud platforms can also be used with 
their wide variety of business applications (King 2013) and solutions to information infrastructure and cross-system 
communication challenges among the service industry (Ratnam et al. 2014), educational institutes (Ruangvanich & 
Piriyasurawong 2019), and in transport logistic industry (Benotmane et al. 2017).

Abstract 
 
Food delivery services have become the main connection between consumers and restaurants during the COVID-19 
pandemic in Thailand. Many sectors are affected and must adapt to survive. This study aimed to explore and assess 
food delivery's importance and satisfaction scores from a customer perspective during the COVID-19. Then, 18 
service attributes in terms of tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy were developed based on a 
SERVQUAL and the questionnaires were designed and used. Then, the descriptive analysis, the paired T-Test, gap 
value, and importance-satisfaction analysis were performed to evaluate the satisfaction of the food delivery service. 
The gap analysis showed that 16 attributes were under expectation. Similarly, there were significant differences 
between importance and satisfaction scores in 15 attributes. An IS analysis showed that the food delivery service 
provider should improve in assurance attributes such as privacy and security of the user's personal information, 
management and control of food safety and food hygiene throughout the delivery to the customer, and knowledge of 
preventive measures against COVID-19. In summary, food delivery service providers should focus on food safety 
and other standards to assure the quality of food delivery services in Thailand.

1. Introduction  
Food delivery services have become the majority connection between consumers and restaurants during the COVID-
19 pandemic. The severe and rapidly spreading epidemic situations caused by the coronavirus, or COVID-19 has 
affected many industrial sectors such as airline and tourism, food industries and society, public health, the economy, 
etc. The governments in many countries had to seriously introduce self-defense practices by keeping a social 
distancing from various enforcement measures used to contain the epidemic, such as lockdowns, curfews, and 
temporary closures of some businesses and activities to suppress and slow down the spread of this virus, so many 
sectors such as restaurants and hotels were affected (Ozili and Arun 2020). A new normal has been created in daily 
lives during the COVID-19 situation to drive the economy and society (Baum and Hai 2020). Operating procedures 
of business and consumer buying and eating behavior have changed (Sheth 2020). Many restaurants have adapted 
their business models to address the challenge and focus on online delivery (Gavilan et al. 2021), while consumers 
cannot sit and dine in the restaurant. Hence, consumers, food, and consumption that ever have a relationship were 
significantly affected (Byrd et al. 2021). Food safety and delivery hygiene are the other concerns of customers 
(Duda-Chodak et al. 2020; Faour-Klingbeil et al. 2020). According to a delivery survey of the Electronic 
Transactions Development Agency (2020), the main reasons 80.37% of respondents in Thailand do not want to go to 
the restaurant to dine in, 57.63% of respondents do not want to waste time in line to buy food, and 47.04% get the 
in-app discount. It is predicted that the volume of food delivery will increase by 18.4-24.4% compared to 2020 
(Kasikorn Research Center 2021). Since the behavior and lifestyle of the customer change, customer satisfaction 
with services is the important factor that impacts the choice and use of food delivery services. Therefore, 
SERVQUAL and The Importance-Satisfaction (IS) analysis are taken to assess service quality and to rank the 
attributes of the customer satisfaction factors in food delivery service during the COVID-19 epidemic in our study.  
 
Based on the situation above, food delivery services are the salient link between consumers and restaurants in 
Thailand during the pandemic. Therefore, we are interested in and try to study the user's opinion on this service. The 
purposes of this study are to survey customer satisfaction with the food delivery services using SERVQUAL, to

1079","including friendliness and politeness of the food rider (T1), cleanliness and condition of delivery containers/boxes 
(T3), the accuracy of food items ordered and delivered (R2), the accuracy of bill/payment of food and services (R3), 
the accuracy of delivery location (R4) and display of ordering status of the platform/application (S4). The food 
delivery service providers performed well in these attributes and should maintain good quality since these attributes 
were very important.  In a quadrant of Low Priority, there were six attributes. Hence, food delivery service providers 
should not focus on these attributes now, but maintain the current levels of intention to improve after the 
improvement of A1, A2, and A3. These attributes were the cleanliness of food rider apparel (T2), short delivery time 
(S1), the availability of instructions to use the platform/application (S3), the number of restaurants participating in 
the platform/application (S5), the understanding customer needs (E1) and low service fees and frequent promotions 
(E2). The last quadrant is Possible Overkill which included three attributes: the condition of the food delivery 
vehicle (T4), the reputation, credibility, the quality of the platform/application (R1), and the convenience in 
platform/application usage (S2). It implied that the customers were very satisfied with these attributes although their 
importance was not very high. 
 
5. Conclusion  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, food delivery services have become the solution for restaurants and food 
producers to reduce the contact. The study of current satisfaction and importance score of food delivery service 
attributes showed that there were gaps to improve. Most customers required them to focus on assurance attributes 
such as privacy and security of the user's personal information, food handling, and control to be safe and hygienic 
throughout the delivery to the customer, and knowledge of preventive measures against COVID-19. In addition, in 
the customers' opinions, the food delivery service providers should strive for food management and control of safety 
and hygiene throughout the delivery. They should have suitable temperature control for each food category, such as 
cooked food, ready-to-eat food, fresh food, etc. The delivery container/boxes should have a separate zone for food. 
This encourages food delivery service providers to focus on food safety and related standards to assure the quality of 
food delivery services in Thailand.

Abstract 
 
Jakarta’s massive economic growth has led to rapid urbanization. The urbanization and population growth, 
incommensurate with the infrastructure development, has caused transportation problems. This has triggered the 
government to establish sustainable transportation policies by adopting mass public transportation as a tool to attract 
people to use mass public transportation and reducing private vehicle users. Several modes of mass public 
transportations have been introduced by Jakarta government such as bus and train services, but the number of public 
transport users is still low. One of the causes of the small number of public transport users in Greater Jakarta is the 
low quality of transportation services compared to other modes. Therefore, the government introduces Mass Rapid 
Transit System (MRT) as a new mode of public transportation, the first underground rail system in Indonesia. 
Considered as a new public transportation mode, the provider needs to evaluate the quality service offered to 
persuade people to use it and to retain them. This study aims to assess the importance dimension of service quality 
and customer satisfaction on MRT passengers’ behavior intention using partial least square structural equation 
models (PLS-SEM). This paper will explore the impact of several factors on passenger behavior intention towards 
public transport services. A comprehensive investigation of the factors regarding the relationship between Mass 
Rapid Transit (MRT) service quality and corporate image on customer satisfaction and behavior intention of 
transportation public user is a contribution that will be made through this research. We introduce the development of 
PLS-SEM analysis into an important performance matrix as the basis for formulating a service quality strategy by 
mass rapid transit public transport operators through the House of Quality method.

1. Introduction  
Jakarta’s massive economic growth has led to rapid urbanization. The population of Jakarta in 2021 is 10.9 million 
and it is estimated that more than 16 million people in 2039 Transporation Agency of DKI Jakarta, 2021). The 
urbanization and population growth , which are not commensurate with the infrastructure development, has caused 
transportation problems. Indonesian government is committed to develop urban trains as mass public transportation. 
Public transportation has advantages in terms of energy-saving, environmentally friendly, and has a large capacity 
volume. So that the priority of developing public transportation is an inevitable need to reduce traffic congestion and 
improve people's living and public service standards by the government (Ni et al. 2020). Through the Jakarta-Bogor-
Depok-Bekasi (Jabodetabek) Transportation Master Plan, the government has set a target that the people 
mobilization of using urban public transportation must reach 60% of the total mode share. One of the strategic steps 
taken is the development of a rail-based urban transportation system (Presidential Regulation of the Republic of 
Indonesia No. 55 of 2018). The establishment of an urban railway system is an effective solution in meeting the 
mobility pressures of urban communities. The introduction of a city railway system that is connects with other 
existing public transport networks is expected to have a positive effect on traffic congestion.  
 
The previous studies show that people do not choose public transportation as a mode of travel because the quality of 
transportation services is still low (Paulley et al., 2006; Chowdhury and Ceder, 2016; Ibrahim et al. 2020). Private 
vehicles are attractive because they are more flexible, convenient, private, and faster (Hussain, 2020; Redman et al.,

7. Conclusion 
The aim of this study is to assess the importance dimension of service quality and customer satisfaction on MRT 
passengers’ behavior intention and selecting the strategy to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. PLS-SEM 
can be used as a framework for predicting MRT customer satisfaction and behavior using the proposed research 
model. The result of hypotheses testing shows that among seventeen hypotheses proposed, fifteen hypotheses are 
accepted. All the service quality dimension has a positive and direct effect on perceived service quality. In line with 
that result, perceived service quality has a positive and direct effect on passenger satisfaction and passenger value. 
Both were mediation service quality into passenger loyalty. Using IPMA as extension analysis on PLS-SEM is 
establish in service quality dimension. So, the factors which influence the user satisfaction and behavior with MRT 
and several measures which might improve passenger satisfaction and loyalty were investigated. Based on the 
IPMA result, the responsiveness dimension has the lowest performance value with the highest level of importance. 
Then followed by the tangibility, empathy, reliability, and assurance dimension. Recommendations are given to 
MRT providers to make strategies to improve the quality of MRT services according to ability based on priority 
technical responses and requirements. The main five strategies to be implemented are: 1) conduct the technical and 
soft skill training for operation and maintenance staff, 2) improve train availability and reliability, 3) conduct 
preventive and corrective maintenance to maintain the reliability of train operation, 4) establish standard operating

In practical terms, the findings of this study might also aid researchers or service providers in better identification of 
the factors that influence user satisfaction and loyalty to MRT services. This study also provides an evaluation of the 
service quality level and strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty using a mixed analysis of PLS-
SEM, IPMA, and QFD methods. There are also some limitations and more opportunities for future research. The 
first limitation of our study is that the study considers the limited scope of strategy that only focuses on service 
quality only. Besides that, further research is also being recommended to integrate the Quality Function Deployment 
method with the Kano model to establish more suitable strategies.

Abstract 
 
The aviation industry has established itself to be a driving force behind global advances in technology and innovation, 
enabling lighter, quieter, and more efficient engine and aircraft designs. However, the industry is set to witness a 
paradigm shift by emerging technologies of the future, the likes of robotics, unmanned aerial systems, internet of 
things, artificial intelligence, with the demand for hybrid and electric aircraft as the industry’s response to the climate 
crisis. The information for this research was found using multiple search engines and was gathered by reviewing 
scientific publications, and publication reports from government and professional organizations reporting original 
work in the field of commercial aviation. The selection criteria were to review these publications and provide relevant 
information based on industry trends. This paper discusses the disruptive technologies of the Fourth Industrial 
Revolution that will impact the civil aviation industry in the not-too-distant future and the role of technology 
management in enabling organizations to manage their technological capabilities for sustainable competitive 
advantage. The paper also explores the possible dangers of over dependence on technology, although technology itself 
has a lot of positive outlooks in terms of simplifying life, yet it comes with multiple drawbacks.

Abstract 
 
Maintenance is critical to organizational success and sustainability. Poor maintenance may lead to low productivity 
and a lack of competitiveness. Maintenance performance measures should be aligned with organizational goals. The 
study objective is to determine the overall maintenance performance using some maintenance metrics aligned with 
organizational goals. The Fuzzy Logic Method (FLM) was combined with the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) 
to evaluate organizational maintenance performance. To demonstrate the utility of the approach. A production 
enterprise was selected. The FLM was used to quantify the elementary indicators, allowing for the resolution of 
challenges related to a shortage of time, funds, and expertise. The AHP was used to weight each indicator to determine 
relative significance based on stakeholder ranking. Six strategic factors were considered: technical, financial, internal 
process, support, human resource, and health safety and environment. These combined (FLM and AHP) yielded an 
overall maintenance performance of 0.79, indicating that 79% of strategic objectives were met. The technical, 
financial, and internal process features contributed 70% of the overall maintenance performance. Therefore, these 
should be the focal points for any continuous improvement programs. 
The two-stage model aids in the identification and prioritization of the most important indicators for evaluating 
organizational maintenance performance.

Abstract 
Production enterprises must constantly investigate variations in set goals while maintaining competitiveness. In recent 
times, there has been an explosion in the number of enterprises going into the production of water in Nigeria. Even 
multinational organizations have joined the market. Empirical evidence shows that in the past, retailers of sachet water 
were able to achieve ROI of 60%, while the real producers struggled to be sustainable. In this study, the relative 
efficiencies of four (4) water-producing companies (Decision Making Units (DMUs)) were evaluated over six months.  
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models were formulated based on six inputs and two outputs.  The inputs included 
data on labour, machines, borehole, water, holding tanks, and cost of production while the outputs were the number 
of sachets and bottled water produced. The efficient producers were identified, and potential improvements were 
suggested for those not as competitive. Further analysis showed that some of the DMUs could have produced 45.7% 
more bottled water using lesser inputs. The models should prove useful as effective decision support for improving 
competitiveness.

Abstract 
Sustainable supply chain management is a new pattern that has emerged recently in industry and companies. The 
procurement process is one of the key factors for efficiency in supply chain management practices. Partnership is one 
of the procurement strategies for strategic items. The success factors of the partnership must be determined to avoid 
things that endanger the financial and operational status of the company. The current supplier partnership research 
focuses on the selection of general criteria and sustainable supplier selection. Currently, there is still limited research 
on the success factors of supplier partnerships that focus on strategic items in the coal mining industry. Meanwhile, 
the procurement of coal mining has its own characteristics and there are regulations related to the procurement of 
goods. Therefore, this research was conducted to determine the categories of goods that are included in the strategic 
items and to design the success factors of supplier partnerships. The main factors studied are general, financial, 
production, reputation, synergies, and sustainable. The research was conducted using the Kraljic method to determine 
the categories of goods that are included in the strategic items. To design a supplier partnership success factor using 
the Hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making method. Integrated Fuzzy AHP-Fuzzy TOPSIS is used to determine the 
weight of the success factors of supplier partnerships and to rank suppliers on the factors used.

Abstract 
 
The construction sector is essential to achieving society's long-term development goals; nevertheless, the shift to 
sustainability is a time-consuming process that poses a leadership challenge. Construction organizations require a 
clear vision, strategy, and direction toward the common goal of a sustainable future. The study will follow a 
quantitative approach and a questionnaire to solicit important information from the respondents. The backdrop of the 
study, problem statement, research questions, aims of the investigation, and importance of the study will be 
discussed. The literature on leadership covers several leadership styles and their possible implications on 
organizational performance and management. Studies have shown that leadership impacts worker performance in 
the construction industry, impacts project success as mediated by leadership styles and help navigate challenges in 
the construction industry. The study's aim was to look at the impact of leadership variables on project performance. 
Leadership traits of factors such as personal integrity, being optimistic, being proactive, having a general business 
perspective, being emotionally intelligent, being skillful, being a systems thinker, and having good time 
management skills are positively related to project success. It is important to note that the success of a project 
manager is not wholly a function of leadership but is influenced by other factors such as the composition of the 
team, project size, organisational structure, project manager’s characteristics, top management support, and the 
specific circumstances of the project. Leadership on the other hand has been identified as a key component in the 
achievement of project success. 
 
Keywords  
Project Management, leadership, management skills, organisational performance, quantitative. 
 
1. Introduction  
The success of a project is based on the effectiveness of project management (Radujković and Sjekavica, 2017). 
Leadership is a key component in the success of projects (Cleveland and Cleveland, 2020; Raziq, Borini, Malik, 
Ahmad, and Shabaz, 2018; Tahir, 2019). Leadership traits of factors such as personal integrity, being optimistic, 
being proactive, having a general business perspective, being emotionally intelligent, being a skillful politician, 
being a systems thinker, and having good time management skills are positively related to project success 
(Cleveland and Cleveland, 2020; Larson and Gray, 2014). It is important to note that the success of a project 
manager is not wholly a function of leadership but is influenced by other factors such as the composition of the 
team, project size, organisational structure, project manager’s characteristics, top management support, and the 
specific circumstances of the project (Larson and Gray, 2014). Simmons, McCall, and Cleg (2020) in their study on 
leadership in the construction industry identify its importance, furthermore, they note that both interpersonal and 
intrapersonal leadership competencies are important in the construction industry.  
 
The construction industry is a billion-dollar industry globally, with the bulk of projects being publicly financed 
(Global M&A Construction Monitor, 2019). The construction sector has its reasonable share of challenges such as

1107","According to the findings of the relationship study between various leadership variables and project success, there 
was a positive, strong, and statistically significant association between project success and external environment 
related factor (r = 0.64; p<0.05), as well as labor and material related factor (r = 0.62; p0.05). Furthermore, the data 
demonstrated a positive medium and statistically significant association between project success and a client-related 
component (r = 0.43; p<0.05) as well as a contractor-related factor (r = 0.38; p0.05). However, there was a minor but 
statistically significant positive link between project success and a measure related to planning effort (r = 0.19). The 
data also revealed a negative medium and statistically significant association between project success and a 
communications-related component (r = -0.40; p<0.05), as well as a consultant-related factor (r = -0.45; p<0.05). 
 
5. Results and Discussion  
5.1  Summary of Main Findings 
Objective 1: To identify the leadership traits associated with project managers in the South African construction 
industry.  
 
Table 10. Ranking of leadership traits 
 
According to the findings, it can be observed that the external environment related factor was ranked first. In second 
place was the labour and material related factor followed by the clients related factor. The planning effort related 
factor was ranked last. The project’s success related factor also identified in the study consisted of 5 items measured 
on a 5-point likert scale. The mean of the scale for the respondents was 3.45 (s.d. = 0.90) and Cronbach’s alpha for 
this scale was 0.94.   The mean of the scale for the respondents was 3.54 (s.d. = 0.46) and Cronbach’s alpha for this 
scale was 0.76. The completion period for the project item had the highest factor loading onto the factor whereas the 
item on complexity of the project had the lowest factor loading onto the factor. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The study has gathered insights which are important to both academics and industry practitioners. The study has the 
potential of identifying the leadership factors and traits that managers might need to work on in order to improve 
construction project outcomes. The study has the potential to help construction companies identify potential leaders 
among workers by noticing those exhibiting leadership traits. The study fills an important knowledge gap by 
providing research on an area lacking research. The study can be of use to future scholars. The study has the 
potential of being used by policymakers and industry players in instituting training and employee development 
programmes. To improve the long-term performance of sustainable projects, construction leaders may be able to 
influence or even convert their subordinates. Any construction project's success hinges on the ability of the sector's 
leaders to lead (Amirali, 2016). Some executives prefer a people-focused approach to project completion, while 
others prefer a production-focused one. Elements such as an employee's acceptance of the leader, work 
preparedness, the leader's qualities, and the organization's customs and ethics, impact desired behavior, according to 
Alkahtani (2015), The construction sector is crucial to the economy, and its operations are also critical to meeting 
national socioeconomic development goals such as housing, infrastructure, and employment creation (Anaman & 
Osei-Amponsah, 2007)

Abstract 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on several world industrial sectors, the health industry is 
forced to work harder to suppress the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Not only the industrial sector that accepts, but 
also the economic sector accepts the limits of normal business activities. Several countries have activities both 
nationally and internationally or commonly known as Lockdown. Many countries have experienced an economic 
crisis until they experienced a recession, but there are also several countries that have survived the economic crisis 
due to the Covid-19 pandemic until they do not experience a recession. However, this pandemic has actually become 
an encouragement for job seekers, besides that there must be interest in adjustments, but also the consequences of 
the new system implemented by the company to continue working with limited activities due to the Covid-19 
pandemic. The population used in this study are job seekers who are of working age and preparing to enter the world 
of work. The sample used was 100 respondents and analyzed using path analysis and the help of the third version of 
the SmartPLS application. The results showed that all variables had a positive and significant effect on the decisions 
proposed at the job vacancy provider company.

1. Introduction 
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic that has hit all corners of the world, which not only attacks the world health 
sector but also attacks all sectors, especially the world economic sector. Restrictions are carried out, both semi and 
total area lockouts, commonly known as lockdowns. These efforts are aimed at suppressing the spread of the Covid-
19 pandemic, which has made poor countries worse off, developing countries and developed countries have been 
battered. Almost all aspects of the economy are affected, starting from micro to macro businesses, the performance 
of the manufacturing industry, the financial sector, world trade, export and import to the service sector which is most 
affected by tourism, this pandemic is the tourism service sector owned by each country around the world as shut 
down by the Covid-19 pandemic. Several commodities, such as world oil traded in the West Texas Intermediate 
(WTI) futures contract, fell to minus 37.63 US dollars per barrel, due to the drastic decline in demand from the 
United States and Globally. Until now, world economic activity is still up and down considering global economic 
conditions are colored by uncertainty along with concerns that this pandemic will never end, as well as the 
emergence of a new wave of the Covid-19 variant on the European continent. The World Bank said the crisis 
experienced due to the Covid-19 pandemic caused the worst recession since World War II. Elsewhere, the IMF also 
said that this crisis was the worst since the Great Depression of 1929 which spread throughout the world. In the 
ASEAN region, several countries have also experienced negative economic growth, firstly, Singapore has 
experienced a recession in the first quarter and second quarter with contractions of 0.3% and 12.6%, respectively. 
Furthermore, Thailand experienced a recession, namely negative 2% and 12.2%. And the Indonesian state is more 
""profitable"" than other countries where in the first quarter they grew by 2.97% and in the second quarter they 
experienced a negative number of 5.32%. The World Bank also said that the pandemic and the torment of the global 
economy will have a domino effect, namely, an increase in poverty rates throughout the world. The world bank 
estimates that this pandemic has pushed 71 million and even up to 100 million people worldwide into extreme 
poverty. Then, the unemployment rate will automatically increase due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the 
stalled industrial economic activity. The EOCD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) maps 
that the unemployment rate in April 2020 rose to 8.4% from the position in March where in that month only the

5. Conclusion 
Some conclusions that are expected to provide answers to the problems formulated in this study are as follows: 
Activity Factors Job Search Activities and Job Awareness according to the respondents' views as a whole are in a 
fairly good and significant category. This shows that the Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs and Application 
Intentions are highly dependent on the Job Search Activities and Job Awareness activity factors. So that this is one 
of the factors that need to be considered by job seekers in looking for work and the intention to apply, they must 
raise enthusiasm in Job Search Activities and Job Awareness. Job Search Activities and Job Awareness as a whole 
affect the Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs and Application Intentions. Furthermore, there is the persuasion 
factor which in the eyes of the respondents as a whole is in the very good category and has a significant effect. 
These results indicate that the Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs and Application Intentions are highly 
dependent on the Persuasion factor. So that this is also one of the criteria that need to be considered by job seekers in 
looking for work before there is an Application Intention. The Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs factors in 
the eyes of the respondents as a whole have a fairly good and significant influence on the decision to apply. So these 
results indicate that the decision for Application Intention is strongly influenced and depends on the category of 
Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs. So that this is a criteria that needs to be done by Generation Z in looking 
for work and before there is an intention to apply.

Abstract 
 
During the last few years, video streaming has accounted for the majority of traffic delivered over the Internet, and it 
has grown at a steady rate each year. Netflix is one of the most popular video-on-demand streaming services in 
Indonesia. The goal of this study is to identify and analyze the impact of trust and expected outcome in affecting the 
willingness to pay for Netflix customers in Indonesia, as well as their perceptions of those factors. The quantitative 
sample was selected using convenience sampling for the purposes of this study. The data collection will be 
conducted with the support of Netflix customers in Indonesia, ensuring that respondents have had an opportunity to 
experience Netflix. A survey was conducted to test the stated hypothesis, and data were collected via an online 
questionnaire survey. In this study, the Likert scale is used, with responses to each construct indicator ranging from 
strongly disagree to strongly agree on a 1 to 5 scale. We analyze the data and test the hypothesis using the PLS 
technique with SmartPLS v3.3.3 software. Both constructs appear to have a positive effect on Willingness to Pay.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, as the Internet has become more widely used, individuals have developed a habit of viewing movies 
on the internet. These activities are frequently selected as a substitute for providing entertainment in a convenient 
and timely manner. Users can access video content such as movies, television shows, user-generated videos, music 
videos, and live streaming via online video on demand (VOD) services. Video streaming has accounted for the 
majority of traffic delivered over the Internet during the last few years, and it has continued to grow at a steady rate 
each year. This statement supported in the report stated in Cisco (2020), smartphones market share will be expected 
to increase at a 7% compound annual growth rate (increasing by a factor of 1.4). Connected TVs (which include flat-
panel televisions, set-top boxes, digital media adapters [DMAs], Blu-ray disc players, and gaming consoles) will be 
expected to increase at the next fastest rate (at slightly less than a 6% compound annual growth rate) to 3.2 billion 
by 2023. Over the projection period, personal computers will continue to drop (2.3%). Throughout the predicted 
period, and by the end of 2023, there will be more PCs than tablets (1.2 billion PCs vs. 840 million tablets). 
According to this, video traffic's domination over all other Internet traffic would soon be making it the primary 
online service for the ordinary user. 
 
The majority of business models used in VOD can be classified as one of three types: subscription-based video on 
demand, transactional-based video on demand, or advertisement-based video on demand (Naik 2020). Subscription-
based video-on-demand refers to a service in which a customer signs up for a contract and pays a recurring charge 
(weekly, monthly, or annually) in exchange for unlimited access to the service (Naik 2020). The user pays a one-
time price based on the content watched or resources consumed in a transactional-based video on demand or pay-
per-view. Despite better revenue prospects for fresh and on-demand programming, acquiring and retaining users can 
be tough (Naik, 020). Advertisement-based video on demand is free for users, but marketers pay. Users can log in 
and watch videos for free in exchange for watching adverts. This model is excellent as a complement to the other 
two. A huge audience is required to achieve significant advertisement impressions (Naik 2020). There are services 
that run on mixed or hybrid models, which are designed to optimize content monetization opportunities while also 
providing the consumer with a more personalized experience (Naik 2020).

The proposed hypothesis test will be validated by comparing t statistics to the t table (1.96) and path coefficients to 
0.05. Based on Table 5 the results of hypothesis testing have been carried out show that the expected outcome 
(3.101 ≥ 1.96; 0.002 ≤ 0.05) and trust (4.541 ≥ 1.96; 0.021 ≤ 0.05) have a positive and significant effect on 
willingness to pay. The results obtained support previous research on Augusto, Santos, and Santo (2020), where 
trust has a direct positive effect on willingness to pay, and in expected outcome research in Lin, Hsu, and Chen 
(2013) it has a positive effect on willingness to pay through perceived benefits. Based on these results, it can be 
stated that H1 and H2 are accepted. 
 
4.3 Discussion 
The purpose of this study is to ascertain and investigate the effect of Expected Outcome and Trust on Willingness to 
Pay on Netflix in order to ascertain the elements that influence interaction with Netflix customers in Indonesia. With 
the data in Table 4, it is possible to infer that all submitted hypotheses can be accepted based on the findings of 
hypothesis testing. The findings indicate that both constructs have a positive effect on Willingness to Pay. With a t-
statistic of 4.541, the construct that has the greatest effect on Willingness to Pay Netflix is Trust. In addition, the 
indicator of willingness to pay construct that has the most influence on the construct is ""The price paid for Netflix 
service is appropriate"" with an outer loadings value of 0.874. Based on these findings, the willingness of Indonesians 
to pay for Netflix services is influenced by the price Netflix charges for their subscriptions. If the price is not 
suitable, the user will reject it and allow to switch to another platform at a lower cost or the user will start 
unsubscribing to the service. 
 
In table 4 above, the research significance value is obtained, namely t-statistics of 3.101 > 1.96 with a significance 
level of 0.000 which is less than 0.05 which indicates that the direction of the relationship between expected 
outcomes and willingness to pay is positive and significant. Thus, this study states that the expected outcome that 
affects willingness to pay is acceptable. The indicator ""I can access many movies on Netflix at an affordable price"" 
in the expected outcome construct has the most significant influence on willingness to pay with an outer loadings 
value of 0.821. With this positive relationship, it shows that the higher the expected outcome, it will be followed by 
an increase in willingness to pay. Meanwhile, the significant expected outcome related to willingness to pay means 
that it can be generalized to the entire population where the sample in this study is the population of Netflix service 
users. The service can meet the expectations of its customers if the price of providing content is in line with what 
they should receive. For this reason, it is important for companies to pay attention to the extent to which services can 
realize the expectations that consumers want.  
 
Based on the results of hypothesis testing in table 4, the effect of trust on willingness to pay on Netflix users 
obtained a t-statistic value of 4,541 > 1.96 and a P-values level of 0.000 < 0.05, the results of this calculation show 
that this hypothesis is accepted so that the trust construct has an influence on the willingness to pay to construct 
which indicates an individual's trust in a service performed when choosing the service they will pay for so that the 
conditions for actions taken by Netflix users are influenced by a good level of trust. The indicator has the most 
significant outer loading value ""I believe in the Netflix service"" of 0.927 and also ""I can rely on the Netflix service"" 
of 0.925. The results of this hypothesis indicate that Netflix users’ willingness to pay is influenced by the trust. 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
A growing number of people are watching movies online as the Internet has become more freely available in recent 
years. When it comes to quick and easy entertainment, these options are typically chosen above others. Online video 
viewing is increasing in popularity, and this trend is expected to continue in the near future. An increasing number

1138","of Indonesians are turning to Netflix as a source of video-on-demand entertainment. Service providers can benefit 
from this research by learning more about what makes customers willing to pay for their products or services. 
Findings show that both trust and expectations have a positive effect on willingness to pay. Indonesians' willingness 
to pay for Netflix services is influenced by the price of Netflix's subscriptions. If the price is unsuitable, the user will 
either reject it and allow them to switch to a more affordable platform, or they will begin unsubscribing to the 
service. If the price of supplying content is reasonable in comparison to the value of what they should receive, the 
service will be able to meet its consumers' expectations. Consequently, it is important for organizations to consider 
how well they can meet their customers' expectations when developing services. When a service earns its customers' 
trust, the customer has no reason to be concerned, and the service can be relied upon to provide benefits to its 
customers. 
 
5. 1 Limitation 
The study collected samples throughout a three-week period, ensuring that the samples investigated were less 
variable due to the time constraint. Meanwhile, we have a restricted budget for this study and cannot afford to recruit 
additional participants to complete this research questionnaire. Additionally, because the majority of the sample 
consists of young adults with a median income, this research focuses mostly on middle-class perceptions. As a 
result, we recommend more research to diversity the sample and investigate additional variables that may influence 
willingness to pay for similar or dissimilar services.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia has a diverse culture and historical relics from various tribes, cultures, religions, races. One of his relics is 
the museum. The museum has a very large cultural significance as part of a heritage that has a variety of cultures 
and historical relics from various tribes, cultures, religions, races, namely the Istano Basa Pagaruyung museum (Frey 
1998). This museum is a form of traditional Minangkabau house that is an imitation of the original palace located on 
top of Batu Patah Hill, formerly burned by the Dutch during the riots in 1804. Istano basa Pagaruyung is actually the 
place where the Malay kingdom stood in the past. The residence of the past king became a symbol of the richness of 
Minangkabau culture so that people could visit istano basa pagarutyung. The building in the form of a traditional 
Minangkabau house is divided into several parts. The main room is located at the bottom with several cubicles or 
rooms on the side and back that the kings' married daughters use while for the unmarried king's daughters are 
located on the second floor. For the place of the king's throne is in the living room while to relax is on the top floor 
that was once used now used as a location to display the collection of weapons. 
 
Thus, the purpose of the study to find out the relationship between variables to the motivation of generation z visited 
the istano basa pagaruyung museum. Here are the variables used that curiosity in novelty and knowledge seeking by 
means of mediation such as museum attributes. 
 
2. Literature Review 
According to Decrop (2006) Motivation comes from people's inner state, needs and desires and persuades them to 
perform or continue to perform certain behaviors. According to Priyono; et al. (2016) Motivation is a process of 
motive of giving that allows consumers to work efficiently and effectively with the goal of achieving factors that 
affect motivation including one's needs, goals and perceptions of individuals or groups and how to meet them. 
Basically every tourist traveling is motivated by several factors. McIntosh (1997) and Murphy (1985), Sharpley, 
(1994) explains that motivation-this can be divided into 4 parts, namely 
1) Physical or physiological motivation or physiologically used for relaxation, health, comfort, sports 
activities, relaxing, etc.

Abstract 
 
The rapid development of information technology such as the internet provides convenience for many human 
activities. One of them is the existence of a financial technology product and service in the form of a digital wallet 
that makes it easier for people to make payments and send money. This is a special attraction for people to use 
digital wallets. The increasing number of usage of financial services is in line with the increase in financial 
inclusion. This study analyzes the relationship between the use and adoption of digital wallets on increasing 
financial inclusion in Indonesia. The main data source was obtained from 100 respondents who have used Gopay as 
a digital wallet product. Simple linear regression analysis was used in this study. The findings of this study indicate 
that there is a positive correlation between the use of digital wallets and financial inclusion.

1. Introduction 
Very fast changes and developments in information technology such as the internet, provide convenience for all 
human activities (Mahwadha, 2019) this also has a significant impact on the world economy (Chotiyaputta and 
Savira, 2020). Based on the results of a survey conducted by We Are Social and Kepios, as of February 2022, there 
were 370.1 million mobile phone users and 204.7 million internet users in Indonesia. The increase in the number of 
mobile and internet users has finally led businesses to continue to innovate to respond to the challenges of 
globalization, one of which is innovation in the financial sector as indicated by the existence of a digital wallet. 
 
Digital wallet is part of financial technology, which was developed to provide and facilitate financial services via 
mobile phones (Hinson et al., 2019) such as storing money on servers, conducting transactions, and tracking 
transaction history through a system. Until February 2022, there were 158.7 million Indonesians who made digital 
payments  (We Are Social and Kepios, 2022), the existence of that payment system was supported by changes in 
consumer behavior and increased digitization in many aspects of people's lives (Odei-Appia et al., 2021). 
 
As one of the non-formal financial facilities for payments, digital wallets provide easy access for users, which is 
indicated by the simple requirements for account ownership and does not require fees. In this regard, according to 
the Reserve Bank of India, to achieve financial inclusion, it is necessary to provide access to various financial 
services needed by the community in a safe, comfortable and affordable manner for all levels of society (Bank of 
Indonesia, 2021). This ease of access then changes the way people get services which ultimately makes financial 
technology products such as digital wallets considered as a tool to achieve financial inclusion (Odei-Appiah et al., 
2021). 
 
Equitable public access to financial facilities is seen as an important element in economic growth and poverty 
reduction (Andrew et al., 2021). The ease of registration, practicality in use, and other benefits of adopting and using 
digital wallets are very likely to be a solution for the unbanked society to have access to financial facilities. 
Therefore, this study is intended to analyze the relationship between digital wallet usage and the increase of 
financial inclusion in Indonesia. It is hoped that the results will provide insight for the society and the government in

5. Conclusion 
This study aims to analyze the relationship between the adoption and use of digital wallets on financial inclusion in 
Indonesia. The findings obtained from this study indicate that there is a positive correlation between the use of 
digital wallets and financial inclusion. Digital wallets can provide easier and more affordable financial access to the 
unbanked society and can bring them closer to financial facilities such as account ownership, savings, and credit. 
However, the use of digital wallets to date has not been able to contribute much in increasing financial inclusion in 
Indonesia as much as the access and the use of formal financial facilities such as banks, insurance, financial 
institutions, and so on.

Abstract 
 
Water shortage and the rising cost of water services have been a problem of communities around the world for 
centuries. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) had reported that around one out of ten, approximately 
eleven million people in the Philippines do not have access to improved water sources. Climate change is one of the 
main contributing factors to this problem. UNICEF stated that climate change disrupts weather patterns, leading to 
extreme weather events, unpredictable water availability, exacerbating water scarcity, and contaminating water 
supplies. Such impacts can drastically affect the quantity and quality of water needed to survive. Considering the 
occurrence of such abnormal phenomena, the aim of the study was to assess the quality of water sources in Metro 
Manila (NCR) and create an effective water filtration system that can be used to help reduce the contamination of 
water that Filipino households can utilize. The researchers gathered and analyzed data through comparative analysis, 
together with the support of similar studies, to help determine the optimal amount of components that will be used 
for the filter and establish if the filter is indeed effective in reducing contamination. The obtained results from the 
tests conducted for the seven water quality parameters tests between the Filtered Rainwater and Unfiltered 
Rainwater found that there was a reduction in the contaminants after the filtration of the rainwater using the filter 
prototype.

1. Introduction  
The prevalence of water scarcity is a problem that is affecting different areas of the world, most especially those 
residing in rural areas and those who belong in the poorest sectors of the society. This situation is evident in several 
countries of the world, including the Philippines. Lee et al. (2019) mentioned that the country is ranked 33rd out of 
the 48 countries in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) when it comes to water security. With this impediment, 
people are left with no choice but to rely on unsafe and untreated water sources for their alternative water supply just 
so they could suffice their water needs. However, utilizing such water sources poses serious threats in terms of 
health of the people. Some of the potential risks include infections such as diarrhea, cholera, hepatitis, and typhoid.  
The rapid increase in global population also increases water consumption, thus further depleting water sources than 
it normally should. Kummu et al. (2016) stated that “rapidly increasing populations and increases in total water 
consumption resulted in a nearly 16-fold overall increase in the population under water scarcity within the 20th 
century”. Because of this, safe alternative sources of water are starting to be explored by different sectors and 
organizations as an attempt to alleviate and mitigate the effects of water scarcity. Among the different alternatives 
available is the use of rainwater harvesting system, which Sendanayake (2016) noted to be a feasible supplementary 
source of water especially to countries which have abundant rainfall.

1154",,"nations and countries with a large body of water source, are expected to have enough water to meet household, 
industrial, agricultural, and environmental needs; however, resulting to not being optimized due to the lack of 
sustainable means to provide it in an accessible manner to all its people. As the research led to an analysis that there 
is truly a grave problem for a need for reliable and usable water resources, the proponents initialized the application 
of an efficient rainwater harvesting and filtration system for the Filipino households. 
 
The study found that collecting rainwater can be considered a sustainable source of household water that can adverse 
the effects of water scarcity in the Philippines and address the volume of wastewater or stormwater runoff during the 
rainy season. Moreover, the study also showed the effectiveness of coconut shells as an alternative material for 
producing activated carbon in a rainwater filtration system, its effectiveness to reduce or eliminate contaminants in 
rainwater, and its viability when adopted in the Philippines. The collection of rainwater could help as well in the 
economical aspect of the nation to reduce costs for managing water collected by the Ipo, La Mesa, and Angat Dam 
and will help the LGUs to prioritize water sanitation is considered to be a top essential to elevate the quality of 
health.  
 
In line with this, the proponents successfully actualized a small-scale prototype of a Rainwater Filtration System 
with the activated coconut carbon as an innovative integrated component to filter rainwater samples obtained from 
the subject site. The formulated Filter prototype is an idea by the researchers to mitigate the effects of water scarcity 
that could help Filipino households access a water source that could be used for industrial purposes. In addition, the 
optimal mixed-ratio and the type of components inside the system, particularly the gravel, sand, and the activated 
coconut carbon with a percentage ratio of +-33%: +-30%: +-16% were also figured and applied to the biofilter. The 
Filter prototype was used to filter fifteen (15) rainwater samples that were analyzed through the seven (7) water 
parameters to find if the results are on par with the Global Water Quality Standards and if there is truly a reduction 
of contamination of the filtered rainwater as compared to the unfiltered rainwater. 
 
6.1 Summary of Water Analysis  
The researchers analyzed unfiltered and filtered rainwater by gathering necessary data through samples of rainwater 
from Las Piñas, Metro Manila. Rainwater was collected during heavy rainy days and filtered through the activated 
coconut carbon filtration system to test the characteristics and performance. The filtered rainwater then, along with 
other sources of water and unfiltered rainwater, is then sent to the water testing laboratory to determine the water 
quality from these sources.   
 
In the analysis of the seven (7) water quality parameters between the Filtered Rainwater and Unfiltered Rainwater, it 
was found that there was a reduction in the contaminants after the filtration of the rainwater, particularly in the TSS 
parameter and the Fecal Coliform parameter.  
 
The two groups are then compared to the Class A standards for freshwater and assessed if they comply with the 
standards. It was found from the means of the Filtered Rainwater that it complies with the Class A standards for all 
water quality parameters. However, from the means of the Unfiltered Rainwater, it was found that all the 
parameters, except for the pH level, do not comply with the standards set for each water quality parameter.

Abstract 
 
Improving buildings’ energy efficiency while preserving indoor thermal comfort conditions of hot climate regions 
has been within the high-interest topics among academics. Researchers have noted that achieving both concepts is 
essential to improve buildings’ sustainability and energy management system. Therefore, it pushes the need to 
conduct a comprehensive review to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure solid foundations for 
future research. This paper aims to present a review on the state-of-art of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to integrate better building energy management systems. This is achieved 
through a systematic literature review of 30 related papers from the past ten years. The paper argues that very few 
studies demonstrate the implementation of IoT-AI based methods in the building industry, and its full potential is 
not realized yet. Therefore, it calls for more attention from academics within the application perspective in the 
related field.

Abstract 
 
Anthropometric data remain an essential requirement for designing safe and comfortable facilities and workstations. 
Anthropometric data collection using manual measuring instruments employs many measurers because they are 
generally slow and time-consuming. Using multiple measurers introduces the challenge of inter-rater reliability 
because the measurers may be selected from different professions and cadres despite the initial training for the 
measurement exercise. This study analyzes the inter-rater reliability of the anthropometric data measured by lecturers 
and students to determine if the different cadre affects the measurement's reliability. Two lecturers and two final-year 
students participated in the measurement test. After the initial two-day training, fifteen anthropometric dimensions for 
38 students were measured using the standard anthropometric measuring instrument. The students were divided into 
two groups, and each group of measurer measured both groups at different sessions. A retest was conducted on 5-6 
days after the first test. An average measure two-way random effect with absolute agreement at a 95% confidence 
interval was selected for the analysis. The results show that the vertical anthropometric dimensions such as stature, 
shoulder height, and sitting height have excellent inter-rater correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.9 to 0.98. Other vertical 
anthropometric dimensions such as knee height, popliteal height, and eye height have ICC ranges of 0.8 to 0.9. 
However, dimensions that have to do with body length, such as buttock to popliteal and knee lengths, shoulder breadth, 
etc., have ICC values of 0.4 to 0.8. All dimensions that require a change of posture during measurement also recorded 
low ICC. The study shows that inter-rater reliability was affected by the availability of landmarks, posture, and 
participants' orientation. Therefore, if possible, professionals should measure dimensions with significant variability.

Abstract 
 
The central market Birnin Kebbi has been identified as one of the noisiest locations in the Capital city of Kebbi State, 
located in North-West Nigeria. The milling section of the market is a major contributor to noise pollution. The area is 
also one of the busiest because its access gate is close to a parking lot, thereby exposing the operator and their 
customers to noise and other visitors who want fast access into the market. A major source of noise is the diesel-
powered internal combustion engines, which are the convenient choice because of the country's economy and standard 
of living. This study investigates the effect of a recent relocation of the milling section on the noise level and the 
different impacts such relocation has on machine operators' health and economy. The noise level at both locations was 
measured using a noise level meter for five consecutive days from 9 am to 3 pm each day. The traffic intensity at both 
locations were also compared, while a survey among the operators was conducted to determine the health and 
economic impact of the relocation on them. The Activity Relationship (AR) and To-Fro charts were used to assess the 
impact of the relocation on customers' patronage. The result showed that while the noise level remained high above 
the harmful level of 85dBA, the effect on population decreased significantly as people exposed to noise reduced from 
100/m2/minute to 20/m2/minute during peak hours. However, The AR and to-Fro analysis revealed a significant 
increase in the distance covered between the milling section and other sections that are auxiliary to milling. This 
finding also correlates with the reported decrease in the patronage level of customers and job satisfaction of the milling 
operators. Therefore, there is the need to adopt an optimized layout that will relocate the axillary sections closer to the 
milling section with minimal exposure to noise. Also, there is a need for increased awareness among operators on the 
short-term and long-term effects of excessive noise pollution. The market administrators also need to adhere to sound 
level standards in the country.

Abstract 
 
Nigeria and the world, by extension, generate enormous amounts of agricultural waste and residue. These wastes, 
which are inappropriately deposed off either by unplanned landfilling, burning or indiscriminate dumping, are a 
menace to society. In an effort to reduce the degradation and pollution load of these wastes on the environment, they 
are being geared towards recycling and reuse as a potential resource in meeting the increasing demand for easily 
attainable, cost-effective, efficient and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment alternatives. This study reviews 
the various adsorbent types and recent use of agricultural wastes as viable adsorbents in the society. The study 
therefore serves as a blueprint for the elimination of various contaminants from wastes.

1. Introduction 
Environmental pollution all over the globe is gradually reaching an alarming stage with several countries beginning 
to develop technologies to tackle this menance (Ogbonna and Mafimisebi, 2016). Pollution can be defined as the 
introduction of solid, liquid or gaseous materials into the surrounding at a faster rate than it can decompose, dilute, be 
recycled, or stored in a harmless form (Ajibade et al., 2021). One of such technologies developed is adsorption. The 
rapid separation of an adsorbate (the substance that is adsorbed) from liquid to a surface (also known as Adsorption 
Technology), is the most preferred method for pollutants removal from effluent water via an adsorbent (the solid 
whose surface adsorbs the substance) (Hu and Xu, 2019). This study was therefore an attempt to review various 
adsorbent types and recent use of agricultural wastes as viable adsorbents in the society.

Abstract 
 
Nanotechnology is the branch of science and engineering that involves the study of particles at a dimension of as low 
as between 1 and 100 nanometers. These fine particles, referred to as nanoparticles, mostly are undetectable by human 
eyeand they find wide application in various fields ranging from drug delivery and chemotherapy, magnetism, optics, 
because of their remarkable traits and endearing properties they possess.This study therefore reviews the recent 
advancements in nanotechnology and nanoparticles. It dealt with different approaches in synthesis nanoparticles. The 
physicochemical properties and classifications of nanoparticleswere highlighted in the review.

1. Introduction 
Nanotechnology is among the most exciting and fast-moving scientific disciplines today. It is essentially a modern 
scientific discipline that is continually evolving as academic and commercial interest grows and as novel research is 
presented to the world of science(Pal et al., 2011). The simplest definition of nanotechnology is “technology on the 
nanoscale” (Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the definition of the nanoscale is indispensable for the 
definition of nanotechnology, which is a scale ranging between 1 to 100 nanometres (nm) (Ramsden, 2016). The prefix 
of the term “nanotechnology” is derived from the ancient Greek etymon “Nanos” and the Latin etymon “Nanus”, 
signifying dwarf or extremely small. By convention in the International System Units (SI), nano refers to 10-9 power 
or one-billionth of a meter (Salman-Ali, 2020). In these terms, it refers to a nanometre,  which is on the scale of the 
diameter of an atom (Wani, 2017). Nanotechnology involvestiny materials that are undetectable to neither the naked 
eye or a traditional light microscope ( Ramsden, 2016). ""Nanometre"" was a concept that was first proposed by Richard 
Adolf Zsigmondy. He proposed the term nanometre for explicitly characterizing and measuring the size of particles 
such as colloids with the use of a microscope (Ramsden, 2016).  Richard Feynman (oftentimes regarded to as the

Abstract 
 
Information technology has been widely used in many industries in recent days, and many companies use 
outsourcing services through managed service schemes with revenue sharing patterns. To maintain the services, the 
managed  service providers  need to have a well-planned maintenance activities for both preventive  and corrective 
purposes. Several operational parameters of maintenance are the number and location of the technician depot. These 
parameters must be determined optimally to meet the targeted service level. Meanwhile, there are some constraints 
that make the service providers require to design the optimum maintenance travel route for the maintenance 
technicians. This research use a case research of a service provider and adopts a vehicle routing problem (VRP) 
concept to develop an optimum route to support the maintenance activities for information technology infrastructure. 
To define the location of the depots and the maintenance routes, an algorithm of integrated location and technician 
routing problem with profits and time windows is developed. The numerical experiments show that the algorithm 
provides a better solution compared to the existing practice in the case research. This work provides not only a better 
solution and simple practice for the service provider companies but also enrich the literature in the development of 
VRP concept.

1. Introduction 
The development of internet of things (IoT) technology is primarily driven by the need for large enterprises to get a 
foresight based on the predictability provided by the ability to keep up with the flow of all objects (materials or 
services) flowing through the commodity chain or enterprise supply chain (Lianos, 2000). In an industrial 
environment, it is characterized by the use of interconnected computers, smart materials, smart machines and 
instruments that communicate with each other, interact with the environment, and ultimately make decisions with 
minimal human involvement (Gilchrist, 2016). 
 
The trend of the use of information and digital technology in the industrial sector, as well as the need for fast and 
precise data and information and on a large scale, makes many companies that transform the use of information and

From the results of data processing and analysis above, it can be concluded that for the research object of 15 
Customer locations it takes 2 depots of operations technicians and maintenance, namely Depot 1 (Provider Office) 
which serves 7 Customers and Depot 2 (Site Operation Gubeng) to serve 8 Customers. While in determining the 
vehicle travel route of the maintenance technician team, it can be concluded that it must be done to break the route 
into 2 routes in order to meet the limit that the vehicle must return to the depot before business hours end, with the 
total cost for both depots is Rp. 176,333 per travel cycle. The existence of these 2 routes  became the basis for 
Provider Management to determine the operational policy, whether the addition of the team and fleet of vehicles or 
maintenance scheduling the next day. The use Location and Routing Problem with set covering  models and team 
orienteering problems with profits and time windows can solved by an exact and  heuristic approach that meet the 
objective function and limitations, but need to be compared with other methods in anticipation for  local optimum 
phenomena. 
For the further research, this research can be extended by considering application of the model to a larger number of 
objects. Adding more restrictions in accordance with the actual conditions in different cases may also be required to 
enable the algorithm to implement.

Abstract 
 
Every company engaged in the manufacturing industry must implement a productivity improvement program. In 
avoiding the occurrence of queues in the manufacturing process, an overall solution is needed. One that is often used 
in scheduling systems is the flow shop pattern. FCFS are the most widely used methods, this method schedules work 
without paying attention to makespan, so that with this method there are often delays and inefficient production 
costs. According to Utami (2020) the CDS method produces a better solution than the FCFS but Jin et. Al (2007) 
state that the NEH method produces a more optimal solution than the CDS method, but the NEH method provides a 
longer computational time. The purpose of this study was to develop a new method for solving flow shop scheduling 
problems based on the concept of the CDS and NEH methods namely NEHLPD, NEHLPD1, NEHLPD2 and then 
tested them on random cases. Based on the results of running on 30 cases, it was found that: NEHLPD produces 
more efficient makespan than the CDS method and the NEH method where the average efficiency level is 3.56% 
and 0.28%, respectively; NEHLPD1 produces 9.67% faster computational time than the CDS method and 74.72% 
than the NEH method; NEHLPD2 produces a processing time of 12.41% faster than the NEH method and produces 
an average makespan solution of 1.84% better than the CDS method and only 1.49% worse than the makespan of 
NEH method.

1. Introduction 
Every company engaged in the manufacturing industry must implement a productivity improvement program. In 
carrying out its activities, the company must have a good manufacturing process (Utami et al., 2020). The increasing 
use of operations research in various fields of science is a result of industrial progress. In avoiding the occurrence of 
queues in the manufacturing process, an overall solution is needed. One that is often used in scheduling systems is 
the flow shop pattern (Gozali et al., 2019) 
 
Flow shop is the process of determining the sequence of jobs that have the same product path. The flow shop model 
is a job that is considered as a collection of operations where a special precedence structure is applied. The 
arrangement of a flow shop type production process can be applied precisely to products with stable designs and 
produced in large volumes, so that special-purpose investments used are quickly returned (Pinedo, 2001). 
 
The Campbell Dudeck and Smith (CDS) method is the most important heuristic method for the makespan problem 
or the time to produce all jobs to completion in the flow shop scheduling problem (Campbell et al., 1970). 
According to Baker (1974) the Campbell Dudeck and Smith (CDS) method has advantages in two respects: The use 
of Johnson's rules is used to find job sequences involving 2 groups of machines as a processing tool for incoming 
jobs. Jobs that are processed must go through two groups of machines, the M1 machine and continue on the M2 
machine until it is finished. CDS usually produces several sequences that can be selected as the best solution. 
 
According to Utami (2020) the CDS method produces a better solution than the FCFS, Palmer and Dannenbring 
methods but the CDS method has weaknesses:

6. Conclusion 
After carrying out a valid computerization process and testing the method using hypothesis data on random cases, 
the development methods, namely NEHLPD, NEHLPD1 and NEHLPD2, have their respective advantages and 
disadvantages. If we are concerned with the most optimal solution, then NEHLPD is very suitable to be used in 
finding solutions to flow shop scheduling problems. Where this method produces an average makespan is more 
efficient than the CDS method and the NEH method where the average efficiency level is 3.56% and 0.28%, 
respectively. 
 
However, if we are concerned with the speed of computation time in generating solutions to the flow shop 
scheduling problem, the NEHLPD1 method is suitable for use because it produces 9.67% faster computational time 
than the CDS method and 74.72% than the NEH method. 
 
Meanwhile, if we are concerned with the makespan value and computation time, the NEHLPD2 method is suitable 
to be applied because it produces a processing time of 12.41% faster than the NEH method and produces an average 
makespan solution of 1.84% better than the CDS method and only 1.49% worse than the makespan of NEH method.

Abstract  
 
Ergonomics is the study of the kind of work people do, the machines and tools they use and the environment they 
work in to perform the work. Most of the small scale industries are surrounded by ergonomic deficiencies and 
occupational health and safety issues. The present study is focused on identifying the ergonomic problems in 
traditional small scale industries like dal mills (pulse processing) and oil ghani (oil mill). Most of these industries are 
a part of the unorganized sector in India, engaged in production of goods with primary objective of generating 
employment and contributes to the economy. The objective of study is to find out ergonomic shortcomings in the 
workplace and recommend suitable measures to improve the efficiency and productivity. About 5 oil mills and 5 dal 
mills are selected and demographic data of workers is collected. Musculoskeletal discomfort questionnaire and 
visual analogue scale were administered to know the prevalence of MSDs in different body parts and overall 
discomfort. Postural analysis using RULA and REBA was carried out to determine the risk levels due to awkward 
postures. Environmental parameters like noise, heat and illumination were measured using appropriate instruments. 
The results of MSD questionnaire indicate about 45%-60% discomfort in lower back, upper back and shoulders.  
The VAS score is 47% in oil mill workers and 58% in dal mil workers. The postural analysis indicated about 32% 
and 39% workers in high risk category in oil mill and dal mill respectively. In some activities in both industries high 
noise is prevalent. The poor working conditions and negligible use of personnel protective equipment add to the 
discomfort and health of the workers. Several ergonomic interventions like engineering controls and administrative 
controls are recommended so that the workers health and safety levels improves that leads to overall satisfaction and 
increase in productivity.

Abstract  
 
In a market with a fierce level of competition, loyal customers are needed to be able to stay competitive. In this era 
of connectivity, loyalty can be increased through customer engagement on a brand's social media account. Sociolla 
is a beauty e-commerce platform that uses social media to increase brand loyalty through customer engagement. 
This study aims to analyze the effect of social media marketing on brand loyalty through customer engagement on 
Sociolla's Instagram account. The research uses descriptive-causal with a quantitative approach using purposive 
sampling, given to 100 respondents. This study uses structural equation modeling (SEM). The data was processed 
using the SmartPLS 3.3 software. The results obtained in this study are social media marketing has a positive and 
significant effect on customer engagement, customer engagement has a positive and significant effect on brand 
loyalty, social media marketing has a positive and significant effect on brand loyalty, and social media marketing 
has an indirect effect on brand loyalty through customer engagement. For this reason, Sociolla should consider 
improving social media marketing because it will affect customer engagement and brand loyalty.

1. Introduction  
It is undeniable that the internet seems to be a primary need for society globally. Almost every activity carried out is 
always connected to an internet connection, such as the process of finding information, communicating, transacting, 
shopping, and even doing business. Lifestyle changes that become completely online provide great opportunities for 
the business sector. The increasing interest in online shopping has triggered the emergence of various e-commerce in 
Indonesia. Electronic commerce or what is commonly known as e-commerce is defined as a way of shopping online 
or direct selling that utilizes internet facilities. Reporting from the 2021 Bank Indonesia (BI) Annual Meeting report, 
it is predicted that e-commerce will grow to 31.4% in 2022. This growth not only provides opportunities but also 
stiff competition. Sociolla is a beauty e-commerce that is growing very rapidly throughout 2021. However, there is 
no guarantee that Sociolla will be able to compete in a highly competitive market.  
 
In a market with a high level of competition, it will be more effective to keep consumers from switching to other 
brands (customer loyalty) than to find new consumers (Tjiptono, 2000). Brand loyalty is one of the most important 
keys in winning a market with intense competition, where a brand can maintain its sustainability by retaining 
consumers (Yavas et al in Wibowo, 2019). Informing brand loyalty, companies must be able to influence consumer

In addition, the path coefficients between Social Media Marketing variables and Brand Loyalty through Customer 
Engagement have a value of 0.175. The value of these path coefficients indicates the direction of a positive 
relationship, which can be interpreted as increasing Social Media Marketing, it will be followed by an increase in 
Brand Loyalty in Sociolla, but must create Customer Engagement first. So the hypothesis that Social Media 
Marketing has a significant influence on Brand Loyalty through Customer Engagement is accepted (H0 is rejected, 
H4 is accepted).

Abstract 
 
The new insights in the development of biodegradable composites for packaging industries, using PVA (polyvinyl 
alcohol) and eggshell ash particles (ESAp) were investigated. The composites were produced using the modified 
solution cast method. In the experimentation; 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20wt% ESAp were used in the production of the 
composites. Tensile, Impact energy, Water absorption, Density, and Biodegradability tests were carried out on the 
resulting composites samples to determine their characteristics and composition with the most suitable property for 
mechanical and packaging applications. The composite samples showed variants in mechanical properties according 
to the results obtained from the tests carried out. This led to the conclusion that for optimum mechanical properties 
for packaging applications, bio-composites with the studied composition should be obtained at 15wt%ESAp. It was 
established that the developed composites film can be used in the packaging industries.

1.  Introduction 
In modern societies, petroleum-based synthetic polymers are beeing widely used for a variety of applications, such 
as; polyolefin in packaging, bottle, and molding products (Abdullah et al. 2017). Globally, the annual disposal of 
petrochemical plastics is caped at nearly 150 million tons, which amounts to dangerous environmental problems 
during disposal due to its non-biodegradability, especially with the continuous increase in production and 
consumption of these materials. Moreover, these plastic wastes are capable of resisting microbial attack. This causes 
undesired pollutants in the soil, rivers, and marine environment (Bahrami and Fattahi, 2021).  
 
Nowadays eco-friendly biodegradable polymers receive great attention as the next best alternative to partly or 
completely replace the consumption of petroleum-based plastic materials. These biodegradable polymer materials 
can completely degrade into natural ecosystems such as active sludge, natural soil, lake, and marine without any part 
left as pollutants in the environment (Lal et al. 2020). On the other hand, these eco-friendly polymers are quite 
capable of chemical transformation through the action of biological enzymes, microbes, and microorganisms that act 
on these polymers and break them into non-harmful chemicals, which dissolve into the environment. Several 
researchers have reported that the biodegradability property of the bio-composites has been the most important 
factor for many composites (Yurong and Dapeng, 2020). 
 
Biodegradable composites are used in producing packaging materials for the food packaging industries. The use of 
highly improved packaging materials that can reduce the decline in quality of the food and also have a less toxic 
impact on the environment has always been at the forefront of packaging industries[5]. The constant increase in 
population, resulting in an increasing demand for fresh foods, and quality products have facilitated the increased 
efforts being made by researchers to meet the ever-increasing demands for safe food packaging methods. Food 
packaging helps to increase the shelf-life of the products and to also change the sensory properties of the packaging

The development of the eco-friendly synthesis of films of PVA/waste eggshell (ESp) in water using glycerol as a 
plasticizer was presented in this work. In the course of the work, the following conclusions were made: A 158.33% 
degraded in soil within 30 days, 51.2% improvement in tensile strength, and  16.85% reduction in the water 
absorption were obtained at 15wt%ESp addition to PVA. The results of the biodegradation and mechanical 
properties show that the blend films might be used in sustainable packaging. It was established that waste eggshells 
can be used in the production of polymer films for the packaging industry.

Abstract 
 
Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are promising materials due to their outstanding mechanical and electrical properties. 
However, the electrical percolation threshold obtained in epoxy/carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites is one of 
the lowest among conductive nanocomposites. There exist research efforts to improve the electrical percolation 
threshold of epoxy/CNT with the addition of silver nanoparticles. The aim of this novel work is to use 
biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (GAg.NPs) as a replacement for high-cost Ag.NPs for the enhancement of the 
electrical properties of epoxy/CNT. The nanocomposites were produced by using 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5% CNTs 
and 0.5% GAg.NPs in the epoxy matrix.  The morphology, electrical conductivity and thermomechanical properties 
of the developed composites were determined.  The results show an increment in the electrical conductivity and 
storage modulus of the epoxy/CNT with the addition of GAg.NPs. The work established that the addition of 
GAg.NPs to epoxy-CNT can be used to improve electrical conductivity and storage modulus of epoxy-CNT 
composites for electronic applications.

1. Introduction 
Electrically conductive polymer materials have been proven to be used in fuel cells like printed circuit boards, 
electronic devices, anti-static electricity, electromagnetic shielding, etc (Backes et al., 2017; Md Saleh et al., 2020). 
However, there are little numbers of inherently conductive polymers commercially available in the market today (Jin 
and Park, 2013). Research and development have over the years tried to develop conductive polymer by the addition 
of conductive reinforcement to the non-conductive polymer. The conductive fillers such as graphite, carbon fibers, 
carbon black, metal fibers, metal powder, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), etc have been used successfully in the 
production of the conductive polymer (Rudawska 2020; Hao et al.; 2021; Ma et al. 2014). In all the mentioned 
conductive fillers, CNTs exhibits fascinating usage in the production of the conductive polymer (Ma et al., 2014). 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are normally produced from concentrically-rolled graphene sheets that have asymmetric 
helicity (Backes et al., 2017).  The SP2 of the carbon atoms of the CNTs provide high thermal conductivity as well 
as excellent high electronic and chemical stability (Md Saleh et al., 2020). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the 
conductive materials used in the production of electrically conductive polymer for the electronic industry because 
CNTs possess good electrical conductivity, a large aspect ratio, low mass density and appreciable thermal properties 
(Jin and Park, 2013). However, dispersion of CNTs in polymer have been reported to precipitate agglomeration due 
to strong Van der Waals forces (Rudawska, 2020). This can result in reduction of the electrical and mechanical 
properties. Hybridization of CNTs using inorganic materials helps to enhance the electrical and mechanical 
properties of the composites. The use of low-cost inorganic reinforcement can lower the high cost of CNTs usually 
used in the manufacturing of conductive polymer. Silver inorganic particle is usually used to enhance the better 
dispersion of CNTs in the production of conductive polymer for the electrical and electronic industries (Hao et al.,

structure of the polymer was revealed in Figure 5. There were uniformity in the distribution of CNTs@GAg.NPs, 
which appears as white phases visible in Figure 6. Defect such as segregation of particles was not observed in the 
composites. This white phase can explain can account for the observed higher electrical conductivity and storage 
modulus in the composite. The presence of GAg.NPs @CNTs helps to alter the network multilayer structure of 
CNTs and enhances good interfacial bonding between the polymer and the reinforcement.

1. Introduction  
Technical education is a course of study where students acquired scientific knowledge, skills and attitude to graduate 
as a skilled individual’s ready to be self-employ or get employed. Technical education trades involve the use of hand 
tools, industrial training as well as commercial skills work (Odo et al, 2017). Technical education (TE) prepares 
beginners with careers that are manual or practical skills based such as building technology, woodwork technology, 
painting and decoration, drafting, automobile technology, mechanical technology, and electrical/ electronic 
technology (Ede 2001). Bello et al. (2013) stated that technical Education University graduates preparedness to gain 
flexible employability skills such as emotional intelligence that will enable them compete into a dynamic labour 
market has become a serious challenge. Because, what the graduates were thought in schools and the real labour 
market demand are two different concepts. Despite the fact that the graduates believe that they have enough 
intellectual abilities and technical knowledge to execute their job. On the contrary the students graduated without the 
new knowledge for employability such as interpersonal skills, communication skills, and emotional intelligence 
which are prescribed as the required skills to participate into 21st century world of work (Singh and Singh, 2008; 
Atkins, 1999; Omar et al. 2012; & Varghese, Sager, & Agarwal 2013). Emotional intelligence is a collection of non-
cognitive skills, proficiencies and abilities that guided an individual capacity in adapting new societal demand and 
stress. (Talarico, et. al.2013). Daniel Goleman, (1998, p137) stressed that emotional intelligence is the “capacity for 
recognizing our own feelings and those of others, for motivating ourselves and for managing emotions well in 
ourselves and in our relationship.” to succeed in our career. Emotional intelligence (EI) is a cluster of emotional 
skills, work skills, leadership skills and emotional competency which develop in individuals’ to easily gain 
employment after graduation. Bakar and Hanafi (2007); Singh and  Singh (2008); Overtoom  (2000); Cassidy 
(2012); Omar, et al. (2012); Tripney et al. ( 2013);  Lippmann ((2015) reported that new knowledge demand by the 
employer of labour due to the advent of technology and globalization and the demand for employability skills in 
contemporary labour market has posed a serious challenges to Nigerian technical education graduates. The 
prevailing unemployment in Nigeria due is to the lack of judicious utilization of resources or preference of priorities 
by leaders (Ayegba 2015), these constitute a major challenges facing the Nigerian technical education graduates, 
these observation prompted scholars to investigate using studies to find an appropriate skills that can develop the 
students’ skills for employment (Ayegba 2015; Ibrahim & ado 2018). 
 
Among the observation is the mismatch between the skills needed and the academic education acquire by the 
graduates’ which bring about the increase of unemployment rate among Nigerian graduates (Kayode and Adeyemi,

Analysis in Table 2 reveals that each of the four competencies had high Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients 
ranged from 0.76-0.89. Also, the reliability coefficient of the entire item was computed to be 0.91 which indicated 
that the test was a refined test in consonance with the recommendation of (Landis & Koch, 1977) which stated that 
acceptable reliability of test or agreement of the raters on test given to trainees/students in education is generally in 
the range of 0.41 to 1.00.  
 
Therefore given the high reliability coefficients or substantial agreement for various competencies in the test, the 
answer to research question about the reliability of the test would be in the affirmative. Thus, the items in the 
emotional intelligence competency were reliable and the result of the test could be considered in the study. 
 
5.2 Summary of factorial validity/analysis emotional intelligence competency needed for 
employability skills of technical education graduates in Nigeria  
The data reveals that 65 items had factor loadings that ranged from 0.405 to 0.859 and were above the factor loading 
of 0.40 at 10% over lapping variance with four components. This indicated that all the 65 items were valid for the 
emotional intelligence competency needed for employability skills of technical education graduates in northern 
Nigeria. In general, all the 65 items are valid enough as the emotional intelligence competency needed for 
employability skills of technical education graduates in Nigeria. This finding agreed with Bakare (2014), Giachino 
and Gallington (1977) that if content has no components of non – loading items, it is assumed that the factorial 
validity of the tasks or content is high. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Unemployment is seen as one of the problems facing Nigerian technical education graduates and this is because 
these graduates were not well trained with emotional intelligence competencies and employability skills. In order to 
respond to these challenges, it is necessary to prepare the graduates with the needed employability skills and abilities 
in 21st century. The authors agreed with finding of Goleman (2011), Goleman et al. (2002) that it is compulsory for 
every graduate and individual worker to possess emotional intelligence competence to enable him/her performance 
effectively to the satisfaction of client and the employer as well.  
 
And also Suarta (2017) that communication skill, problem-solving and decision-making skills, and teamwork skills 
are the attributes of employability skills with highest importance level and that will improve individual chances of 
getting employment.

Abstract 
 
Photography has been part of the human's way of expressing their emotions, feelings, opinions, messages and 
passion to other people as a form of communication. It is a form of art that needed audience for it to be acknowledge 
and it is often exhibited on venues such as museums, exhibits, and public displays for a long time. With the 
existence of internet and social media platforms in the modern era, people have found a way of expressing their 
ideas and work, which includes photography to online platforms. This study is conducted to determine the feasibility 
of a web-based photography website to its setting and to know its needs, approach, benefits and competition. In 
addition to this, this study uses survey questionnaire as the method to determine the strategic approach needed to 
build the suitable marketing strategies for The Block. The researchers used SWOT Analysis and TOWS Analysis 
with the support of the questionnaires classified via 6 thinking hats in order to determine and formulate the strategic 
approach needed by the platform. This study successfully formulated its possible approach in order to improve The 
Block’s competitiveness with its competitors. The researchers found out that they have to deploy some professional 
photographers initially on the website and improve its UI/UX design of its website to attract more users and be more 
known to the public.

1. Introduction 
As a means of visual communication and expression, photography has discrete aesthetic abilities. So as to achieve 
understanding them, you must first understand the component of the way itself. According to Gernsheim H. et al. 
(2020) the most essential elements of the image are usually seen instantly when time of exposure. It is a unique 
characteristic of photography because it stabilizes it separately from the other photo making method. We have 
countless photographs that are being produced every day. Imagine having a 1% of the world population would be 
taking pictures and upload it online there will be a 70 million pictures that will be produced. It cannot handle by a 
few large websites or application if every day we had to experience it. 
 
According to Pogrebin (2020) in the year of 2017 many have realized how much business gone through online 
previews before art fairs. Many museums are closed; art fairs are cancelled due to the pandemic situation. “If 
galleries are closed, how can we sell art? The online platform is something we have envisioned as an important part 
of what we do.” Mr. Zwirner said. This kind of virtual experience would be a huge growth especially for the art and 
photography system. Most of the galleries today are web-based works and curated online exhibitions. 
 
A proposed system, ""The Block” one of the web-based application that enables users to upload photographs to be 
displayed in public. It allows artists or photographers to reach more people using this website. This website allows 
users to upload and view photographs or images in a timeline manner.

Table 2 shows the TOWS Analysis formulated in this study derived from the SWOT analysis presented previously.  
TOWS Analysis aided the researchers in producing the strategies needed to address the weaknesses and threats 
using the strengths and opportunities available to The Block. The strategies that the researchers come up with are the 
following: 
 
Strengths and opportunities – Administering photo submission contests within the platform consistently through the 
platform would attract professional photographers in using The Block regularly.  
 
Strengths and threats – Educating the users about the platform's data privacy and intellectual property management 
through a documentation which is always available. 
 
Weakness and opportunities – Adding interaction modules with like, reaction, comment features for the users to 
prolong their usage of the platform. 
 
Weakness and threats – Building the platform’s unique branding through themed UI and UX design so that it will 
stand out to its fellow competitors in the market. A dedicated mobile app version of The Block can also give a 
competitive edge from its competitors. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The researchers recommended to increase the participants of the survey to gather more opinions with regards to the 
implementation of the platform. It is also beneficial to have user-acceptance testing when the system is fully 
developed to improve the system’s functionality, usability, reliability, maintainability, efficiency and portability. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The methodology used in the span of the conduct of this study helped identify the needed marketing strategies, 
techniques, approaches, and possible solutions for the implementation of The Block. The initial survey assisted the 
researchers determine the feasibility of The Block’s concept and vision to the possible target market and users 
available within the region. From the initial survey conducted, the researchers managed to come up with the 
N.A.B.C Analysis of the project. The researchers determine the need of the people for a platform that allow 
photographers to showcase their work and photo enthusiasts to have a place wherein they can appreciate photos 
without exerting physical efforts in an online environment. Also, the researchers list down the benefits that the 
platform will provide to its users while comparing it to what the existing competitors offer to the market and users. 
 
Having the initial survey completed its analysis, the researchers proceeded to the conduct of the survey 
questionnaires needed to know the future approach of The Block and to know its marketing strategy. The 
researchers discovered that they need to focus in encouraging professional photographers to be pillars of the website 
for The Block to attract customers. In order to do that, The Block should improve its website UI/UX design to 
enhance its user-friendliness. Enhancing the interaction modules of The Block are also needed for the platform and 
internal events such as consistent photography contests would also be beneficial both for the platform and its users. 
Lastly, in order to gain competitive advantage from its competitors, The Block should look forward in building its 
own branding with a dedicated mobile app, logo design, unique theme and design presentation.

Abstract  
This paper discusses the design of a Biodiesel pilot plant that uses waste cooking oil collected from fried food 
retailers to produce biodiesel. Greenhouse gas emissions, land pollution, a bad rural economy, a lack of foreign 
exchange, and unemployment are all issues that have a negative impact on the South African national economy, 
and the machine is designed to address these issues. User-friendly, raw material storage capacity, cost-
effectiveness, and environmental friendliness were all requirements for the designed machine. Three designs of 
the biodiesel pilot plant were generated to reduce the problem by converting the waste cooking into biodiesel. The 
most convenient design was the pilot plant ‘one reactor tank’ since it is cost-efficient due to fewer components 
used when manufacturing. Safety considerations have been integrated with the design to minimise the possible 
risks that may be experienced while using the machine. In the second semester, the supervisor recommended that 
a group design a biodiesel pilot plant to improve on the ones done individually. In theory, the final design is more 
efficient, cost-effective, and simple to construct when compared to the others. The biodiesel pilot plant recycles 
used cooking oil to promote environmental social responsibility as a commodity while also informing the public 
about the importance of renewable energy sources. The model also encourages communities to get involved in 
the recycle economy concept. The machine will reduce the country's dependency on imported fossil fuels while 
also promoting long-term rural development.

1280","6.2.7. Political 
According to South African laws, a licensed petroleum manufacturer may not refuse to buy biodiesel unless it can 
prove that it does not have enough petroleum diesel to handle the level of biodiesel being supplied. All petroleum 
diesel generated by a licensed petroleum manufacturer is destined for a blending facility for this sub-regulation. 
 
7. Conclusions and Future Research 
The project aimed to develop a Biodiesel pilot plant that would generate biodiesel from waste cooking oil collected 
from restaurants and fried food sellers. The machine must be user-friendly, can store raw materials, be cost-
effective, and be environmentally friendly. Three designs of the biodiesel pilot plant were generated to address 
the problem, the more convenient design was the one reactor tank since it is cost-efficient due to fewer components 
used. Safety considerations have been drafted to minimise the possible risks that may be experienced while using 
the machine. The design was based on the standards provided by the South African National Standard (SANS). 
 
The machine's prototype can be constructed so that testing can be run to see if the machine satisfies the aim of 
this project. Methanol is a highly costly fuel, and its price is linked to the change in oil prices. The objective 
should be to create a long-lasting yet low-cost pilot unit by including a methanol recovery phase in a design. The 
recovery is ensured by heating the processor tank to 65°C to ensure that all methanol boils. The evaporated 
methanol is then passed through a condenser before being recovered and reused in the next biofuel production. 
For further optimisation, the simulation may be done with the aid of Autodesk Inventor and ANSYS to test if the 
machine will be able to resist the temperature, pressure, and forces being applied.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to measure the elasticity of labor demand and the level of rigidity of real wages and to study the 
dynamic behavior of sectoral real wages in West Java. The elasticity of demand for labor was analyzed using the OLS 
method, the level of wage rigidity using the Error Correction Model (ECM) and the dynamic behavior of real wages 
using the Impulse Response Function (IRF) method. The results show that the elasticity of demand for labor to real 
wages is inelastic in all sectors. The elasticity of demand for labor on changes in various sources of economic growth 
is also inelastic in all sectors. Employment opportunities in the agricultural and industrial sectors are more responsive 
to increasing exports and investment, while other sectors are more responsive to increasing public consumption. Labor 
productivity and imports significantly reduce employment opportunities in all sectors. Furthermore, the industrial 
sector has real wages that are more rigid than the real wages of the agricultural sector and other sectors. The real wages 
of the industrial sector need time to reach equilibrium, as well as the agricultural sector and other sectors also need 
time to reach the equilibrium level. Increasing the competitiveness of export commodities and creating a conducive 
investment climate are strategic steps to expand job opportunities. In addition, policies such as setting the minimum 
wage that is more in line with market wages are also considered strategic to reduce wage rigidity in West Java Province

Abstract 
This report documents the design of an acoustic horn and development of internet of things (IoT) model for 
acoustic maintenance of boilers. The aim was to design an acoustic horn cleaner which use acoustic energy or 
sound waves to blast off particles build-up from the boiler tubes while the boiler is operating. AutoCAD Invertor 
2021 was used to generate a modelled acoustic horn which was then simulated using real life forces, pressures 
and temperatures encountered in the operation of the boilers. Different sources were also used to develop an 
Internet of Things model. The application of the acoustic cleaner is in a boiler which is a critical environment 
with an approximate pressure of 552 kPa and a maximum temperature of 300 °C. Stress (static ad transient 
dynamic) and thermal analysis simulations were conducted on the critical components of the design using Ansys 
R2 student version. The deflection of the diaphragm was determined under the action of maximum pressure 
supplied by the compressed air to deflect to approximately 0.546 m without restrictions., However, in actual 
sense the Diaphragm deformation is restricted by the Housing and thus, excessive deformation above 100mm of 
the diaphragm is unlikely. The endcap of the housing has a deflection allowance of 80mm which is enough for 
the membrane to vibrate at natural frequency of 75.322 Hz. An IoT model was developed for remote access to 
the developed acoustic cleaning system. The developed IoT boiler maintenance model is also known as a smart 
boiler model.

1. Introduction 
 
Nowadays one of the common ways to generate electricity is by burning of fossil fuels such as coal in order 
to heat steam in boilers at high temperatures to rotate steam turbines thereby producing electricity. This research 
focuses on the maintenance of boilers using an acoustic horn and the development of Internet of Things model for 
boiler maintenance (Shandu and Kallon, 2020a: Shandu et al, 2019). Boiler cleaning plays a very important role 
in increasing the efficiency of a boiler. Improving the efficiency of pulverized coal (PC) fired boilers has been the 
focus of considerable efforts by the utility industry since it leads to several benefits (reduced emissions and 
consumption of coal per MWe). Typically, a one percent improvement in overall efficiency can result in a nearly 
three percent reduction in CO2 emission (Sankar, 2019).  
 
The internet of things (IoT) is now considered a new generation of internet technology. IoT is a system of 
interrelated computing devices that can transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-
to-computer interaction. This research focuses on adopting ways which to use the current internet technology in 
maintaining the boilers. One of the proposed solutions is to install IoT sensors (smart boiler concept) around the

The simulations indicate that the Acoustic horn assembly has an output of 75.322 Hz frequency. The Diaphragm 
that generates this frequency is not subjected to excessive stresses and hence does undergo permanent or excessive 
deformation which will lead to fracture (Shandu and Kallon, 2020b). The diaphragm housing assembly that houses 
the diaphragm restricts the amount of deflection of the diaphragm to 80mm and thus as the diaphragm will be able 
to expand and allow for the evacuation of the pressurized air particles without exceeding deformation of 80mm.

Abstract 
 
An acoustic horn has been developed for Sasol Synfuels in Secunda. It has been concluded that this is the best 
methodology for dislodging ash agglomeration on the boiler tubes, since it can perform this act while boilers are in 
operation, thereby eliminating the need to shut down boilers for cleaning. The acoustic horn utilises sound energy that 
induces vibration and strain on the boiler substructure components. This results in a concern to develop vibration and 
strain sensors in order to measure these phenomena. An accelerometer is considered to monitor vibration signals, 
while a secondary strain-gauge sensor is considered to measure strain signals. The analysis entails a predetermined 
assessment of the suitable sensor parameters for the anticipated input signals. The appropriate accelerometer for this 
kind of application is concluded to be a piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 1000 mV/G as most suitable. 
Furthermore, a strain-gauge sensor of a quarter-bridge type one with a gauge factor of 2 and nominal resistance of 350 
Ω is deemed to be most suitable.

Figure 2 illustrates the chosen strain-gauge circuit configuration. The quarter-bridge type 1 has three bridge 
completion resistors and one strain gauge.  This chosen configuration achieves a sensitivity of 1000 µε at 0.5 mV/V. 
Due to the three bridge completion resistors, there is a single fused gauge into the configuration, thereby utilizing less 
excitation energy. Ultimately, axial and bending strains can be measured through this chosen quarter bride type one 
strain-gauge.

Fundamental sensor parameters were established in order to proceed with design, analysis, and simulation. A 
piezoelectric accelerometer was elected and defined to have a sensitivity of 1000 mV/g for a vibration signal of 0.1 g. 
While the strain-gauge sensor was defined to have a resistance of 350 Ω with a gauge factor of 2. In addition to the 
strain-gauge sensor, a quarter-bridge configuration type I proved to be suitable for development.

Abstract 
 
Acoustics can primarily be defined as the discipline that deals with the creation, reception, transmission, control, and 
properties of sound, where mechanical waves propagate in an elastic medium such as solids, gases, and liquids. Such 
mechanical waves transfer energy from one point to another without inducing permanent displacement on the medium. 
As such, waves do not transfer mass but energy, therefore, mass is only moved perpendicular in the direction of 
propagation. Based on the scientific principles of acoustics technology, many industrial plants have adopted this form 
of technology for internal substructure cleaning methodologies of plant equipment. This form of cleaning 
methodology is known as either acoustic cleaning or sonic cleaning. An acoustic cleaning device is utilized to inhibit 
particulate material accumulation on various plant equipment such as boiler units, ducts, hoppers, and electrostatic 
precipitators. Surface cleanliness is maintained without intrusion into the internal substructure of plant equipment.  
This paper reports on the state or arts in the development of the acoustics cleaning technology.

1. Introduction 
A power plant is an industrial facility that burns fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for the generation of 
electrical power. Moreover, a power plant is also referred to as a power station or powerhouse. A typical power station 
configuration comprises of the following components namely, a generator, steam turbine, condenser, feed water pump, 
and boiler unit(s). The electricity production process commences with pulverized coal fed from a mill into a boiler 
that induces heat and as a result, the coal particles combust and burn to generate heat that converts water into steam 
by means of convection heat transfer. 
The steam generated from the boiler turns the turbine blades at very high speeds, as a result, the turbine rotates the 
rotor encased in a stator (these are the sub-components that make up the generator). Ultimately, the generator produces 
an electric current, which is transmitted to end users such as industrial areas and households via power lines, Figure

1304","and particulate matter accumulation in “blind spots” where conventional cleaning devices such as rapping systems 
and soot blowers are often ineffective (Power Engineering, 1999). 
Sonic cleaning devices typically operate in one of two acoustic environments: audible and infrasonic. In general, as 
the frequency decreases, the effective power level increases. Audible acoustic/sonic horns maintain frequencies above 
about 75 Hz so that the natural harmonic frequency of surrounding plant equipment is not reached, which can 
potentially lead to equipment damage. Infrasonic devices operate at ultralow frequencies, between about 10 and 35 
Hz, creating intense gas-stream turbulence that keeps affected surfaces clean. There are some concerns that infrasonic 
devices, because of their low frequency range, are more likely to damage surrounding equipment. Flat, unsupported 
surfaces such as ductwork can be more susceptible to induced vibration. Through proper design and engineering, 
however, infrasonic cleaning can be very effective (Power Engineering, 1999). 
The acoustic horn’s ability to eradicate particulate matter accumulation depends on its sound vibration force, which 
is generally known as the sound pressure level (measured in dB). In order to fluidize particulate matter accumulation, 
the sound pressure level should be greater than 120 dB. The greater the sound vibration force, the more effective the 
particulate matter removal is attained. The acoustic horn’s operating sound frequency is characteristically between 
125 and 250 Hz. Normally, frequencies greater than 250 Hz are more perceptible and are highly probable to irritate 
nearby plant personnel. However, this does not suggest that lower frequencies are preferable. In actual fact, sound 
pressure levels at frequencies below 60 Hz lose their capability of removing particulate material, while also having 
the potential of damaging solid structures, such as feeders, silo walls, mechanical connections, dischargers, and 
support legs (Smith, 2008). 
As explained, acoustic energy requires to be monitored and regulated in order to warrant the production of low 
frequencies are not reached since they pose an undesirable consequence of damaging nearby surrounding objects. This 
possible structural integrity compromise is a result of vibration of kinetic energy (sound waves) that induce vibration 
on nearby surrounding objects. 
3. Conclusion 
The term acoustics in itself has a broad meaning whereby it is applicable in various fields such as music, architectural 
spaces, and ultrasound medical imaging just to name a few. It has been demonstrated that sound is a form of energy 
that creates atmospheric pressure fluctuations generated by turbulent fluid flow and vibrating surfaces. A device that 
utilizes this phenomenon is an acoustic horn, that generates sound energy to inhibit ash and particulate material 
accumulation on various equipment such as hoppers, ducts, and boiler units. One of the benefits of using acoustic 
energy is that none intrusive cleaning of the plant’s internal substructure apparatus can be attained. The nature of 
sound propagation induces vibration on surrounding objects, such that if not monitored and controlled, the device may 
have detrimental effects on plant equipment (Mhlongo and Kallon, 2021).

Abstract 
 
Process deterioration is a leading cause of mediocre production plan adherence and hence not satisfying customers' 
demand. Process setup and quality improvement are two common factors that return the production system to its 
designated status. The proposed research integrates production control, capital investment, and quality control 
aspects to enhance the reliability and productivity of the production-inventory system. To achieve this goal, a 
mathematical model is formulated to decide the optimal production run length (OPRL), cost of setup, and cost of 
process quality improvement. It is assumed that the production process starts in an in-control state with a fixed 
defective rate and may shift to an out-of-control state with a linear increase of defective rate. A numerical example 
is provided to demonstrate model practicability and to derive managerial insights. For instance, investment in setup 
cost reduction and quality improvement can achieve a 61.07% reduction in the total cost.

1. Introduction 
In today's highly competitive world markets, businesses need to employ a cost-effective production-inventory policy 
to meet customer demand. The optimal production run length (OPRL) model is an extension of the Economic Order 
Quantity (EOQ) and Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) models. The classical OPRL is one of the most popular 
and appealing issues of production-inventory system management. The run length of the production is determined 
economically to minimize the total inventory and production costs by balancing the inventory holding cost and the 
average fixed ordering cost. Many models with more complicated and/or practical assumptions, on the other hand, 
have been thoroughly investigated in recent years. Furthermore, the OPRL model has had limitations over the years 
and cannot be considered a universal model (Chiu et al., 2010; Taleizadeh et al., 2014), as many key assumptions of 
the classical OPRL model relax factors that are inevitable in many manufacturing systems. 
 
The classical OPRL model assumes that the production process starts in an in-control state, and the status may 
change after an uncertain time to an out-of-control state. It is assumed that no defective parts are produced during 
the in-control state, and all produced items are of perfect quality, i.e., the system is failure-free. Although in the real 
production systems, quality is not at zero-level defective during the in-control period. Different policies are adopted 
in the industry, e.g., discard, repair or rework, to deal with the defective items based on the item type and degree of 
imperfectness. Moreover, quality has a considerable share of the total cost. Therefore, the inventory management 
plan proposed by the traditional model might be inappropriate (Hou, 2007). 
 
Although several research studies have modeled the production-inventory system, they have ignored the effect of 
investment in quality improvement on the system's performance and reliability. This research contributes to the 
literature by incorporating various aspects, such as the deterioration of the production process, investment in quality 
improvement during the in- and out-of-control periods, and investment in setup-cost reduction. The process has a 
constant defective rate during the in-control period, and as the shift occurs, the process deterioration begins to 
increase to the end of the cycle.

The proposed model considers the defective rate during both in- and out-of-control states. As expected, the 
production run length is longer in the proposed model than in the (Hou, 2007) model. Longer t* to compensate for 
the defective parts and saving in TAC is realized by reducing the required investments in setup cost reduction and 
quality improvement. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The proposed model computes the OPRL, setup cost, and process quality. The production process starts in an in-
control state and may shift to an out-of-control state after an elapsed time. The time to the shift is assumed to be 
exponentially distributed. After the shift, the process became out-of-control, and the deterioration increases linearly 
to the end of the production cycle. Defective items are produced at a constant rate during in-control; this rate 
increases linearly after the shift due to process deterioration. The results from the proposed model show a direct 
relationship between investment in setup cost reduction and OPRL, whereas an inverse relationship exists between 
investments in-process quality and OPRL. The OPRL depends on a, b, and c, representing how costly it is to reduce 
setup cost and how costly it is to make process quality improvement. Since an increase or a reduction in OPRL 
affects the produced quantity and hence the inventory level and shortage, it is important to investigate the optimal 
allocation of investments among different options. As future work considers the deterioration during the out-of-
control state increases exponentially and integrates maintenance planning to restore the process to its original 
condition, i.e., in-control state.

1. Introduction  
Even as technology astounds us, it is also becoming more competitive in its mesmerizing creativity. Technology 
and development are relevant to people from all walks of life, and their rising relevance in our everyday lives has 
made it necessary for the realms of business and industry to evolve in tandem with technological advancements. 
To achieve success and relevance, every organization or corporation must adapt digitally, and they must do so on 
an ongoing basis to stay ahead of the competition. The study of organizational transformation is considered one 
of the most significant studies about the sustainability of a business. The studies that several researchers have 
conducted show that organizational transformation is considered very important because it can generate a 
competitive advantage. Porras and Silvers (1991) state that organizational transformation can occur when a 
change in the business environment is considered very relevant by the business. Thus, when a business is 
stimulated by its surroundings to make changes, it will directly impact business continuity. Essentially, corporate 
transformation is the process of radically altering how all people in a company perceive, think, and conduct to 
serve better a broader range of requirements from a more significant number of critical stakeholders over a 
longer length of time. 
 
An organization that plans change should ideally pay attention to its supporting components. According to 
Porras and Silvers (1991), there are four components in change that have a relationship with each other, namely 
1) intervening change, (2) then, related to variables that support organizational goals, (3) seeing the individual as 
an essential part of the organization's goals. Organization and, therefore, individual behavior in the workplace 
support change efforts, and finally (4) looks at the impact of change on the organization (Porras and Silvers, 
1991). Mckinsey conducted a study in 2009, asking CEOs from throughout the globe about their recent 
organizational transformation experiences. These modifications served a variety of purposes. Some were 
offensive in nature, such as going from excellent to exceptional performance or geographical expansion; others 
were defensive, such as cost reduction or crisis management. Some, for example, merger integration and 
privatization readiness—did not fit well into either group. Slightly more than a third of all respondents said that 
their organizations were excellent or effective at achieving their objectives (Isern et al, 2009).

1336","versus quantum shifts (or firm transformations), are considered the distinguishing and most critical element 
between the two types of shifts (Beugelsdijk, Siangen, and Herpen, van, 2002). Every business, regardless of 
size or industry, needs digital Transformation. When a shift occurs within the organization, individual readiness 
is required so that individual characteristics, such as digital orientation, are considered relevant to 
Transformation and within the organization, can affect employees' digital competence. The importance of 
individual characteristics, such as digital orientation, will encourage the need to provide access to information 
technology training, managerial assistance, and digital infrastructure (Aboelmaged & Subbaugh, 2012). As 
businesses seek to rely on digital technology to simplify existing work, there is hope that digital technology will 
also bring future success. In contrast to previous studies on digital orientation at the organizational level 
conducted at the individual level, the digital orientation of workers influences employee productivity (Khin & 
Ho, 2018). 
 
On the other hand, employees must try to be tied to work to have priorities and be dedicated (Markos and 
Sridevi, 2010). On the other hand, various studies show that those who are fully absorbed in their work have 
better levels of job involvement and emotional productivity (Abraham, 2012 Shuck, et al. 2011). Described by 
Harpaz and Snir (2014) as a high level of interest in one's work which is manifested through the emotions of joy, 
challenge, and importance, employee engagement can be defined as follows: Previous studies have shown that a 
high level of job involvement, which consists of components such as vitality, devotion, and absorption, have a 
considerable beneficial impact on employee productivity (Hanaysha, 2015). According to many studies, 
employee engagement is a construct consisting of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral traits related to employee 
role performance (Shuck et al., 2011). It shows the commitment and interest of workers towards their work, and 
it is designed to improve the company's overall performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study indicates that in the banking environment, there are the following phenomena: digital capability 
affects employee productivity positively, digital capability affects corporate transformation readiness positively, 
employee engagement affects employee productivity positively, and employee engagement affects corporate 
transformation readiness positively. This study certainly needs to be strengthened by confirmation of secondary 
data that can show that employee productivity among employees in banking is indeed affected by employee 
engagement; this can be obtained through confirmation to employees who have characteristics between 31 and 
40 years of age and have worked between 5 years up to 10 years.

Abstract 
 
Telehealth and Telemedicine have become topics of great interest in this digital age, especially after the global 
outbreak of COVID-19. Medical personnel and individuals seeking healthcare require a means to bridge the gap 
created by inaccessibility and inability to conduct in-person visits in order to deliver efficient health services. 
Unfortunately, there still lies a challenge in fully incorporating this technology due to asymmetry among the healthcare 
providers, hospitals, and the user-ends, especially in developing countries. This paper explores services that can be 
rendered under telehealth; methods in which telemedicine can be integrated into the contemporary healthcare system; 
the advantages and possibilities that come with technology as well as the inefficiencies and limitations currently being 
faced, how these problems can be resolved; and the future of telehealth/telemedicine.”

1. Introduction 
Telehealth is the provision of health care services by all medical practitioners employing information and 
communications technology for the exchange of reliable information for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 
diseases and injuries. Its applications extend to monitoring and assessment, and continuance education of healthcare 
professionals, all within the objectives of promoting the health of individuals and their community at large, where 
distance is a crucial element (Cook, 2012). Telemedicine is the process of distributing medical care to patients across 
a long distance. Medical information could be sent using smoke signals and light reflection, such as signalling plague 
outbreaks, alerting births, deaths, and the occurrence of an event. Through advancements such as the invention of 
printing, the telephone, and the Internet, medical information sharing, and telemedicine have advanced in recent years. 
Using ""live-chats,"" drones to observe environmental hazards, and video conferencing, health care providers may now 
give healthcare directly to patients within the comfort of their own homes.

1347",,"on the affected person end. For decades, telehealth has been getting numerous interest withinside the clinical sector. 
Telemedicine is the act of supplying hospital treatment to sufferers throughout a protracted distance. Telehealth has 
the cap potential to deal with an extensive variety of troubles in today`s healthcare via way or means of decorating the 
effectiveness, accessibility, utilization, performance, and efficacy of care even as additionally reducing expenses and 
making it extra accessible. Its fulfilment is inspired via several elements, which include era challenges, infrastructure, 
law, extrude management, and economic enterprise models. Numerous adjustments arise over the years in fitness care, 
and those adjustments will retain at a fast pace, necessitating even extra training. Nevertheless, with this era comes a 
slew of latest issues, which includes maintaining up with today's technologies, exercising at a quicker rate, and so on. 
Even though the bulk of human beings make use of the era and take advantage of it, there are hurdles alongside the 
way, which include the want for skilled people to perform devices, the value of servicing, and so on. It's essential to 
hold in thoughts that many medical ailments necessitate bodily exams or treatments, and that being concerned is a 
humanistic and relational activity. The COVID-19 outbreak provides a treasured danger to construct state-of-the-art 
telehealth answers which have the potential to revolutionize clinical offerings and human beings’ lives each regionally 
and globally. Telemedicine permits sufferers to speak with their doctors through video or phone, which is fine for 
their fitness in addition to their convenience. Patients are more and more being allowed to ""see"" their doctors through 
pc or smartphone. Because of technological advancements, telemedicine has ended up tons extra accessible, even to 
folks who are not pc savvy. Telemedicine minimizes the want to go back and forth to a medical institution or clinic, 
park, walk, or take a seat down in a ready vicinity whilst you are ill. You can be trying to find a clinical 
recommendation from the benefit of your very own home. To help withstand the prevention and unfold of COVID-
19, flu, in addition to different infectious diseases, docs can use telehealth meetings to pre-display sufferers for feasible 
infectious disease. It additionally minimizes the want for ill human beings to return to work.  
 
Telemedicine may also help a few specialized practitioners as it permits them to peer you withinside the consolation 
of your very own home. Allergists, for instance, can be capable of discovering allergy-inflicting triggers for your 
environment. To shield your circle of relatives’ fitness, seek advice from a number one care practitioner on an ordinary 
basis, which includes one that focuses on own circle of relatives’ medicine, inner medicine, or pediatrics. Telemedicine 
makes it simpler to talk with a physician or nurse practitioner. The emergence of telemedicine is one of the few 
blessings of the COVID-19 pandemic (Barney, Buckelew, Mesheriakova, & Raymond-Flesch (2020). Telehealth 
gives the cap-potential to address an extensive variety of problems in today`s contemporary-day healthcare via way 
of means of fine improvement, accessibility, utilization, productivity, and effectiveness of care even as slicing 
expenses and growing performance to make it extra accessible. One of the important thing issues amongst fitness-care 
employees could be that the affected person-company courting may also deteriorate. 
 
To gather a truthful understanding of the existing kingdom of telemedicine carrier provision, 4 of the maximum 
famous and well-mounted telemedicine sectors have been explicitly explored. Among the fields are teleradiology, 
telepathology, teledermatology, in addition to telepsychiatry. Among the 4 telemedicine specialties analyzed, 
teleradiology has the nice danger of growing a carrier supply.

1. Introduction 
A popular definition of sustainability dates from a study published by the Brundtland Commission of the United 
Nations, which defined sustainable development as solutions to achieve current requirements without jeopardizing 
future generations' ability to satisfy stated or implied needs (UNBC, 2020). For present and future generations, 
sustainability is and will be a critical problem. The common perception that natural resources are limitless, and that 
the environment's regenerative potential can compensate for all human activity is no longer accurate. As a result,

In summary, sustainable manufacturing ensures that the product being manufactured is not of harm to the 
environment or consumer. The research covers how artificial intelligence and ICT can be used to ensure the most 
efficient result in various manufacturing procedures stretching from quality control to supply chain management.   
A few companies which have used artificial intelligence in the manufacturing process are seen to have consistent 
revenue growth which proves sustainable manufacturing because if the products were not being manufactured to 
consumer quality, there would be a decrease in the demand and therefore negative revenue values. Thus, Artificial 
intelligence is necessary and effective in sustainable manufacturing.

Abstract 
 
In recent years, maintenance activities have become more complex along with the trends of automation in various 
industries. It implies maintenance being a dependent factor to service quality, one of which is urban rail 
transportation that already adhered to the grade of automation. In addition to its complexity, maintenance is also a 
major contributor in the cost-of-service delivery, reaching 15% of the total operating costs for urban rail services in 
Indonesia. Maintenance itself was a risk-based business process considering potential failures of technical 
equipment that affect equipment availability or service revenue indirectly. Previous studies recognized that the 
increased expectation of service quality and risk of maintenance activities are still linear to maintenance costs. 
Furthermore. most companies only follow OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) rather than develop their own 
strategy. Several studies have been conducted to determine maintenance strategies but have not considered the 
quality and risk of failure comprehensively. Therefore, this study aims to design a model of determining 
maintenance policies through priority arrangement of maintenance activities based on the risk of failure and its 
impact on service quality. Data are obtained from service quality attributes survey and stakeholder interview of 
urban rail company. Using House of Quality (HoQ) the importance of each maintenance activity is identified and 
prioritized subsequently based on potential failure and detection capabilities using FMEA (Failure Mode Effect 
Analysis). The result shows priority indexing on each maintenance activity. Afterwards those priority can be utilized 
as the main criteria for determining maintenance and inventory policy.

1. Introduction 
Maintenance has been played a critical role for most of industries in terms of quality assurance and process 
efficiency through the availability of machine during production or service operation (Glawar et al., 2016). 
Equipment availability becomes the main objectives of maintenance activities so that service level or product quality 
can be managed. It may cause a great damage on the business continuity, included for transportation sector 
especially the one adopted automation in Their operation. Once the fleet of vehicles or critical subsystem is 
experiencing problems and cannot be operated, then transportation services cannot take place so that there is a 
blocked for creating revenue. Furthermore, there is an indirect impact also of potential customer satisfaction aspects 
on future revenue (Jiang and Murthy, 2008). Besides the positive impact, it has cost should be borne by the company 
which calculated almost 15-40% of operation cost (Mobley, 1990). Looking at rail-transport industry in Indonesia, 
maintenance activities burden 15% of the total operating and maintenance costs. It was significantly great compared 
to other transport operators in Asia such as Bangkok and Delhi, the proportion of maintenance costs required only 
1% and 3% (Nurcahyo et al., 2020). 
 
The challenge of maintenance strategy is how control equipment deterioration with the least total cost as well as 
ensuring safe and environmentally friendly operation (Golonka and Brennan, 1996). Notwithstanding the 
importance of maintenance strategy was, it receives inconsiderable attentions from the top management. In general, 
companies only follow guidance from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) (Jiang and Murthy, 2008). In 
the recent years, the complexity of maintenance activities also increases following the growth of automation 
transformation. This also applies to the rail-based transportation. Rail transportation is a growing sector and a 
strategic project in Indonesia. In their research, Hakim and Kartikoseno (2018) through the Kano integration model

cleanliness, there has no system to detect the failure. Only rely on the supervision from the station officers which 
regularly going around to observe station condition. 
 
Based on the priority, the most advanced maintenance policy should be adopted by the “very hight priority” because 
it already considered risk and the cost damage may be caused if the system failed to operate. As mentioned in 
research from Glawar et al., 2016, maintenance policy generally classified into 4 terms, Corrective Maintenance 
(CM), Preventive Maintenance (PM), Condition Based Maintenance (CBM), and Anticipated Maintenance (AM). 
The first three also being metioned by (Velmurugan and Dhingra, 2015) to develop their conceptual framework of 
maintenance selection. Result from the Analytical Hierarchy Process and Goal Programing of the maintenance 
policy options, Arunraj and Maiti, 2010, explain that CBM was appropriate the most to system with highest critical 
risk consideration. Preventive Maintenance, Corrective Maintenance, and Shutdown Maintenance are considered for 
the lower priority risk respectively (Arunraj and Maiti, 2010). Therefore, for each subsystem, maintenance policy 
recommended as describe in Table 9. Company may reallocate the maintenance budget over the whole system by 
investing or rearrange the number of personnel from one system to another. This classification also need to be 
followed by the spart parts inventory policy for each subsystem.

6. Conclusions and Future Research 
Throughout this study, maintenance policy has been selected by consideration to service quality and failure risk of 
the system. By using two phases of QFD and FMEA principle comprehensively, maintenance policies can be 
derived as priority basis so that company may not be burdensome of the maintenance cost. Using this scheme also 
can be increased the accuracy of “severity” when analyzing risk using FMEA. Priorities also made by considering 
the technical capability in terms of detecting the failure. When the system as is has already been adopted advanced 
monitoring or inspection equipment so that the number of detectability rating can be decreased as well as the risk 
priority number. However, this framework already consume time to calculate and gather the responses of technical 
rating. It will be great if there is automated model which can be used regularly and also to monitor the ‘probability 
of occurrence’ which may be changed over the time being.

Abstract  
 
A chatbot is the most recent application which can optimize service distribution to the customer by minimizing the 
communication with live human agents in the first level. Chatbot’s conversation could be applied via text or text-to-
speech or voice. The marketplace growth itself is mounting in past years. The main purpose of this paper is to 
consider the best chatbot platform using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) combined with Technique for Order of 
Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods for the marketplace in Indonesia. Thus, the 
marketplace could gain a competitive advantage and achieve customer satisfaction with responsive service delivery 
supported by a selected chatbot platform.

1. Introduction  
In 1950 Alan Turing published a paper entitled Computing and Machinery Intelligence which examined the 
interaction between humans and computers where the Turing test tested three objects, one of which was a human 
being able to communicate with two other objects in the form of machines through text media. Alan Turing himself 
is known as the originator of the first digital computer and artificial intelligence as evidenced by his involvement in 
breaking the German Enigma code in the second world war using the help of machine translator, Bombe. 
 
Artificial intelligence combined with language studies is a research that began to be noticed at the beginning of the 
21st century that can be useful for various industries (Kibble, 2013). According to Davenport et al., (2020) artificial 
intelligence can help the sales department in terms of communicating in real time in the future so that it can analyze 
customer complaints through customer voices and find advanced solutions with the help of the sales department who 
is a real human. This can also overcome the limitations of human resources available in a company. On the other 
hand, artificial intelligence can also be a threat because it can cancel some human works in the service process 
(Huang & Rust, 2018) 
 
Hodgkin & Huxley (1952)  researched the interaction of neurons in the human brain with electromagnetic waves 
which ultimately helped in the development of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and artificial intelligence 
(Foote, 2021). Artificial intelligence has broad advantages in adding value to a business (Enholm et al., 2021). The 
combination of NLP algorithms on chatterbots or better known as chatbots can make it easier to recognize and 
respond to an appropriate word in response to questions posed by customers. Without NLP support, chatbots can 
respond to words only based on input from the user's text, so platforms supporting chatbots are important to consider 
only. The chatbot itself began to be widely known around 1966 under the name ELIZA (ZEMČÍK, 2019). 
 
Chatbots can connect customers and customer support services indirectly without interacting with humans at an 
initial level with the support of artificial intelligence that is responded to via text, images and sound. Thus, repetitive 
questions from customers will be easily responded by the machine as quick as possible (Chung et al., 2020). 
However, human interaction is limited in terms of advanced information exchange and there is a possibility of 
failure in service distribution in the use of service-based artificial intelligence (Um et al., 2020). 
 
In addition, according to (Adam et al., 2021), chatbot software is able to save costs and time, however, customer 
dissatisfaction responses are still visible where users still do not comply with requests made by chatbots. Research

Nowadays, Chatbot is the  is the most recent application which can optimize service distribution to the customer by 
minimizing the communication with live human agents in the first level. However, the distribution service can be 
distracted by the slow response from the marketplace without supported by advanced application. To achieve 
customer satisfaction, a company must to consider a helpful application such as Chatbot. Based on analysis 
conducted by using the AHP and TOPSIS techniques, it can be concluded that the best platform of Chatbot is 
Botsify with the first rank is Botsify, the second is ManyChat and the last is Chatfuel, these platforms defined as per 
justification interview with Chatbot expertise. The study hopefully could gain a competitive advantage and achieve 
customer satisfaction with responsive service delivery supported by a selected chatbot platform especially for 
marketplaces in Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
Root cause analysis of two years breakdown data of a Beverage Company in Nigeria reviews that man and method 
are the predominant cause of failures in a production system. This further relates to the competence of maintenance 
personnel. This study adopts a method based on the implementation of the American Society of Mechanical 
Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section XI Appendix VIII) (Boiler and Committee, 1962) 
integrated to a delay time model to analyze and predict the expected downtime from different technicians based on 
capability.  As a large series of tests was not feasible, a smaller “weed out” 8/10 test was designed using binomial 
power curves to determine the probability of perfect inspection (PPI). Numerical analysis shows that as the 
competence of a technician drops, there is a disproportionate increase in the proportion of downtime.  For a given 
cycle of 24 hours, when an inspection is been carried out by a technician with a probability of detection (POD) of 
0.8, the expected downtime is 1.8 hours. When this activity is performed by another with a POD of 0.65, the 
expected downtime is 4.2 hours. There is about a 56% increase in the proportion of downtime compared with the 
corresponding 24%   difference in POD score.

1. Introduction 
In theory, maintenance management could have benefited from the advent of this large area of operations research 
known as maintenance optimization modelling. A maintenance optimization model is essentially a mathematical 
model that quantifies both the costs and benefits of maintenance and finds the best balance between the two while 
accounting for all types of constraints.  
Generally, maintenance optimization models address four issues: 
i. 
description of a technical system, its function, and its significance, 
ii. 
modelling of the system's deterioration over time and possible consequences for the system,  
iii. 
description of the available information about the system and the management actions, and 
iv. 
an objective function and an optimization technique that aids in finding the best balance. 
In literature, a large number of maintenance optimization models are developed and thus, the following questions 
arise. First and foremost, what is the value of maintenance optimization models in terms of maintenance 
management? How frequently and in what context have these models been successfully applied? For the few 
adopted strategies, why do they not give the expected result as production systems that have benefited from the 
models are still being threatened by a large amount of unplanned downtime from breakdown. These questions are 
mostly considered as a pitfall on the usefulness of optimization models, research into an organization maintenance 
system reviewed that in reality, there is a gap in understanding of the impact of maintenance optimization variables 
on the actual result expected from optimization models. Some of the variables are greatly influenced by the 
maintenance personnel carrying out the maintenance activity.  
This work aims to model the predominant elements affecting the effective application of maintenance policies based 
on the root cause of failure analysis and evaluate the impact on the output of the production system in terms of 
downtime proportion.

5.4 Discussion of Results 
From the analysis of the major breakdowns in the plant illustrated in Table 1, man and method are the cuprites. 
Graphical illustration in Figure 1 reviewed that 95 per cent of the total downtime was due to man and method 
problems. Both factors are a function of the functional competency of the maintenance team in applying a prescribed 
maintenance approach. The skill audit template in Table 2 was used to rank the performance of technicians against 
the required skill set for a defined maintenance system. The performance does during the audit does not completely 
replicate field performance hence the ASME code was applied as a weed system to ensure that only capable 
personnel are allowed to carry out maintenance activities. It also helps in mapping out strategic skill upgrades to 
build the required skill set for a defined maintenance policy and system. The 8/10 test power curve in Figure 3 and 
Table 3 showed that a poor performance during the evaluation will have the worst impact in the field according to 
the corresponding PPI. 
  
Using the delay time model, the competency factor was used to estimate the expected downtime from the production 
system. The result shows the impacts a maintenance technician has in generating downtime from imperfect 
inspection and repair as illustrated in Figure 4. Table 4 shows that as the competence of a technician drops, there is 
an increase in the proportion of downtime.  For a given cycle of 24 hours, when an inspection is been carried out by 
Jude Eze with PPI = 0.8455 ,  the expected downtime is 0.07578 × 24 = 1.8 hours . When this activity is 
performed by Adamu Zakari with PPI = 0.2616,  the expected downtime is 0.1734 × 24 = 4.2 hours. There is 
about a 56% increase in the proportion of downtime being experienced when the maintenance task is performed by 
Adamu Zakari. Comparing their corresponding POD scores, Jude Eze only seems to have performed 24% better 
than Adam Zakari. The small difference in POD score was elaborated by the ASME power curve and the effect was 
made obvious by the delay time model. This is very important because the skill and knowledge gap can lead to a 
tremendous increase in downtime in a production environment. Once a production system is set up, the management 
should focus on the skill of the workforce to sustain the equipment at desired reliability. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Analyses of breakdown data without understanding the underlying failure mechanisms will lead to a wrong 
conclusion and subsequent recurrence of failure. From the study, over 90 per cent of downtime experienced during 
production was attributed to either man or method. Man and method issues are functions of skill of the workforce. 
The performance of a technician during evaluation does not exactly represent field performance. The ASME 
standard performance evaluation was used to determine the corresponding probability of perfect inspection of a 
technician based on the obtained performance demonstration score. A delay time model was used to account for the 
effect of competency levels on machine failure, leading to significant downtime.  From the case study, as the 
competency of a technician increases, the probability of missing defects during inspection decreases and also the 
number of defects leading to breakdown is reduced. The competency of a technician also affects the time to repair a 
fault and the overall maintenance integrity. To maintain a certain threshold of downtime, it is paramount to focus on

techniques and the desired results.

Abstract  
 
The dilemmatic condition between economic benefits, environmental drawbacks, and social dependency aspects of 
electronic waste (e-waste) rapid growth requires immediate attention and right policy structurization from the 
Indonesian government. Currently, regulations in Indonesia regarding the management of e-waste have only covered 
the collection procedures for the Municipal Environmental Service (DLH) and the recycling procedure for the third-
party recycler. Meanwhile, the regulation regarding the various financial and material responsibilities between actors 
is still in the form of advisory. This paper provides a conceptual model that structures the current e-waste 
management system and the proposed funding scheme policy. Later, the model understanding of the current actors’ 
relationship, factors dynamics, and the feasible policy is validated and evaluated by three stakeholders in the system. 
From these findings, policymakers could use such alternative schemes to improve the nation’s waste management.

1. Introduction  
Electronic waste (e-waste) has become a complex issue in many developing countries since it contains valuable yet 
hazardous materials that could affect the countries positively and negatively. As the fourth largest e-waste producer 
in Asia, Indonesia could obtain an economic benefit of  US$ 1,8 million in 2020 from the precious metal recycled 
(Forti et al. 2020; Mairizal et al. 2021). From an environmental perspective, every ton of e-waste recycled equals 
1400 tons of carbon emission reduction (Gu et al. 2017). However, the unregulated recycling activity domination in 
a developing country might cause environmental pollution via illegal waste dumping or process leakage (Ahirwar 
and Tripathi 2021). Recycling enterprises in that developing system might also have to raise their buying price since 
users still consider e-waste as precious goods  (Zhang et al. 2020). 
 
The Indonesian government has issued several hazardous waste policies to regulate the e-waste collection center 
facility and recycler’s waste treatment procedure  (Government of Indonesia 2020; Government of Indonesia 2021). 
To support these policies’ implementation, the government also advises producers to take back their obsolete 
products from the customers to be recycled with their third-party recycler or with the municipal recycler. However, 
this extended producer responsibility (EPR) advisory put a new burden on producers’ cost management, so the 
producers demand users to take responsibility for their waste and the government to provide robust infrastructures 
(DITJEN PSLB3 KLHK 2021). Therefore, a study on e-waste management and the proposed funding scheme to 
support this policy advisory design becomes relevant. 
 
Several e-waste funding schemes studies in Indonesia have already focused on a linear relationship between several 
systems’ variables (Ambarwati and Ardi 2019; Yunita et al. 2019). However, e-waste management exists in a 
complex and dynamic system (Hutami et al. 2020). That means studies have to acknowledge the nonlinearity of the 
stakeholder’s dynamic and behavior over time before adopting the appropriate funding scheme policy. Researchers 
and policymakers must also have a complete understanding of several funding policy alternatives from mature 
countries. Otherwise, an unfit funding system that fails to internalize the system’s externalities can burden the 
government financially (Chen et al. 2020; Gu et al. 2017). For this gap, this paper provides a conceptual model to

1402","demand. Ardi and Leisten (2016) and Liu et al. (2021) inspired the causal model research in a developing country. 
Based on the interview and validation with DLH and recycler, only communal stakeholders' agreement can 
determine these funding tariffs amount and implementation. Because stakeholders in Figure 1 directly affect the 
product demand, regulation, infrastructure development, and the e-waste collection and recycling process 
(Ambarwati and Ardi 2019).   
 
5. Conclusion  
This study aims to conceptualize the Indonesian e-waste management system and the developed funding scheme for 
funding policy structurization. The model provides a qualitative causal analysis of loops and links between variables 
in the system. The model is discussed with three stakeholders and finely tuned to their approval. The proposed 
model shows that the deposit-refund scheme managed by BPDLH and funded by tax or advance fees can help 
KLHK goals reduce hazardous waste exposure. The deposit-refund scheme finding is consistent with Damanhuri et 
al. (2019) financial policy recommendation for Indonesia’s e-waste management system. Nevertheless, the clear 
causality between BPDLH and several economic instruments provides a novel and valid logic for future e-waste 
policy.  
 
However, the valid conceptual model is only the fundamental step in understanding the e-waste management 
system's complexity and its potential funding scheme. Further research can be done quantitatively via system 
dynamic simulation modeling to test different scenarios (i.e., funding scheme, tariff, and social tension) with more 
relevant data. Within that approach, policymakers can measure the system’s behavior effect and determine the 
optimal funding scheme.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study was to determine the income and financial viability of the Crispy mushroom industry in 
Indonesia for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs). As indicators, four techniques are used: revenue/cost 
(R/C), benefit cost (B/C), return on investment (ROI), and break event point (BEP). Investment appraisal is used to 
establish whether a financial part of the transaction is possible, based on measurements against stated criteria. The 
evaluation technique offers several advantages and downsides. As a result, it is preferable to employ multiple 
methodologies simultaneously when evaluating a business to acquire the best results. It begins by calculating the 
entire revenue, which comes to 1.64. The total income and total manufacturing expenses exceed zero, resulting in a 
profit of Rp. 64. Return on Investment (ROI) can be defined as the ratio of net profit to costs in each business, which 
in this example is 64%. Break Event Point has two searches, one in rupiah and one in number of productions, and in 
this study, the results of the Break Event Point are 36 pcs, which means that if the Crispy Mushroom produces less 
than that amount from the total quantity of production, the business will be concerned about cost loss.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia is an agrarian country, where most of the people from all walks of life still make a living as farmers 
(Nurilla et al, 2013). The agro-industry sector is a big business opportunity currently in the Indonesian agricultural 
sector, one of which is quite popular is mushroom products (Fatria, 2017). This business opportunity in the 
agroindustry with mushroom products is a promising business, so there are not many business sectors for processed 
mushroom products, especially in the city of Pekanbaru. This research was conducted in one of the SMEs named 
Crispy Mushroom Business which is located on Jl. HR. Soebrantas, Panam, Km 15. Table 1. Sales Data for Crispy 
Mushrooms.

Break Event Point is also included in the series or stages of business feasibility analysis, Break Event Point is a 
search where a business finds a break-even point. In the search, the Break Event Point has two searches, namely in 
the form of rupiah and in the form of units, where in this study the results of the Break Event Point in units are 36 
units, so if the Crispy Mushroom SMEs produces less than that amount from the total amount of production, the 
business will worry about losing. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of calculations on the data that has been collected starting from the cost of equipment, then the 
cost of raw materials, packaging costs and labor costs, into fixed costs and variable costs, the gross income from the 
crispy mushroom business is Rp. 10,500,000 and a net income of Rp. 4,115,000. When viewed financially, this 
crispy mushroom business can also be said to be feasible to carry out or continue, because from the results of 
Revenue/Cost (R/C) the value is 1.64 > 1, then the result of Benefit/Cost (B/C) is obtained the value 0.64 > 0, then 
the Return Of Investment (ROI) value is 64%, and finally the Break Event Point (BEP) is 36 units.

Abstract 
 
The plastic packaging manufacturing industry is a downstream industrial sector, so far it has become the supply 
chain of customer products, especially being part of the food industry, pharmaceutical industry, cosmetics, and 
medical devices. With the increasing demand for plastic packaging, industry players are required to maintain the 
productivity and quality of the products they produce. In order to maintain product performance, control over the 
production process must be carried out, including maintaining engine performance. The effectiveness for measuring 
the performance of production machines is the OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) indicator. The OEE value is 
influenced by 3 variables, namely availability, performance, and quality. These variables are translated into six big 
losses which consist of breakdown losses, set up and adjustment, start-up, idle and minor stoppage, speed losses, and 
defect losses. The purpose of this research is to analyze six big losses on blow molding machine units in plastic 
packaging manufacturing companies. The analytical method used in this study is to use a fishbone diagram and why 
why analysis to find out the cause of the low OEE value and use FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) in 
determining corrective actions. Based on the results of the analysis, it was found that the first largest losses were 
breakdown losses with a value of 36.4% or 15,849 hours from. While the second losses are setup and adjustment 
losses with a value of 20.1% or 8,752 hours of machine operating time. Improvement efforts made are by 
performing autonomous maintenance, changing the frequency of PM (Preventive Maintenance), and making spare 
part stock planning by determining the minimum stock of spare parts. From the results of the improvements that 
have been made, it can be declared quite effective because the OEE value increased by 10.6%.

1. Introduction 
The industrial sector is the largest contributor to the national economy with a contribution of more than 20%. In the 
National Industrial Development Master Plan (RIPIN) for 2015-2035, it is stated that there is an increase in 
industrial development targets every five years. The RIPIN 2015 – 2035 is stipulated by Government Regulation 
No. 14 of 2015 and compiled as an implementation of the mandate of Law No. 3 of 2014 concerning Industry, as 
well as being a guide for the government and industry players in industrial planning and development. 
 
Based on the qualitative and quantitative criteria of the national industry, RIPIN sets 10 priority industries which are 
grouped into 3 types of industry, namely the mainstay industry, the supporting industry, and the upstream industry. 
The two main industrial sectors are the food industry and the pharmaceutical, cosmetic & medical device industry. 
The plastic packaging industry, which is the downstream chemical sector, has so far been a supply chain for 
consumer products, especially being part of the two major industrial sectors mentioned above. 
 
With the increasing demand for plastic packaging, industry players are required to maintain the productivity and 
quality of the products they produce. In order to maintain product performance, control over the production process

1421","Meanwhile, when compared between the OEE values before and after repairs can be seen in the table 3. The OEE 
value before repair was 51.6% and after improvement was 62.2%. It can be seen that there is an increase in the OEE 
value even though it still cannot reach the ideal OEE value according to the World Class Company, which is 85%.

These findings have analyzed the impact of root causes on the achievement of OEE scores. As well as corrective 
steps taken to eliminate Six Big Losses as an effort to improve the performance of the blow machine. That the 
corrective steps taken were able to increase the value of the availability rate on the blow machine. It is known that 
the availability value achieved has increased but is still below the World Class Manufacturing Standard. Availability 
value achieved is 86.5% where the availability value according to World Class Manufacturing Standard is 90%. This 
shows that the occurrence of downtime on the blow machine has not been completely resolved and further corrective 
action is needed. The performance efficiency value achieved is still below the World Class Manufacturing Standard. 
The value of performance efficiency achieved is 73.9% where the availability value according to Standard World 
Class Manufacturing is 95%. This shows that the blow machine is still often idle and the engine speed is below the 
specified cycle time standard. This affects the low achievement of the value of performance efficiency. The quality 
rate achieved is still below the World Class Manufacturing Standard. The quality rate value achieved is 97.4% 
where the quality rate value according to Standard World Class Manufacturing is 99.9%. This shows that quality 
problems are still found in the products produced by the blow machine. However, on average the defects that occur 
tend to be constant both before and after the repair step. So that the corrective steps have not been focused on 
handling non conformance products. 
 
Based on the three OEE parameters above, the current OEE value is 62.2%. The achievement of this OEE value is 
still below the World Class Manufacturing Standard of 85.4%. This shows that the blow machine performance is 
still low after the repair step even though there has been an increase before the repair step. The most influential 
factor on the achievement of the OEE value is performance efficiency. This illustrates that the use of the blow 
machine is not maximized because breakdowns are still found.  
 
5. Conclusion 
The conclusions of this research activity are: 
1. The low OEE value is caused by high losses in the blow machine and the root causes of the problems found 
include:  
a) Stock of spare parts that are not available 
b) PM is not conducted consistently 
c) Spare parts replacement scheduling has not been effective 
d) Spare part components do not meet specifications 
2. Improvement efforts made are by performing autonomous maintenance, changing the PM frequency from 3 
months to 1 month and making good spare parts stock planning by determining the minimum spare part stock 
that must be met. 
Based on the results of the research that has been concluded above and in an effort to improve the 
performance of this blow machine, several suggestions are submitted for further research: 
1. The implementation of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is very important to maintain machine 
performance in accordance with the initial design of the factory. This will be able to reduce losses on the 
machine such as breakdown losses. TPM must be run with a high commitment from the maintenance 
department. 
2. The blow machine operator is advised to be able to run the machine optimally according to the work 
instructions that have been made. In addition, the blow machine operator must carry out autonomous 
maintenance consistently so that the engine performance is better.

1430","3. Companies must carry out regular monitoring and control of engine performance indicators through 
achieving OEE values and their implications for Six Big Losses. 
4. For further research, this research is to improve performance efficiency by looking at other factors that may 
still have not been explored in this study as a result of the limited time of the study and the object of the 
research itself.

Abstract 
 
A work accident is an incident when a worker is at work that causes injury or health problems. According to the 
Indonesian Ministry of Industry's Data and Information Center (2019), Work accident cases in several companies in 
Indonesia in 2018 were 173,105 people. The death rate due to work accidents was 5318 people. The tissue company 
has several machines because it produces many types of tissue. The facial engine produces tissue for the face, while 
the napkin machine produces tissue to eat or place on the dining table, and the rolling machine produces tissue 
placed on the toilet. The number of production processes makes the level of risk of work accidents and occupational 
diseases have a high probability. The number of work accidents fluctuates and is influenced by occupational safety 
and health. This study aims to determine the factors that cause work accidents and eliminate the risk of harm in work 
activities in the HIRADC form.  The research method used is qualitative. The primary data of this study were 
obtained from distributing questionnaires to 150 employees who work in the production area, interviews, and the 
results of focus group discussions. Testing this research hypothesis by testing the validity and reliability using SPSS 
software, the method used in this study is the PDCA method and uses the HIRADC form. Three indicators cause 
work accidents: SOPs, work environment, and work programs.

At the planning stage, three indicators cause work accidents, namely the work environment, SOPs, and work 
program. Based on the results of the reliability test will be stated reliability if the value of Cronbach's alpha is 
greater than the value of 0.7. The Cronbach alpha value is 0.738 > 0.7, so the results of the questionnaire for all 
indicators are said to be reliable. Researchers tested the validity of 150 respondents. The degree of freedom ( df ) 
using the n-2 formula is obtained df = 148 with a significance of 5%, then the R table is 0.1348. So when the 
validity test is carried out, the Pearson value is greater than the  R table, all statements are declared valid 
 
At the do stage of compiling all the potential hazards and risks of work accidents in tissue processing companies, all 
production processes can be identified what the potential hazards and sustainable regulations are. Activities that 
have light risk are manual sealing machine processes, placing finished goods onto pallets, and packing processes by 
operators. 
 
At the check stage, the HIRADC assessment is determined based on the production process activities with a focus 
group discussion. At the check stage, there are two activities with extreme risk, namely bringing jumbo rolls from 
the raw material warehouse to the machine area using a clam forklift lifting and laying jumbo rolls using a hoist 
crane. The activity of carrying jumbo rolls from the raw material warehouse to the machine area using a clam 
forklift has several hazards, namely work activities using powered devices, carrying forklifts with a visible angle, 
checking forklift brakes. before work starts. Meanwhile, the lifting and laying of jumbo rolls using a hoist crane has 
4 (four) hazards, namely lifting and rigging activities, the remote button does not function properly, the sealing cable 
is not suitable for use, the hook movement is not precise when lifting and placing it to unwind the jumbo roll. 
 
The action stage determines the action plan to eliminate risk. After completing the focus group, discussion solutions 
are obtained to minimize the risk of work accidents in detail. Engineering control: Paying attention to lanes, areas, 
signs, or prohibition signs as well as forklift driving speed limits. Ensure and perform start-ups or check that the 
remote control is functioning properly before use. Administration: Conduct training related to the dangers and risks 
of driving a forklift, Work instructions related to crane operation. Personal protective equipment: Use a safety 
helmet, mask, and safety belt. 
5. Conclusion 
1) 
Three indicators cause work accidents, namely the work environment, SOPs, and work programs. The 
highest indicator in causing work accidents is the K3 program. 
2) 
Extreme risk, namely bringing jumbo rolls from the raw material warehouse to the machine area using a 
clam forklift, lifting and placing jumbo rolls using a hoist crane. Action plans are carried out to minimize 
extreme risks using engineering control, administration, and personal protective equipment.

Abstract  
 
The downtime experienced in the Nigerian manufacturing sector has become a threat to its existence due to the cost 
implications. Despite different maintenance strategies, the results have not been too promising, hence the need to 
understand the factors causing downtime and effect on machine availability. Root cause analysis of two years 
breakdown data of a Beverage Company in Nigeria using the Five Why approach reviews that man and method are 
the predominant cause of failures in a production system which are both a measure of the organizational workforce 
competency. The result shows that 95 per cent of the total downtime was due to man and method problems while a 
cumulative of 92 per cent of the total number of failures could be linked to man and method. Man and method issues 
are functions of skill of the workforce with the effect is obvious in the percentage of breakdown and the incurred 
downtime in restoring the failure on a machine.

1. Introduction  
Competitive pressure has forced companies to use their equipment's durability and efficiency as a strategic 
advantage. Executives in asset-intensive industries find unforeseen physical asset failures to be a key operating 
threat to their companies (Meissner et al., 2021). In dynamic manufacturing supply chains, unintended downtime 
can be destructive and imposes high costs due to forgone efficiency.  To improve the efficiency and durability of 
equipment, maintenance activities such as repairs or replacements, system upgrades (consider changes in production 
pace, for example), scheduled overhauls and corrective measures are carried out (Rokhforoz & Fink, 2021). 
According to the way these interventions are applied, different maintenance policies can be distinguished ranging 
from conventional corrective maintenance to more sophisticated preventive maintenance policies such as condition-
based or predictive maintenance. 
 
Typically, there is a disarray in alignment with the expected benefits from maintenance strategies and attained 
performance. While practitioners may seem to be doing things right, with various maintenance activities in place to 
improve system reliability, the effectiveness is still questionable. Effective action plans for reliability and 
performance improvement require the identification of shortcomings to elucidate the pattern of flaws. Maintenance 
indices such as mean time to repair (MTTR), availability and mean time before failure (MTBF) measure the effects 
of failure but do not illuminate the pitfalls in the maintenance activities.  
Consequently, there is a need to uncover the issues affecting equipment performance in addressing maintenance 
pitfalls and to generate effective action plans for maintenance management, thereby maximizing the achievable 
benefits. To reduce machine downtime, it is imperative to have a detailed understanding of the different factors that 
contribute to the machine’s unavailability.  
 
This study aims to determine the predominant elements affecting the effective application of maintenance policies in 
a Beverage Company in Nigeria, based on the root cause of failure analysis and understand the link between 
different root causes of problems to their respective source in the production system.

1439","Even though a production plant is applying the correct maintenance techniques, the expected result may still not be 
achieved as there are other factors affecting the applicability of maintenance strategies. From the analysis of the 
major breakdowns in the plant, man and method are the cuprite and both are a function of the functional competency 
of the maintenance team in following the prescribed maintenance system. Figure 5 reviewed a 95 per cent of the 
total downtime was due to man and method problems while a cumulative of 92 per cent of the total number of 
analyzed failures were traced to man and method as shown in Figure 6. Man and method issues are functions of skill 
and attitude of the workforce and thus the effect of competency is obvious in the percentage of breakdown that is 
attributed to man and method and the incurred downtime in restoring the failure on a machine. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Analyses of breakdown data without understanding the underlying failure mechanisms will lead to a wrong 
conclusion and subsequent recurrence of failure. The failure mode of any breakdown must be linked to the root 
cause before such failure can be permanently eliminated by the implementation of appropriate countermeasures. 
From our study, over 90 per cent of downtime experienced during production was attributed to either man or 
method. Man and method issues are functions of skill and attitude of the workforce in following a defined 
maintenance system. Deficiency in either skill or attitude greatly affects the resulting functional competency as the 
performance of a technician during evaluation may not exactly represent the field performance. Thus, the major 
factor that contributes to this deviation is the nature of maintenance activities which include the utilization of 
alternative maintenance approaches and the knowledge gap in the maintenance team in carrying out efficient 
maintenance regarding a Nigeria case study.

Abstract  
 
Shale gas has been regarded as one of the most promising energy sources to sustain the world’s energy demand. 
However, its exploration is still underdeveloped in several countries due to a lack of methods and technology 
implementation compared to conventional hydrocarbon exploration. In addition, the technology, methods, and data 
available in various oil and gas companies are currently still concentrated on conventional hydrocarbon exploration. 
The purpose of this study is to propose a new comprehensive method in shale gas exploration by utilizing the 
existing conventional hydrocarbon exploration data using data science and decision analysis approaches. The 
methods used in this study are K-Mean Clustering to cluster the similar rock characters (TOC, Porosity, Water 
Saturation, and Poisson Ratio) then continued by Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis to determine the best rock cluster 
for shale gas exploration. The study takes Banuwati Shale Formation in Asri Basin as a case which is well known as 
one of the promising source rocks in Indonesia. Based on this study, the rocks in the study area can be classified into 
three clusters. Cluster 1 is determined as “High Fractability Cluster”, Cluster 2 is determined as “Water Saturated 
Cluster” and Cluster 3 is determined as “High Organic Content Cluster” based on its physical and chemical 
properties. Meanwhile, Cluster 3 is determined as the best cluster with 10212 ft – 10412 ft (3113 m – 3174 m) depth 
interval preferred as the sweet spot for Shale Gas exploration based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis result.

1. Introduction 
Fossil energy is predicted to remain as the main commodity to fulfill energy needs in Indonesia until 2050 (Malik, 
2021). The same thing happened globally where fossil energy sources, especially natural gas, dominate a quarter of 
the world's energy consumption (Tan et al. 2018). To respond to these conditions, several countries such as the 
United States, Russia, and China have started to increase shale gas exploration to increase the reserves of 
hydrocarbon energy. Meanwhile, shale gas exploration in is considered still not much developed in several countries 
around the globe. Indonesia is one of the finest examples among oil and gas producing countries (PWC, 2019). With 
574 TCF (trillion cubic feet) of shale gas potential (LEMIGAS, 2018), Indonesia has a great opportunity to increase 
the reserves of domestic hydrocarbon energy sources through shale gas commodities. The lack of shale gas 
exploration is predicted caused by low studies, methods, and technology implementation compared to conventional 
oil and gas exploration. In addition, the technology, methods, and data available in various oil and gas companies 
are currently still concentrated on conventional hydrocarbon exploration. A new and comprehensive method to 
utilize conventional hydrocarbon exploration data for shale gas exploration seems to be one of the promising moves 
not only to speed up shale gas exploration but also minimize effort and operational cost. The purpose of this study is 
to determine shale gas sweet spot depth interval in one well using data science and decision analysis approaches by 
utilizing existing conventional hydrocarbon exploration data. This method is expected to be an option to perform an 
optimum operation to do shale gas exploration both in the side of effort and cost so the unconventional hydrocarbon 
exploration can be accelerated.

previous research. The literature review was done to make sure that the study conducted does not replicate any

This study analyzes the new method to determine shale gas weet spot depth interval using data science and decision 
analysis approaches. The data obtained from one exploration well data located in Asri Basin, Indonesia with 
Banuwati Shale Formation as the main target of the study. The result of sweet spot determination is shown in Figure

The methods used in this study are K-Mean Clustering, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Multi-Attribute 
Utility Theory (MAUT). The result of data clustering shows that the data in this study can be clustered into three 
clusters. Cluster 1 is determined as High Fractability Cluster, cluster 2 is determined as Water Saturated Cluster and 
cluster 3 is determined as High Organic Content Cluster. The preferred cluster was obtained from AHP and MAUT 
methods using experts judgment questionnaires as the data. The result suggested that Cluster 3 is the most preferred 
cluster with a 0.793 preference score followed by Cluster 1 with 0.242 and Cluster 2 with a 0.124 preference score.  
 
Mckeon (2013) stated that the minimum thickness of shale layer to be able to produce hydrocarbon commercially is 
100 ft. or equal to 30.5 m. Referring to the actual condition in the exploration well, there is one horizon of Cluster 3 
rocks which exceed 100 ft. thick and can be determined as sweet spot zone that is the 10212 ft. – 10413 ft. (3113 m 
– 3174 m) interval or equal to 201 ft. (61 m) thick. This interval determined as the most preferred spot for shale gas 
exploration. 
 
6.1 Proposed Improvement 
Future research is highly recommended for the more accurate and more comprehensive result of the study. Future 
research suggested utilizing more petrophysical properties as parameters to minimize uncertainty. Aside from that, 
more data utilization of the well is also highly recommended so the result of each well can be correlated and produce 
more comprehensive sweet spot mapping in 2D and 3D results.

Abstract 
In this study, the impeller is optimized in order to make advances in the performance of a centrifugal water pump. 
A centrifugal pump design incorporates many limitations that affect pump performance. By modifying the 
parameters within an acceptable range, it improves pump performance and results in saving of costs and energy 
for companies. The design parameters from vane plane improvement are chosen for the impeller plan, and the 
influence of the plan parameters on the pump's performance is analyzed using computational fluid dynamics to 
optimize the impeller. The findings shows that suction diameter, impeller diameter and discharge diameter have 
a significant impact on the performance of a centrifugal pump.

1. Introduction  
Pumps are widely used in industry to supply cooling and oil organizations, to transfer fluids for planning, and to 
offer intentional control in weight-driven systems pumping (Hydraulic Institute and Europump, Matlakala et al., 
2019a). In reality, most collecting plants, trade buildings, and regions rely on pumping systems for routine 
operation. Pumps address about 27 percent of the control used by cutting-edge systems in the amassing region 
(Matlakala et al., 2019b). Pumps are mostly used in warming, ventilation, and cooling (discuss conditioning) 
systems in the trade region to allow water to warm trade. Pumps are used in municipalities for water and 
wastewater movement and treatment, as well as for arrival leaks (Matlakala et al., 2019b). Pumps differ in size 
from parts of a drive to a couple of thousand quality because they fulfill such specific needs (Berkeley, 2014).

1464","6. Conclusions and Recommendations 
The pumping system capacity and optimization has been carried out for water as the working fluid. The impeller 
diameter plays a huge role in centrifugal pump performance and decreasing impeller diameter result in a decrease 
in the flow rate, head, and power consumption. A decrease in the impeller diameter gives a centrifugal pump a 
new operating point. If the pump is to be trimmed, the pump manufacturer should be consulted first because the 
reduction of impeller affects the flow rate and head. Affinity law was mathematically used to analyse. This was 
to better understand the effect that varying impeller diameter has on the overall performance of a centrifugal pump 
and to actually enable the analysis of different impeller diameters. The diameter of the impeller, impeller suction 
diameter and the discharge diameter were changed to optimize the pumping capacity of a water pump. The original 
impeller diameter was 223 mm, and this was then varied to 217 mm and 211 mm. Final results found showed that 
reducing the impeller will have a reduced flow rate power consumption and head. To accomplish bigger head and 
flow rate, a bigger impeller is required, but higher energy usage because of a larger impeller is the biggest 
challenge. This bigger energy consumption can be decreased by using a lesser weight impeller. It can easily be 
accomplished by using a lesser weight material for the impeller. When selecting the material of the impeller, the 
fluid being pumped should be taken into consideration and the life span of the impeller should also be considered.

Abstract 
 
Centrifugal pumps are the most often used pumping equipment in hydraulics. They are hydraulic machinery that 
transform mechanical energy into hydraulic energy. A pump is a mechanical device that transports fluids from 
one location to another. Because of the 3D flow structure involving turbulence, secondary flow, cavitation, and 
unsteadiness, the flow analysis inside the centrifugal pump is quite complicated. In recent years, advances in the 
accuracy of numerical methods and increased availability of computational resources have taken turbo machinery 
computational fluid dynamics technologies from the realm of pure research into the competitive industrial market. 
In this project calculations for compressible fluids and unsteady flow were done using continuity equations and 
for incompressible fluid Navier-Stoke equations. The achieved Reynold number shows that the flow is turbulent 
with all other parameters of volume flow, tangential velocity and specific speed calculated. This study has shown 
that to avoid cavitation at high flow rates and pump failure, the stator blades must be modified to improve the 
transfer of the kinetic energy of the water flow to pressure energy.

1. Introduction 
A centrifugal pump is a mechanical device that moves a fluid by transferring rotational energy from one or more 
impellers (Anderson Pump and Process, Matlakala et al. 2019a). The impeller raises the velocity and pressure of 
the fluid and directs it towards the pump exit. The centrifugal pump is straightforward to understand, operate, and 
maintain because of its simple design. A time-dependent continuity equation for mass conservation, three time-
dependent conservation of momentum equations, and a time-dependent conservation of energy equation makes 
up the Navier-Stokes equations (Hall 2015). Irrigation, water supply plants, steam power plants, sewage, oil 
refineries, chemical plants, hydraulic power service, food processing facilities, and mines all employ centrifugal

5. Discussion of Results 
Design and simulation of centrifugal pump was done in Autodesk and ANSYS respectively. The specification 
used to simulate and perform calculations were as per previous reports (Matlakala et al. 2019a) and are listed in 
Table 1. The Navier-Stokes Equations are used to find the type of flow at pump entry which is a turbulent flow as 
Reynold’s calculations show. The pressure at pump exit with values was less than normal (Matlakala et al. 2019a, 
Matlakala and Kallon 2021) which was very low. Theoretically a large pressure is needed to control a low volume 
flow rate. The tangential velocity of the impeller was determined where it showed the impeller rotating at certain 
speed values. If the tangential velocity was close to zero it would affect the suction and discharge diameters and 
rotational speed of the impeller. The pump specific speed was determined to be 5.53 m/s which means the pump 
is running at a high speed. High speed can result to a lot of noise when pump is operational, shaft failure and 
cavitation. Method of reducing the speed of the centrifugal pump must be specified.  
Simulations were done for the impeller where it cracked as the calculated speed was applied. Practically impeller 
work on the calculated speed meaning it will fail and cause cavitation on the housing, flow time set was 5s. Due 
to differences between the calculation and the measurement, it appears that the spaces in front of and behind the 
wheel, where the fluid can escape through the gap between the rotor and the stator and thus aid the flow in the 
pump at higher backpressures, should be included in the calculation.  
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
Centrifugal Pumps with this impeller will fail due to the high speed of the pump and it will result to shaft failure, 
cavitation and make a lot of noise when in use. To avoid cavitation at high flow rates, the impeller blades must be 
redesigned, and the stator blades must be modified to improve the transfer of the kinetic energy of the water flow 
to pressure energy.

Abstract  
 
Several governments worldwide, including the UAE, are faced with an increasing challenge of urbanisation in social 
spaces. Resorting to smart cities to resolve urbanisation, the UAE, and the Abu Dhabi Emirate has made significant 
strides in this regard. An integrative model for improved public satisfaction with the initiative is considered 
important. However, there is no empirical study that validate the measurement models for such integrative model. 
Accordingly, this paper conducted a confirmatory factor analysis for the measurement models of the smart city 
technology dimension, human dimension and institutional dimensions, e-service quality, public satisfaction, trust 
and policy domains which are the input of the integrative structural model. Particular reference is made to the e-
service initiatives of ‘TAMM’ and Jobs Abu Dhabi. A quantitative research method was adopted, considering a 
sample of 384 users of the two selected smart service initiatives. The finding of the research suggest a good fit with 
the following indices; CMIN = 553.724, AGFI = 0.877, RMSEA = 0.050, df = 277, PGFI = 0.713, CAIC = 1033.501, 
P = 0.000, NFI = 0.919, MIN/DF = 1.891, RFI = 0.905, RMR = 0.039, TLI = 0.953, GFI = 0.903, and CFI = 0.960. 
concluded that the smart city technology dimension, human dimension and institutional dimensions, e-service 
quality, public satisfaction, trust and policy domains are distinct and valid measurement models that can be used for 
the development of integrative model for Abu Dhabi, UAE smart city initiative.

1. Introduction 
The 21st century world is becoming more sophisticated with so many attendant urbanisation issues. Countries adopts 
smart city initiative to contend with the issues. As the UAE rely on smart cities to solve these emerging problems, 
one rather challenging outcome is maintaining public satisfaction and, even more importantly, service quality as an 
immediate outcome of service delivery. However, the very underlying blocks of smart city are not well understood 
and have remained ambiguous; this, therefore, serves as one of the key research gaps that must be closed to pave the 
way for practitioner contributions to be established. The UAE and Abu Dhabi, in particular, understand the need to 
tackle the challenge of urbanisation through the Smart City initiative. The planning regimes and general policy 
model start with a leadership vision and the installation of key strategic paths, as witnessed in the Zayed Smart City 
Project introduced from 2018 to 2022 (Abu Dhabi Government, 2018). The Zayed Smart City is not the only project 
in the pipeline, as other projects such as Onwani, a physical address system, and Masdar City have gained increased 
recognition. The Masdar ""Smart"" City Project, for instance, is the first of such renewable energy policy in 2009. 
According to Mezher and Park (2012), this initiative aims to ""advance renewable energy and sustainable 
technologies through education, RandD, investment and commercialisation"". 
 
The Smart Abu Dhabi Initiative, a broader government orientation that encompasses all e-government and smart 
government initiatives, involves the transformation of all government e-services, including the introduction of the 
TAMM, a one-stop portal to serve the complete list of government services into a single city application. Other 
applications, including the Jobs Abu Dhabi, City Guard, and free Wi-Fi in Taxis, are programs partly enrolled and at

The key model fit indices are analysed as part of the present study analysis to better understand the CFA model 
(Table 5). The model fit indices provide highly satisfactory results for nearly all the indicators. None of the 
indicators fell below the recommended ranges as presented in Table 5. The reliability was tested with the help of 
Composite Reliability, whilst Validity was tested with the help of Average Variance Extracted (AVE). All test for 
validity using AVE were above .5 whilst composite reliability for all factors were above .7. All the factor scores in 
the form of standardized regression estimates were also above .6, and all of them significantly predicted their latent 
factors. This data supports that the model is ready and adequate. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study analysed the dimensionality of the research constructs for the development of an integrative model for the 
smart city initiative that will link e-service quality and public satisfaction in Abu Dhabi, UAE. By focusing on the 
two smart city e-service initiatives of TAMM and JOBS ABU DHABI, and the theoretical models of SMART City 
Dimensions (technology, human, and institutional), e-SERVQUAL, public satisfaction, trust and policy domain, this 
research investigated the suitability of the constructs in the development of the model. Prior to the confirmatory 
factor analysis, the threshold. Validity and reliability also proved statistically significant and highly acceptable. 
Based on these results, it can be concluded that the smart city technology dimension, human dimension and 
institutional dimensions, e-service quality, public satisfaction, trust and policy domains are distinct and valid 
measurement models that can be used for the development of integrative model for Abu Dhabi, UAE smart city 
initiative. Further study will therefore use the validated constructs for the development of the integrative structural 
model using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM).

Abstract  
 
The objective of this research is to determine the degree of relationship between the quality of service and customer 
satisfaction in the restaurants of the Los Olivos district, in the year 2021. The study is based on a quantitative and 
correlational approach, with a non-experimental design and cross-sectional classification. To measure the two 
variables, a sample of 381 customers visiting restaurants in Los Olivos was taken. For service quality, the Servqual 
model was used, and for satisfaction, a tool based on factor analysis was used. A survey of 43 questions with a 
Likert scale from 1 to 7 was applied, and the following results were obtained: the general hypothesis was accepted 
with a significant coefficient (p-values < 0.05). Regarding the specific hypotheses, reliability, empathy and tangibles 
are accepted with significant coefficients (p-values < 0.05) in contrast to the dimensions of responsiveness and 
safety which are rejected with non-significant coefficients (p>0.05). In conclusion, restaurants should train staff to 
serve efficiently and improve safety, as well as modernise their facilities and technological capacity to ensure their 
success.

1499","good customer treatment, however, on certain occasions, employees do not comply with immediate attention due to 
high demand from users. 
 
In relation to specific hypothesis 1, the results determined that this dimension is significantly and positively related 
to customer satisfaction. These results correspond with the study of Barinotto (2019) on customer satisfaction 
regarding the service quality of the collaborators and states that the service quality is regular in relation to customer 
satisfaction, however, in his results he obtains a high reliability regarding satisfaction, causing a level of confidence 
with customers to revisit the restaurant. 
 
On the other hand, specific hypothesis 2, which states that safety is related to customer satisfaction in restaurants in 
the district of Los Olivos in 2021, the results determined that this dimension is not significantly related to customer 
satisfaction. These results coincide with the study by Silva et al. (2021), as they conclude that the correlations 
between safety and customer satisfaction are too low not causing a practical implication with customers, i.e., if the 
customer feels insecure with the services received in the establishment, he/she would have an unfavourable opinion 
regarding the service. 
 
Similarly, specific hypothesis 3 states that responsiveness is related to customer satisfaction in restaurants in the 
district of Los Olivos in 2021. The results found that this dimension is not significantly related to customer 
satisfaction. These results correspond with the study by Causado et al. (2019) and mention that the sensitivity or 
responsiveness of staff fails to respond urgently to customer requirements, which is why customers are dissatisfied, 
the measures to be taken are to respond promptly and efficiently, reducing waiting times.   
 
According to specific hypothesis 4, empathy is related to customer satisfaction in restaurants in the Los Olivos 
district in 2021. The results found that this dimension is significantly and positively related to customer satisfaction. 
In this regard, Cadena et al. (2016), in their study on the measurement of customer service quality in restaurants in 
Sonora, Mexico, mention that empathy reflects a good perception of service quality, i.e., the service provides 
personalised attention by employees, this interaction makes the dimension better valued and thus satisfies the needs 
of customers.  
 
Finally, specific hypothesis 5 states that tangible elements are related to customer satisfaction. The results found that 
this dimension is significantly and positively related to customer satisfaction. In this sense, Silva et al. (2021) point 
out in their research on the relationship between service quality, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in a 
commercial company in Mexico, that tangible aspects play a strategic role in customer satisfaction levels, because 
elements related to the appearance of facilities, staff, equipment, are highly valued considerations in the customer 
evaluation process for their conformity.   
 
5. Conclusion  
It was determined that there is an acceptable relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction in 
restaurants in the district of Los Olivos in 2021. The hypothesis put forward in this research is established as valid. 
Likewise, service quality has an impact on customer satisfaction and has repercussions on the continuous 
improvement of the infrastructure and services offered. 
 
The dimensions of reliability, empathy and tangible elements were found to have a positive influence on customer 
satisfaction in restaurants, while sensitivity and safety had a negative influence on customer satisfaction. Tangible 
elements have a greater positive impact on customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is necessary for restaurants to 
improve the image of their staff and strive to provide facilities with reliable technological equipment to their 
customers. Restaurants in the district of Los Olivos in 2021 should prioritise the modernisation of their facilities and 
technological equipment, as these are features that the customer evaluates along with the quality of the food and the 
service. If they comply with these three elements that relate to and influence satisfaction, it would be an important 
support to meet the objectives and profitability of the restaurants.   
 
It is recommended for future research on the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction in 
restaurants, to classify the speciality of the restaurants (Creole, marine, traditional) and to extend the study to 
Metropolitan Lima, in order to achieve quantitative research and obtain more precise results that will allow the 
owners of these establishments to make better decisions to satisfy the needs and desires of their customers.

Abstract 
 
Plastic is a wear resistance, easy to use, and cheap material. It was required by so many industries, so the quantity of 
plastic production in Indonesia increases every year. The increase in plastic production makes the volume of plastic 
waste generated by households. The unmanaged plastics waste releases various harmful substances for humans and 
the environment. To reduce this negative impact, a reverse logistics network for plastic waste, the recovery flows of 
plastic waste, is designed. This study constructed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for reverse logistics 
network design for plastic waste management in Indonesia to minimize the total cost from opened facilities cost, 
processing cost, and transportation cost. Then, due to uncertainty of the quantity of returned plastic from the 
consumer, the first MILP model is reformulated into mixed-integer robust programming (MIRP). The MIRP model 
also figured out the optimal location of selected facilities and the quantity of plastic transported from one facility to 
the others, under uncertainty.

1. Introduction 
There were two million tons of plastic produced in 1950, and the amount continued to rise to 380 million tons in 
2015 (Liang et al. 2021). The increase in plastic production can be influenced by economic growth and population. 
The growth of industries also influenced the number of plastic products produced (Hidayat et al. 2019). Besides that, 
the outbreak of the COVID-19 in 2020 further impacted the increasing demand for plastic production due to 
transformations in individual's behaviors and consumption patterns (Khoo et al. 2021). Changes in new habits 
increase demand for plastic, including masks and hand sanitizers, vitamins and medicines, and plastic for package 
wrap.  
 
Rising plastic production increases the amount of plastic waste. The excess of global plastic waste produced reaches 
1.6 million tons per day (Benson et al. 2021). About 9% of plastic waste goes through the recycling process, 12% 
goes through the incineration process, and 79% remains in landfills (Khoo et al. 2021). Plastic waste that is not 
appropriately managed can negatively impact the environment and humans. For example, piled up landfills, and if 
plastic waste is not managed correctly, it can release various harmful substances that pollute water, soil, and air.  
 
Reverse logistics (RL) can be used to reduce the negative impact of the increasing amount of plastic waste (Kilic et 
al. 2015). RL is a series of planning, implementation, and management processes linked to the evaluation and proper 
allocation of waste to collect residual value from end of use or end of life products (Valenzuela et al. 2021). RL is 
different from forward logistics, where raw materials are converted into finished goods. In RL, the products that get 
returned will be remade into finished goods again. One of RL's decisions is to design the logistics network. Reverse 
logistics network design (RLND) is a strategic or long-term decision determining waste management facilities' 
number, location, and allocation (Valenzuela et al. 2021).  
 
In the RLND decision-making process, data uncertainty on the parameters is unavoidable and essential to consider. 
The conditions of uncertainty are important to consider because of the lack of sufficient and accurate information in

1507","The MIRP model is tested and validated using a case study of plastic waste management in Jakarta. From the MIRP 
model, the optimal location of selected facilities and the quantity of plastic transported from one facility to the others 
that minimize the total cost are obtained. The solution minimizes the total cost with uncertainty in the quantity of 
returned plastic from the consumer. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Due to uncertainty in RLND of plastic waste management in Indonesia, a MIRP model is proposed using Robust 
Optimization. In this study, RL network of plastic waste management in Indonesia consider consumer, Waste Bank, 
TPS/TPS3R, TPA, Collector, and Recycler. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost from the cost of 
the selected facility, the process at the facility, and transportation between facilities. First, a MILP model for RLND 
for plastic waste management in Indonesia is constructed. To cope with uncertain parameters in MILP model, the 
quantity of returned plastic from the consumer is assumed to reside in the box uncertainty set. Then, a robust 
counterpart of the uncertain MILP model is formulated to find an optimal robust solution. For application of the 
model, the optimal robust solutions, i.e., the optimal location of selected facilities and the quantity of plastic 
transported from one facility to the others, are obtained from the MIRP model by a plastic waste management case 
study in Jakarta. 
 
This study can be developed in the future to address the limitations. For example, the model considers another form 
of uncertainty sets for the uncertain parameters. Also, because uncertainty in optimization problems is often, other 
parameters such as transportation cost, processing costs at the facility, and capacity of the facility can be considered 
in the model.

Abstract  
 
Since the Covid-19 pandemic entered Indonesia in April 2020, the automotive industry experienced the most 
significant decline compared to the other sectors. The downfall was due to weak demand for cars and motorcycles 
from the domestic and foreign market, leading to production cuts. This incident forced the entire automotive 
industry to adjust to returning to normal conditions after the disruption occurred as quickly as possible. There in 
need for Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) to control and manage the 
company's target plans when a disruption occurs at any time. This study aims to design KPI to help firms in 
assessing the indicators related to disruption as long-term measures. This study utilized expert assessments, gathered 
from questionnaires, while quantitative data was processed using the Content Validity Index (CVI). From the 
literature review, 11 indicators such as security, knowledge management, visibility, risk management, collaboration, 
agility, flexibility, efficiency, redundancy, financial strength, market position and 46 sub-indicators of SCR were 
collected. Using the CVI approach for validity test results, 27 SCR sub-indicators were validated by six experts in 
the sector, with an average I-CVI value of 0.81.

1. Introduction  
The ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in December 2019 
in Wuhan, China. World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic on February 11, 2020 (Lai et al. 2020). 
Since then, governments worldwide have been carried out various strategies and actions to fight the pandemic and 
recover the economic. One of the ways to prevent its spread is to restrict and completely close the border, which in 
the process could lead to unfavorable impacts on consumer spending, investment, and disruption to international 
trade and global supply chains (Belhadi et al. 2020). This situation makes all companies tightened their operations 
with to help their business survive. 
 
Many problems that interfere with the company’s production and distribution, such as natural disasters, political 
turmoil, fuel crises, disease, and terrorism, have increasingly occurred in recent years (Tukamuhabwa et al. 2015). 
As for now, the global pandemic gave a significant impact on every country’s economy, including Indonesia. 
Economic conditions in a country based on a specific period can be seen from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
Statistics Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik) stated that the GDP growth rate in Indonesia decreased drastically since 
the beginning of 2020 compared to the previous year from 4.96% to 2.97% (BPS 2020). It proves that Indonesia’s 
economic condition has been affected and is not normal because of the pandemic. 
 
Bappenas, the Ministry of National Development Planning Republic of Indonesia (2020) stated that from many 
industrial sectors in Indonesia, the automotive industry had significant negative growth of minus 30 percent due to 
weak demand for cars and motorcycles from the domestic and foreign market, leading to production cuts. Different 
sources stated that individual’s purchasing power related to vehicles was disrupted because people prefer to save 
their money for basic needs rather than buying or replacing vehicles (Fea 2020). It indicates that this industry is 
vulnerable to disruption, and preventive measures are required to increase resilience in the future. One of the 
preventive actions is through Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for supply chain resilience (SCR) to control and

6. Conclusion  
Supply chain resilience is a hot topic in the research world. It attracted the attention of many individuals due to its 
relevance to the current pandemic conditions. Supply chain resilience itself is a concept that developed from 
traditional risk management. This study reveals that the Indonesian automotive industry is still vulnerable to 
disruption, shown by the experienced automotive industry's most significant decline compared to the other sectors 
during the pandemic. That is why we need indicators that are practical to develop a resilient supply chain. This 
research resulted in 11 indicators and 27 sub-indicators of SCR, collected from previous research and validated by 
automotive field experts as shown in figure 1. Therefore, this research contributes to decoding the concept of 
resilience into performance indicators to create a useful managerial tool for improving performance.

There are some limitations to this research. This study only discusses the SCR indicator, collected from previous 
research and relevant to Indonesia's automotive industry. Six experts from different automotive companies 
represented the validation of these indicators. There are still several indicators and sub-indicators not mentioned in 
this study that may be relevant in other sectors. Thus, the basis of this research cannot be generalized. Future 
research should be directed at indicators from other sectors that have not yet been explored and find new indicators. 
That way, the SCR indicator can be generalized and used in different kinds of company's sectors.

Abstract 
 
The trend of using cosmetic products in Indonesia is not only exclusively for women but also has expanded for men 
and children. Until 2019, the Indonesian government recorded 797 domestic cosmetic companies from small, 
medium, and large scale, which increased compared to 760 companies in the previous year. The cosmetics industry's 
performance also grew by 5.59% in 2020 and contributed to foreign exchange for export with USD 317 million, 
increasing 15.2% compared to the previous year. Supply chain flow in business activities is undoubtedly a 
complicated issue to discuss because the activities, connections, and interrelationships between elements from 
upstream to downstream are full of risks and uncertainties. This study aims to conceptualize a supply chain risk 
model in the Indonesian cosmetics industry to ensure the development of appropriate risk mitigation strategy. This 
research used qualitative data in a questionnaire assessment by experts, processed using a Content Validity Index 
(CVI) approach. A total of 20 sub-indicators have been successfully validated from 36 sub-indicators by five experts 
in the cosmetics industry with an average I-CVI value of 0.91.

1. Introduction 
People use cosmetics to beautify themselves or change their appearance. Products from the cosmetics industry are 
not only mascara, lipstick, and powder but also refer to products used to clean the body, such as shampoo, 
toothpaste, soap, deodorant, as well as products for health purposes such as acne creams, whitening creams, and 
more (Sahota 2014). Until 2019, the Indonesian government recorded 797 domestic cosmetic companies from small, 
medium, and large scale, which increased from the level of in the previous year (Ministry of Industry of the 
Republic of Indonesia 2020). In addition, the Ministry of Industry revealed that the government continues to support 
the growth of the domestic cosmetics industry. The industry's performance grew by 5.59% in 2020 and contributed 
to the country's foreign exchange with an export value of USD 317 million, or an increase of 15.2% compared to the 
previous year. There are three things that are potential in stimulating the growth of the cosmetics industry in the 
country. First, Indonesia has a more than 150 million female population with an average age of 28 years old. 
Second, domestic economic growth can be pretty good even though the pandemic hit it. Third, social media 
involvement contributes to the marketing of cosmetic products (Sofia 2021). 
 
Cosmetics are one of the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) product. FMCG is a product sold in large 
quantities with a relatively low-profit margin. In addition, the character of this product is that if it is not available, it 
can be quickly replaced by competing products (Elzakker et al. 2014). Generally, products produced by FMCG 
companies have a shorter shelf life or can expire and have the potential to decrease quality over time, so they must 
be given special care (Golestani et al. 2021).

6. Conclusion 
The slightest risk that arises in the supply chain flow will undoubtedly affect the organization's smooth business 
activities. This research successfully identify the possible risks that emerge in the supply chain of Indonesian  
cosmetics industry. A total of 36 risks have been found, consisting of 6 factors: supply and logistics, manufacturing, 
organizational and strategic, financial, marketing, and macro. After validation process with experts, the researcher 
found 20 relevant risks in the supply chain of the cosmetics industry in Indonesia with the average of I-CVI value is 
0,91. The limitation of this research is that the research is limited to identifying, classifying, and validating risks in 
the supply chain of the cosmetics industry in Indonesia. Further research can be carried out using the Multi-criteria 
Decision-making (MCDM) method such as ANP-based DEMATEL to determine the priority of the risks that arise 
so that they can be carried out for consideration inappropriate risk mitigation strategies.

Abstract 
 
The occurrence of accidents in the construction industry in Peru has been a great concern since they generate delays 
in the fulfillment, but above all, they generate justified absences to the injured workers, due to the medical breaks 
generated, In addition to not being able to perform their duties due to the acquired disability, this also affects the 
workers' daily life, since, being injured, they cannot perform activities ranging from helping with housework to healthy 
recreation with their families, such as playing with their children or enjoying a family outing. When an accident at 
work occurs, the investigation protocol is initiated to identify the root cause of the accident, generally identifying 
personal factors, since in every accident there are always personal factors and work factors present.

1. Introduction 
Internationally, there are several standards that ensure the protection of workers, who are committed to protection 
from the beginning of their work, being the main concern for their protection, assuming together with employers the 
commitment to prevent occupational accidents; construction projects have deadlines that are mostly met, due to the 
few delays caused during its development. 
 
According to recent estimates published by the International Labor Organization (ILO), 2.78 million workers die each 
year due to occupational accidents and occupational diseases (of which 2.4 million are disease-related) and 374 million 
workers suffer non-fatal occupational accidents (ILO, 2019). Although the causes and consequences of occupational 
accidents are easily identifiable and reported almost immediately, the figures do not reflect the full regional picture, 
as they exclude the population not affiliated to social security systems, in addition to the fact that there is a high 
underreporting in each country (PAHO - WHO, 2015). Work accidents are one of the causes of work absenteeism, 
due to the medical breaks that they generate; affecting workers at work, since due to the incapacity generated by the 
work accident they cannot develop their work activities, in addition this incapacity prevents them from developing 
activities of a personal nature, the worker during the time of their rest will not have a normal life until their full 
recovery. Likewise, this absenteeism generates delays in compliance deadlines, and in the eagerness to meet the 
established deadlines, the pressure on workers increases, accelerating the activities and consequently the occurrence 
of new accidents that mainly affect the injured workers. In Peru, several construction projects are being developed in 
which accidents occur for various reasons, currently there is a Law of Safety and Health at Work which is based on 
nine principles for the protection of workers, however, there is no analysis of the causes of accidents that serves as a 
tool for accident prevention.

1535","6. Conclusions 
The immediate causes for all accidents are unsafe acts and unsafe conditions; that is, the occurrence of an accident is 
because the worker is committing an unsafe act, related to a dangerous condition, there is no accident in which only 
the worker has performed a hazardous act without being under a hazardous situation. 
 
The elimination of unsafe acts and unsafe conditions is an effective tool to avoid accidents, the base on which the 
pyramid of the proportion of accidents indicates that the bottom is the incidents without injury or visible damage 
because this base is supported by unsafe acts and unsafe conditions, which are the immediate causes of accidents, 
which is why by eliminating the primary reasons are avoided possible accidents. In this study, it is demonstrated how, 
with the elimination of immediate causes, accidents were reduced in significant proportion in the years 2017 and 2018. 
Leadership is the main link in preventing accidents; the leader’s motivation to his workers serves as a guide to do 
things the right way, complying with the established work standards. Above all, this motivation will drive the worker 
to follow the leader’s example. 
 
Supervision is an effective tool for eliminating immediate causes; therefore, it is the primary tool for accident 
prevention. Personal factors are the ones that cause the worker to commit unsafe acts, while work factors affect in an 
underlying way the decisions that the worker makes to commit a dangerous act.

Abstract 
 
The aim of this research is to determine the relationship between human capital management and productivity in a 
construction company. The research methodology used is quantitative, applied and correlational, with a non-
experimental design and cross-sectional classification. For data collection, the survey technique was applied, using 
the questionnaire as an instrument in a sample of 21 workers in the company. Subsequently, for the statistical 
analyses, the SPSS programme was used, and the Spearman correlation coefficient analysis was used, which yielded 
a significant value of p-value < 0.05, with a positive correlation coefficient of 0.818 on the relationship between the 
two variables studied. Finally, according to the results obtained, it is concluded that there is a positive and strong 
relationship between Human Capital Management and productivity in a construction company in the year 2021. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction  
Nowadays, human capital is defined as a set of skills, knowledge and capabilities of an organisation's workers, 
which allows them to be more efficient, improving the productivity and competitiveness of the company in the 
changing global markets (Checa et al. 2020).  
 
On the other hand, Martinez and Mateus (2020) point out that organisational development is directly connected to 
the management of human capital and productivity, but for this, organisations should not have deficiencies when 
managing human capital because productivity is associated with the performance of people and the optimisation of 
the company's financial, material and technological resources. 
 
After analysing articles, we found several international authors who mention that there is a relationship between 
human capital management and productivity, one of them, Unger et al. (2014), in their research aims to contribute to 
the identification of the characteristics of the economic competitiveness of the states of Mexico, focusing on 32 
entities of the country and concludes that the most competitive entities are in the Federal District, Querétaro, the 
State of Mexico, Jalisco and the northern border states, as they have a more productive and diversified economy 
because they have better human capital and higher wages. Likewise, Bernal et al. (2020), in their study aims to 
identify the relationship between human capital and organisational performance of medium and large companies in 
the state of Tamaulipas (Mexico), for this, they have a sample of 253 companies in the commercial sector in Mexico 
and conclude after using the statistical techniques of correlation and linear regression, that there is a directly 
proportional dependence relationship between human capital and organisational performance where each increase in 
the unit of human capital, organisational performance increases 12 times its value. On the other hand, Caballero 
(2018), in his article aims to identify the internal HR management factors that influence labour productivity in beef 
processing in the meat processing plant Piquete Cue, installed in the city Limpio - Paraguay, in 2016, having as a 
sample 9 participants, concludes that, it is possible to identify the internal management factors that influence labour 
productivity such as: competencies, skills, compensation, employee relations, attitude, work environment, 
performance and motivation. Similarly, Leyva et al. (2020), in their study aim to measure the influence that the 
performance of human capital has on the capacity for technological innovation perceived by managers of SMEs in 
Hermosillo, Sonora (Mexico), therefore, they process a sample of 108 managers, which allowed them to conclude

It was possible to determine that there is a positive and strong relationship between human capital management and 
productivity in a construction company in the year 2021, establishing as valid the general hypothesis put forward in 
the research. 
 
Likewise, it was found that the capabilities, behaviour and labour compensation of human capital are positively 
related to the productivity of the company, as correlations with high coefficients were found between these 
dimensions and labour productivity. This reflects that the capabilities, competencies and positive behaviour of 
personnel, linked to cooperation and teamwork, contribute to the productivity of the company. Similarly, the 
recognition and the fair and equitable wage policy that the company has in place to motivate, retain and engage staff 
results in competitive labour productivity. 
 
On the other hand, the limitation in the development of the study was the access to the people, since, being in 
working hours, they did not have much time available to answer the survey or because of the pandemic some of 
them were doing remote work. However, after several visits to the plant and sending the questionnaire via email to 
the remaining workers, it was possible to survey all workers in the company. 
 
Finally, it is concluded that the present research contributes to the existing literature, because researchers who wish 
to study the sector or the variables human capital management and productivity will be able to use it in their studies. 
Therefore, it is recommended that future studies related to these variables be conducted, since business and 
professional success is directly connected to good practice in human capital management.

Abstract 
 
The Indonesian fashion industry has continuously been growing since the last decade. However, the fashion industry 
practices produce negative environmental and social consequences. To overcome these issues, the Indonesian 
government encourages Indonesian fashion industries to adhere to sustainable practices to maintain and improve 
competitiveness in the global market since it is believed to be the future of the business. Therefore, it is necessary to 
determine the main indicators of sustainable practices in the fashion industry to measure the performance of a 
sustainable supply chain system. This study aims to develop a set of relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) in 
implementing a sustainable supply chain for the Indonesian fashion industry. Initially, this study reviewed the 
existing sustainability indicators to develop an initial short-list of indicators. Then, indicators were assessed and 
validated by a group of eight experts consisting of five industry representatives, a government official, a non-
government organization leader, and an academic through a questionnaire. This study utilized content validity index 
(CVI) methods to get consensus indicators from all experts. From this study, 21 indicators were validated and could 
be further used by the fashion industries to improve their sustainability performance.

1. Introduction 
The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, second only to the oil and gas industry 
(Boström and Micheletti 2016; United Nation 2019). Such a high rate of pollution is caused by the use of synthetic 
dyes (Agustina et al. 2011; Martuti et al. 2020; Sutrisna et al. 2020), which may harm the ecosystem (Martuti et al. 
2020). In addition, the fiber materials used contain microfibers (Sutrisna et al. 2020). Some materials contain heavy 
metals, such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) (Natalina and 
Firdaus 2017; Martuti et al. 2020; Sutrisna et al. 2020). The fashion industry contributes about 10% of global carbon 
emissions (Conca 2015). Nowadays, there is a fashion revolution where fashion trends change from slow fashion to 
fast fashion, so the fashion style changes rapidly with lower prices. One of the reasons is that most fashion products 
are made in developing countries, especially in South and Southeast Asia, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Sri 
Lanka, and Indonesia, where the labor costs are low (Aurelia 2020). Furthermore, unfair labor costs and child labor 
issues emerge from the fast fashion production culture (Aurelia 2020). In relation to these issues, the fashion 
industry needs to be more sustainable by addressing the triple bottom line (TBL) dimensions (Elkington 1997) – 
economic, environmental, and social. In recent decades, research on sustainability has increased rapidly (Bottani et 
al. 2020), yet the research that focuses on sustainable fashion is still very limited (Hassini et al. 2012; Boström and 
Micheletti 2016), especially in the context of developing countries such as Indonesia (Hassini et al. 2012). 
Similar environmental and socio-economic issues can also be found in the Indonesian fashion industry. The main 
sustainability problems in Indonesian fashion industries are related to the environmental aspect, especially in water 
pollution caused by waste from the fashion industries (Belinawati et al. 2018; Harmesa et al. 2020). Water pollution 
mainly occurs in several rivers in Java Island – the primary location of the fashion industry in Indonesia (Badan 
Ekonomi Kreatif Republik Indonesia 2017). For instance, the Citarum River in Bandung is included as 1 of the 10 
most polluted rivers in the world (Black Smith Institute and Green Cross Switzerland 2013). Cimanuk Estuary also

The 21 relevant indicators resulting from this study can be used in the performance management system. For a 
fashion company, these indicators may help create a sustainable system, monitor and evaluate the company’s 
sustainability performance and improve the company’s performance. For the government, these indicators can be 
used as a standard performance monitoring system to monitor and evaluate the sustainable performance of 
Indonesian fashion industries. Therefore, by using these indicators, the fashion companies, together with the 
government, might improve Indonesian fashion industries’ sustainability performance and competitiveness. 
 
5. Conclusion  
It is crucial to identify the relevant KPIs for economic, environmental, and social dimensions to evaluate a 
sustainable supply chain performance. This study explored the appropriate KPIs for a sustainable supply chain in the 
context of the Indonesian fashion industry. We reviewed some literature and identified 31 indicators. These 
indicators include 6 economic indicators, 14 environmental indicators, and 11 social indicators. Then, validation by 
eight experts was carried out and calculated the CVI. Finally, 21 KPIs from the three sustainability dimensions (6 
economic indicators, 8 environmental indicators, and 7 social indicators) were selected with a minimum I-CVI of 
0.875 and S-CVI of 0.847. The fashion industries can use those KPIs to increase their sustainability performance 
and competitiveness. 
This study focused on identifying and validating a set of KPIs for evaluating the performance of a sustainable supply 
chain in the fashion industry. In future research, it is recommended to prioritize and analyze the interrelationship 
between indicators by using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. It is also recommended to 
develop a performance evaluation model that the fashion industries can utilize to measure each indicator and overall 
sustainable performance, so they can regularly evaluate and increase their performance.

Abstract  
 
During these trying times, the non-medical related ones, security guards, and janitors working in hospitals were also 
vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus. The researchers identified factors that influenced the current mental health of 
these vulnerable workers and provided the basis for adequate intervention of mental health problems. The study's 
respondents were janitors and security guards in the healthcare industry within Metro Manila. The significance of 
the variables age, gender, household size, employment status, number of working hours per day, number of minutes 
of break time per day, and monthly income on the total symptom severity score was assessed. The researchers 
gathered data concerning the demographic factors, and PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C) was utilized to 
obtain the Total Symptom Severity Score. Multiple Linear Regression Analysis, Pearson’s Correlation Analysis, and 
Point-Biserial Correlation Analysis were used to determine significant variables. This study suggested a significant 
association between the number of working hours with the total severity score of the respondents among the seven 
demographic variables. The data generated revealed that the total symptom severity score of the respondents 
increased for every hour of working. The researchers recommended that 8 hours every day cause significant positive 
mental health results and well-being benefits. They should avoid working 48 hours or more every week. The 
company should invest in science-based mental health intervention and implement social activities to prevent mental 
health declination.

1. Introduction  
Janitors and security guards in the hospitals are the ones that maintain orderliness and are considered ""virus 
cleaners"" and safety, respectively. They are said to work in a shifting operating schedule of twenty-four hours a day 
from Monday to Sunday, including holidays under contractual employment through third-party agencies (Lung 
Center of the Philippines, 2015). Although these workers are not directly involved in any medical response in the 
health care facility, janitors and security guards serving and working in public hospitals face the same health risks as 
medical healthcare workers (Ramos 2020). They are considered non-medical workers in health facilities 
(Department of Health Administrative Order No. 2022-0001, 2022) who are left unnoticed throughout the current 
Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic (Branson-Potts 2020). In connection, a study conducted by Frutos et a. 
(2020) identified that non-medical workers who carried out essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic 
showed a high level of mental distress. A part of mental health is when an individual realizes his abilities, can cope 
with everyday stresses of life, and work productively. The incoherence of having a good state of mental health, 
promotion, protection, and restoration of mental health are vital concerns of individuals to communities they are in, 
including their workplace. (World Health Organization 2018). However, some elements hinder one's mental health 
steadiness, leading to its deterioration.  
 
A study conducted by Tan et al. (2020) stated that non-medical workers in healthcare facilities experience stress, 
depression, and anxiety associated with the Coronavirus pandemic. The same study indicated that the low mental

among the workers. Based on the same study, it's 40 hours a week, so working 48 hours or more weekly is terrible 
for workers' well-being. The company should invest in preventing and intervening in mental health deterioration to 
lessen its potential effects and long-term complications. Governments and agencies may consider having a mental 
health policy for its health care company that offers mental health sick days off, which allows easing stress levels for 
an individual. Engagement in social activities would highly be recommended, such as group lunch, sports playing, 
short vacation, and team-building activities. Lastly, implementing mental health webinars and one-on-one sessions 
with a professional to learn new skills to cope and manage daily stressors and symptoms associated with the given 
diagnosis.

Abstract  
 
The study aims to the impact of social media exposure and behavioural antecedents on fake news sharing behaviour 
among social media users in Abu Dhabi, UAE using the Theories of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Reasoned Action 
(TRA) as the theoretical foundation. The quantitative research methodology using Partial Least Squares – Structural 
Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed. The research targeted responses from social media users in Abu 
Dhabi Emirate. The study found that the background factors of individual, social and knowledge experiences define 
social media platform exposure of social media users in Abu Dhabi. Exposure to social media has a significant effect 
on social media users' attitudes and perceived norms, but not perceived behavioural control. Nonetheless, attitudes 
and norms have no significant effect on behavioural intention to spread fake news. Only perceived behavioural 
control has an impact on fake news behavioural intention and actual fake news behaviour. The model fit was 
satisfactory with GoF index of 0.4951, and the SRMR, d_ULS, d-G, Chi-Square, NFI fit indices were all within the 
acceptable range. Thus, the data fit the theory adequately. The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge 
by establishing that fake news behavioural intention has a significant influence on social media users' actual fake 
news behaviour.

1. Introduction  
Recent years have been accompanied by the rapid growth of modern forms of web technologies that are widely 
known as social media services or social networking services (Al-Ghaith 2015). The increase in popularity of some 
of the social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have come along with an increase in the 
influence of social media on the daily lives of the individual. This development has attracted and continues to 
command scholars’ attention to the contribution of social media to social and behavioural norms of the public 
(Zhang et al., 2014). Of keen interest to the present discussion and many other studies in the recent decade is the 
threat of social media in global political developments (Bennett, 2012; Bonilla  and  Rosa, 2015). The UAE 
Government and other government agencies in other parts of the globe have been observed to assume their own 
strategies response to negative threats posed by social media, and in efforts to preserve truth and trust as the 
cornerstone of socio-economic development (Bradshaw  and  Howard, 2017; Park et al., 2018).  
 
The threat posed by social media may not be underscored because of the virtual nature of these platforms (Bradshaw  
and  Howard, 2017; Bradshaw  and  Howard, 2018). Several reports have shown the potential of social media 
networks to spread misinformation and create public unrest which threatens national security (Gupta  and  
Kumaraguru, 2011; Nayak, 2014). Social media networks have also been shown to present challenges to law 
enforcement in other areas like fake identities behind the social media accounts that target law enforcement agencies 
with malicious attacks. These fake accounts also create problems in areas of privacy violation and compromise the 
security of innocent citizens among other threats (IACP, 2013; Nexis, 2012).

5. Conclusion 
This study concluded that on social media, all three factors within the scope of the individual, social and knowledge 
significantly define social media platform exposure. Individual elements relevant to social media exposure include 
personality, mood, emotions, perceived risk and perceived opportunity. Knowledge factors relevant to social media 
exposure include ethnic and social class. Knowledge factors relevant to social media exposure include corruption, 
the standard of living, politics, leadership and general knowledge areas; these knowledge areas attract or influence 
social media users’ interests on the social media platforms. The study found that that social media platform exposure 
has a significant effect on the attitudes and perceived norms of social media users in Abu Dhabi. It is however 
concluded that social media exposure does not have a significant effect on perceived behavioural control. These 
conclusions indicate that social media platform exposure has the tendency to change attitudes and affect the what 
users consider socially normal; however, the social media users still retain control over their own behaviours in 
terms of their propensity and locus to act.  
 
The study findings indicate that the attitude and perceived norms influenced by social media exposure does not lead 
to fake news behavioural intention. Social media users rather control their fake news behavioural intention through 
their perceived behavioural control. And their perceived behavioural controls are not exposed to the influencing 
traits of social media platforms usage. This conclusion affirms that the transformation of social media exposure into 
behaviour is impeded by a critical break in the chain within the exposure-behavioural antecedents- intention 
continuum, at least within the context of Abu Dhabi Emirate.  It was also found that that fake news behavioural 
intention has the propensity to influence actual fake news behaviour of social media users in the UAE, and 
specifically Abu Dhabi. Similarly, internal-external fake news source does influence the intention to behave.

Abstract 
 
The supply chain activities of the coffee agroindustry in Indonesia involve several stakeholders, namely farmers, 
collectors, processors, and distribution to consumers. The government has established a project management office 
(PMO) to build a sustainable ecosystem related to the supply chain. Sustainable supply chain activities are economic, 
social, environmental, and technological management activities. 
The purpose of this study is to analyze the supply chain mechanism, measure and assess the sustainable supply chain 
performance index in the agroindustry using SCOR-AHP (Supply Chain Operations Reference-Analytical Hierarchy 
Process). Furthermore, identify the supply chain of agroindustry, analysis of added value, measurement, and 
assessment of sustainable supply chain performance index in agroindustry, using the Multi-Dimensional Scaling 
(MDS) technique. The results of the analysis are used for developing a web-based decision-making system model in 
measuring and evaluating performance

Abstract 
 
The supply chain of the coffee beans is controlled by the export roasters affiliated with the PMA. Especially for the 
export coffee market, where foreign capital investment dominates the coffee bean market because of its ability to 
control the supply chain, parent company's working capital, low bank loan interest rates, and the domain of market 
intelligence. There are several marketing channels for coffee, with the pattern: farmer-collector-wholesaler-dealer-
broker-exporter-national roaster; farmers, traders, collectors, and processors of ground coffee; Farmers - wholesalers 
- intermediaries - exporters. The Indonesian government has established a project management agency (PMO) to build 
a sustainable ecosystem related to the coffee trade supply chain so that farmers are prepared for trade liberalization 
and globalization. The aim of the research is to develop a supply chain management model for the competitive Bali 
Kintamani Coffee stakeholders. The analysis approach using the Analytical Hierarchy Method (AHP), and to identify 
value-added criteria, reliability alternatives and process quality performances to prioritize. Furthermore, an 
information technology decision model was designed.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to look the relationship between instructional leadership style of headmasters with school 
performance excellence in Johor. In instructional leadership there are three dimensions are defining the school 
mission, managing the instructional programs and promote a positive school learning climate, where each dimension 
has its own role. To conduct this study, a total of 433 primary school teachers were involved as respondents. 
Teachers were selected as respondents because they were a mobilized resource to improve school performance. This 
study used quantitative methods and the data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 
and Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Mode (PLS-SEM). The results show definine the school mission and 
managing the instructional program have a significant relationship with school performance. Therefore, it is 
necessary to extend this study to other states in Malaysia order to see the effectiveness of this relationship.

1. Introduction  
The Ministry of Education Malaysia (MOE) intends to make Malaysia a Centre of Excellence Education in the 
Asian region in this century (Yahaya et al, 2011). For that, MOE developed the Malaysian Education Blueprint 
(PPPM) 2013-2025 to be used as a guide to achieve the direction of education in Malaysia. PPPM 2013-2025 is an 
educational transformation that aims to ensure excellent school performance based on school quality and student 
achievement (MOE, 2019). 
 
To ensure that school performance increase, in 2017, MOE has transformed primary school assessment from public 
examination to holistic assessment. This assessment covers the aspects of health, fitness, co-curriculum, classroom 
learning and mastery of students’ tendencies (MOE, 2019). The transformation of assessment had a positive impact 
for the education system. As a result, at the 2018 World Economic Forum, Malaysia was ranked 19th out of 141 
countries.  So, this affect many foreign students interested to studying in Malaysia (Zahirwan, Huzaimah, Yusri, 
Munir, Paiz & Bakhtiar, 2020; Sualman, 2019). 
 
In addition, school performance excellence is also influenced by the leadership qualities of school principals 
(Abdullah, Chen & Ling, 2019). At the same time, school leaders need cooperation from teachers to achieve 
outstanding performance (Nurlaili, 2018). According Nick (2018), through the collaboration of school leaders and 
teachers, leaders can improve the performance from less excellent schools to more excellent ones. In Malaysia, 
school performance measured by Standard Kualiti Pendidikan Malaysia Gelombang 2 (SKPMg2). SKPMg2 consists

1593","The findings of this study contradict with previous studies that say all three dimensions of instructional leadership 
have a significant relationship with school performance excellence (Yen & Abdullah, 2017; Kiflee & Talip, 2015; 
Deidre & Viviane, 2015). While in this study, only define the mission and managing the instructional programs had 
a significant relationship with school performance excellence. Findings of this study are parallel with the findings 
from Philip, Allan and Dao (2017).  Different findings from the expectations of the study because the respondents 
involved in this study are different from the previous researcher respondents. Apart from that, the headmaster 
assessed were also different. It shows that the differences of sources that are assessed (teachers) and assessed 
sources (headmaster) are influencing the findings of the study. Not only that, based on the findings of the study there 
are also differences of the study place and sources studied affect the findings of the study. Furthermore, the results 
of this study are in line with the outcomes from Aryadita (2019) that how an organization can improve its 
performance depends on the resources owned (Aryadita, 2019).   
 
In summary, the results showed that primary school teachers in Johor just admit the dimensions of defining school 
mission and managing instructional programs that are important in the instructional leadership of principals in 
enhancing school performance excellence. This study also clearly shows that the findings of study depend on the 
resources available to evaluate the effectiveness of instructional leadership relationships practiced by teachers to 
improve school performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Overall, this study reveals the instructional leadership style of headmasters towards school performance excellence 
in the state of Johor based on teachers' perspective. The results show that headmasters practice instructional 
leadership in schools. Headmasters also understand and implement the three dimensions of instructional leadership 
(define the mission, managing the instructional programs and promotes) have a positive learning climate. 
 
This study also indicates that headmasters are able to convey the mission of the school clearly and can be understood 
by teachers with appropriate communication. Through the explanations presented, teachers understand that through 
clarity in formulating and conveying the school’s mission contributes to the improvement of school performance 
excellence. The expertise of the headmaster in conducting instructional supervision and guidance, coordinating the 
curriculum and monitoring student progress facilitate the process of managing instructional programs in schools. 
Such actions are realized to be able to help improve school performance. But, the actions of principals by controlling 
teaching and learning time, cultivating professional development, maintaining visibility, providing initiative to 
teachers, providing initiative to students and emphasizing student excellence are less effective towards creating a 
positive school learning climate. Most importantly in instructional leadership, headmaster must be clear and know 
how to implement. While, teachers must understand the instructional leadership delivered by headmaster for 
facilitate school performance excellence to be achieved.

Abstract 
 
Blockchain technology is emerging as a major issue in the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution. Gartner announced 
blockchain technology as a promising future technology along with artificial intelligence technology. Artificial 
intelligence and blockchain are major technologies that speed up innovation and bring about radical changes in all 
industries. Combining these two technologies presents the possibility of redesigning the paradigm for all industrial 
technologies from scratch. Future artificial intelligence technologies will learn and regulate themselves to build their 
own systems. In this paper, we intend to protect personal information in data by efficiently reflecting smart contracts 
using AI technology that predicts charging potential and block chain technology that guarantees the integrity of 
learning data in the recent active R&D of electric vehicle system.  I want to design an electric vehicle charging system. 
In addition, the process of selecting a charging station by dividing the charging system for system implementation 
into before, during, and after charging is exemplified, and the contents necessary for actual implementation for each 
component are presented.

Abstract 
 
This research aim was to design an electromagnetic suspension and regenerative braking system for power 
generation. It looks at ways in which the heat dissipated into the environment from the brakes and suspension can be 
reused by converting it into another form of electrical energy stored in batteries. My research findings indicate how 
the braking efficiencies vary with a number of factors. These include road geography (slopes), braking velocities and 
traffic volumes. The results of this research then helped to narrow down which types of road geography would lead 
to an optimum amount of energy being recovered. Journals of past researches on the topic were reviewed in order to 
help determine how best to design a system that will integrate regenerative braking and the electromagnetic 
suspension. Calculations on determining the optimum braking force needed were done which has led to the final 
chosen concept. This project focused on Electrical Vehicles.

1. Introduction  
In the case of brakes or suspensions, kinetic energy is often released as heat. Friction brakes, which convert kinetic 
energy to heat, are used in the majority of automobiles. This basically means that when you apply the brakes, a lot of 
energy is released as heat (Lakshmi, 2017). Regenerative braking is the conversion of kinetic energy generated 
during braking into a form that can be used right away or stored till later. For most convectional vehicles, the 
majority of the Kinetic energy converted during friction braking, between the brake pads & wheels turns into heat 
which then gets emitted unused into the environment as waste but not when driving a hybrid model or electrical 
vehicle. Using electric motors, a portion of Kinetic energy can be recovered for reuse. This means using a 
regenerative braking system, all the Kinetic energy that would have been lost can partially be put right back into the 
battery.   
 
Every automotive suspension has two goals: passenger comfort and vehicle control. Electromagnetic suspension is a 
system that converts vehicle bump into electrical energy. Its primary function is to reduce effects of vibrations and 
irregularities on roads. This is achieved with the help of shock absorbers that emit vibrational energy in the form of 
heat. This heat is the one that this project aims to harvest and convert into electrical power that can then charge the 
battery. This research proposes a design of a system where the heat lost in the suspension system and brakes 
combined is extracted, converted into a usable form of electrical energy which can charge batteries. In 1967, the 
American Motor Car Company (AMC) created an electrical energy regeneration brake for their concept electric car, 
the AMC Amitron. Toyota was the first car manufacturer to commercialize RBS technology in their Prius series 
hybrid cars (Clark, et al,.2011). Since then there has been an evolution in the regenerative braking systems. Modern

The greater the braking distance, the smaller the braking force which proves that the two are inversely proportional. 
From the formula above, it shows that braking force is directly proportional to the braking force. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Research  
An electromagnetic suspension and regenerative braking system approach was proposed.  The electromagnetic 
suspension system is capable of providing a substantially smoother ride than any luxury sedan, as well as 
significantly less roll and pitch than any sports vehicle. Vehicle Suspension Energy Generation is a very efficient and 
practical method of turning kinetic energy from vehicle movement, particularly the suspension, which is generally 
wasted, into electric energy that may be utilized to power auxiliaries in the vehicle as well as charging the battery. 
The two systems combined ensure that an optimum amount of energy is recovered by making use of clean energy 
which would otherwise be lost into the environment. As technology advances this combined system may become one 
of the promising trends in the vehicle industry. 
 
To achieve maximum efficiency throughout the process, some areas that could be investigated further in future work 
in order to improve the mechanization of the braking system and electromagnetic suspension were identified. The 
following are some suggestions for future work 
 
a) The findings of simulations are not always accurate representations of real-world scenarios. It only serves to give a 
rough notion of whether the chosen approach has enough potential to be implemented in the actual world. As a 
result, it is recommended that the simulation tactics be tested on a real vehicle to fine-tune the recovery values. 
b) In this project brushless DC motors were used due to the availability, characteristics like high starting torque, high 
efficiency and cost. Induction motors can also be used due to their ability to withstand rugged.

Abstract 
 
The biological nutrient removal waste water treatment process requires large amounts of electrical power mainly for 
pumping and aeration. This traditional waste treatment processes proves to be expensive mainly because of this huge 
electricity demand.  However, waste water contains 9.3 times more energy than is used to treat an equivalent volume, 
this is useful energy that is not being tapped into. Herein, an industrial scale Microbial Fuel Cell system is proposed 
to harness this energy in the form of direct electricity using the bacteria found in the waste water whilst 
simultaneously treating the waste water from the municipal waste water treatment plants with an assumed Biological 
Oxygen demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal of 75%. Microbial fuel cells directly capture 
the electrons generated when electrochemically energetic bacteria breakdown organic substrates. Creating electrical 
energy from Microbial Fuel cells is basically as a result of microbes acting as catalyst in degrading the organic 
content and the existence of a potential gradient across the microbial cell membrane. This work evaluated the 
operational parameters of microbial Fuel Cell system and estimated the electricity generation potential of Firle waste 
water treatment plant (treating a volume of 90ML a day) as 900 kW. A cost analysis showed that Microbial Fuel 
Cells could be competitive as a sustainable and energy-efficient technology for municipal wastewater treatment.

1. Introduction  
Energy is fast becoming the requirement of every individual on Earth, however with the increasing demand for 
energy mainly electricity, there is need for sustainable sources of energy. The past decades have seen evolution from 
use of fossil fuels to date were renewables are being adopted to counter the effects of the former in the past years by 
reducing emission of greenhouse gases. Faced with the challenge of creating more energy in a more sustainable 
manner this has seen some modifications in our way of living and hence the shift towards renewable energy, the 
science of Renewable energy is now an important area of research for social, health, environmental and economic 
reasons (Kumar, 2020). 
 
One interesting approach would be to use waste to generate the much needed energy. Just as the food humans 
consume contains a lot of energy, so does the waste produced as a result (Hong , 2020). Since the early 1900’s 
scientists have known that bacteria can produce electricity with the first report that bacteria can generate electricity 
by Potter having appeared almost a hundred years ago (Potter, 1911). Back then this was not fully embraced but the 
recent years have seen the need to further investigate and embrace the energy that can be generated from bacteria 
more.

A capacitor-based circuit is used to harvest the electrical energy from the Microbial Fuel Cell system. The circuit 
was made up of capacitors and relays controlled by a programmable microcontroller. The Microbial Fuel Cells 
charge the capacitors, when charged the capacitors are connected to power the pump, aerator, electric motors used in 
the waste treatment plant. 
 
5 Conclusions and Future Research  
This current work assumes that alcohol, chemical, disinfectant, bleaches or cleaners in the wastewater stream do not 
adversely affect the electricity producing bacteria found in the waste water, rather this work anticipates that the 
waste water contains many electricity producing bacteria. From this work it has been shown that it is feasible to 
adopt Microbial Fuel Cell system at an industrial scale but the technology still has several limitations, assumptions 
and challenges that must be addressed before broad adaptation is possible. One critical problem hindering the large 
scale application of Microbial Fuel Cell system is its high capital cost, which mainly arises from the expensive 
construction materials. Reducing the capital cost can be achieved by using highly efficient, scalable and less-
expensive anode, cathode and reactor materials. Carbonaceous materials are more favourable because they are 
cheaper, they have a big surface area that maintains a large ratio of electrode surface against reactor volume and is 
compatible with the exoelectrogens bacterial growth in the anode making a good cost-effective option. Managing 
power output is another critical issue in the scaling up of Microbial Fuel Cells as to date there is no way to 
efficiently harvest the electrical energy produced in the microbial fuel cell. Electrodes that contain current collectors 
can be considered for effective current collection.  It is difficult for an MFC to directly support a practical load, even 
at the maximum power generating point, due to the low voltage and current level. Thus, a power management 
system is needed to be incorporated into MFCs to make the energy feasible for powering electrical devices.

Abstract 
 
This article analyses how Indonesia as World Trade Organization Member State, may utilize and apply Trade Policy 
Review Mechanism’s Review Outcome to prevent dispute settlement in the Dispute Settlement Body. This article 
consists of two legal issues, the first issues discuss how Indonesia may utilize the TPRM Review Outcome to 
prevent dispute in DSB Appellate Body. Meanwhile, the second issues discuss how Indonesia may apply the TPRM 
Review Outcome to prevent such dispute settlement. By applying Indonesia v. Brazil Dispute concerning Indonesia 
Measures on Brazil Chicken Meat and Chicken Product Case as this article’s minor premise, writers may explain 
how TPRM Review Outcome may provide an individual well to Indonesia as the WTO Member States and may 
represent WTO’s Common Will to achieve free trade. Furthermore, writers also explain how Indonesia may apply 
the TPRM Review Outcome which is by conducting bilateral cooperation with Brazil. This cooperation shall 
Indonesia conducted by involving Indonesia National Consumer Protection Agency as one of its technical 
negotiation teams and Indonesia Halal Product Assurance Agency as one of its operational negotiation teams. 
Furthermore, this cooperation shall also entail measures that abolish Indonesia’s quantitative restriction measure or 
safeguard policy application.

6. Conclusion 
In concluding the first legal issue analysis writers would like to express that Indonesia shall utilize WT/TPR/S/401 
to prevent a dispute settlement process occur in DSB Appellate Body. This premise is expressed by writers since 
TPRM Report may provide an individual good for Indonesia as WTO Member State and to protect Indonesia’s 
national consent. And this utilization may also represent WTO General Will to achieve free trade. Indonesia shall 
also utilize WT/TPR/S/401 since dispute settlement through DSB has a long period, Indonesia measures have 
breached Annex 1A WTO Agreement and International Trade Law Principle within the WTO Agreement, Indonesia 
has obstacles in settling the dispute in DSB and Indonesia might lose its free trade advantages.  
To conclude the second legal issue analysis writers would like to state that Indonesia shall apply WT/TPR/S/401 to 
show its good faith in conducting the WTO Agreement. This application can be realized by conducting bilateral 
cooperation with Brazil in determining their halal standard on their agriculture products. While conducting this 
cooperation, Indonesia shall involve its National Consumer Protection Agency to help Indonesia’s technical 
negotiation team and it shall also involve its Halal Product Assurance Agency to help its operational negotiation 
team. This bilateral cooperation shall also be entailed with the invoking measure that abolishes Indonesia’s 
quantitative restriction measure or invoking the safeguarding policy.

Abstract 
 
Postharvest bambara nut processing operations were assessed in this study to address all factors constraining 
effective utilization of this unique crop. It involved review of existing records and empirical observations of its 
native and present day semi-mechanized processing systems.  Results revealed milling and sieving as the 
postharvest operations that are yet to be successfully addressed by the existing mechanized systems. This is caused 
by lack of inherent crack in seed coat of bambara grain and high binding force between its coat and endosperm due 
to its 205.92mg/100g (2.06g/Kg) phenolic compound content. The binding strength of this grain was deduced from 
records as 1.51 Mpa and used to determine the minimum pressure required for effective separation of the endosperm 
(food flour) and coat (chaff) of ground bambara grain as 7812.5Pa. These findings were applied in the development 
of a viable single flow milling-sieving machine for bambara flour production which improved hygiene, reduced 
drudgery and food loss in this sector.

1.Introduction 
Bambara ground nut is a crop with a high potential for the attainment of food security and poverty alleviation in 
Nigeria and Africa at large, as it shows considerable drought resistance and potentially high nutritional qualities 
(Yusuf et al.,2008; Atoyebi et al., 2017). Its seed shown in figure 1 is a complete balanced food because of adequate 
iron, protein, ash, fat, fibre, potassium, sodium, calcium, carbohydrate, oil and energy content (Atoyebi et al., 2017). It 
has superlative best worth protein content plus lysine which complements cereals in diets unlike other grains. 
According to Jagdev (2018), the seed is rich in beneficial bacteria known also as probiotics, milk from bambara seed is 
used for therapeutic purposes in diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome.  
 
 
 
Figure. 1: Structure of bambara seed 
Although bambara seed can be eaten as vegetable in its freshly raw green grains form, as snack when boiled with salt 
and pepper or roasted dry seeds, processing of the bambara grain to flour is vital for its diverse applications in 
diets/beverages preparation such as fufu, relish, soup/stew, Moi–Moi (Okpa), water yam pudding (Ojojo), milk,

1644","Comparative performance analysis of the bambara nut milling-sieving machine with the semi-mechanized system as 
shown in table 1 gives the throughput and the extraction efficiency for the bambara nut milling-sieving machine and 
the semi- mechanized system at a given bambara nut feed rate. At an average feed rate of 4.8kg, throughput and 
extraction efficiency of the bambara nut milling-sieving machine gives an average result of 117.8kg/h and 98.45% 
respectively while the semi-mechanized method gives 41.15kg/h and 83.7% as the average throughput and 
efficiency respectively. From the table it can be deduced that increase in feed rate also means increase in throughput 
and extraction efficiency for fully mechanized system while increase in feed rate means decrease in throughput and 
unstable extraction efficiency for semi-mechanized system this is because as human drudgery and fatigue comes to 
play after working for a giving time it tends to reduce the efficiency of the output as the feed rate is increased. But 
for the bambara nut milling-sieving machine, drudgery and fatigue is not witnessed at any time. Therefore the 
integrated bambara nut milling- sieving machine is seen to have the capacity to improve proper milling and sieving 
as well as revenue generation in the sector. It also reduces drudgery and eliminates time wastage and excessive loss 
of bambara flour associated with the semi-mechanized method. Bambara nut milling-sieving machine boost efficient 
production and recovery of quality bambara flour which in turn will eliminate the major problem of drudgery, 
fatigue, time wastage, poor efficiency and effectiveness of processing of bambara seed into fine flour for poverty 
alleviation and food security (Table 1) 
 
Table 1: Comparative performance analysis of the novel integrated milling-sieving machine and existing semi-
mechanized system for bambara flour production. 
 
 
5. Conclusion  
The bambara grain contain phenolic compounds amounting to 205.92mg/100g (2.06g/Kg) which bonds its nutritive 
tissue (endosperm) and seed coat with a maximum strength of 1.51 per MPa. Thus the binding force of the bambara 
seed was determined as 7284.38Pa per unit mass as a result a higher separating force is required to overcome the 
bond. Therefore 7812.5Pa which represent the total pressure of the cross beaters that is the pressure required to 
overcome the binding force of the seed and separate these two materials (flour content and chaff) is capable of 
overcoming the binding force of the seed coat and the cotyledon   Thus, the bambara nut milling-sieving machine 
enables effective processing and utilization of bambara groundnut. Thereby, reducing drudgery and fostering mass 
production of quality bambara flour which also will reposition this world most underutilized legume for mitigating 
future food shortage in sub-Saharan region.

Abstract 
 
PT. Semen Padang is the first cement company in Indonesia, established on March 18, 1910. To produce raw 
materials into finished materials, PT. Semen Padang uses three main machines: raw mill, kiln mill, and cement mill. 
To achieve the production target, PT. Semen Padang must have a machine that is qualified in operation. Therefore, 
proper maintenance of critical machinery in PT. Semen Padang. One of the critical machines that need maintenance 
is the raw mill machine. If the raw mill machine is damaged and causes the termination of the operating process, 
other machines will also not be able to operate. Therefore, maintenance is carried out on the critical components of 
the raw mill 4R1 indarung IV machine. To solve the problem with PT. Semen Padang planned treatment scheduling 
using Monte Carlo simulation, where this method is simulated by random number generation. The strategy proposed 
in the Monte Carlo simulation uses two scenarios, namely corrective maintenance and MTTF. The study results are 
the right maintenance strategies for raw mill machines and separators are preventive maintenance, and for boom side 
reclaimer machines that are corrective maintenance.

1. Introduction  
The fast expansion of the industrial world requires a business to be more competent to compete effectively and 
efficiently. There are several methods for companies to improve their effectiveness and efficiency, one of which is 
through efforts to optimize facility operations and minimize losses due to equipment damage. Damage to equipment 
can result in the stop of production, resulting in the company's production losing track of the objective. To achieve 
maximum output, it is necessary to have equipment that operates at optimum efficiency. As a result, a well-planned 
schedule of equipment maintenance is essential. 
 
In general, equipment deterioration does not occur uniformly. As a result, each piece of equipment receives a unique 
level of care. There are three types of damaged equipment: mistreated, old equipment, and equipment that is affected 
by people. As a result, each piece of equipment requires specific treatment to increase performance, expand its life,

Abstract  
 
Indonesia is the sixth-largest producer of cocoa beans in the world. Cocoa is one of the plantation commodities that 
play an important role in Indonesia's economic development. A cocoa factory in central Java Indonesia is a producer 
of processed cocoa products and plays an important role in the distribution of cocoa beans in central Java Indonesia. 
However, the transportation management of cocoa bean distribution from sub-district collectors to cacao factories is 
not optimal. It is due to the shipments from suppliers being uncertain, the number of transportation modes of 
transportation is not fixed so that the allocation of transportation capacity is not fulfilled, distribution times are not 
appropriate, and long distances to travel which resulted in waste of transportation costs. This study proposes an 
agent-based simulation model for a complex cocoa distribution process. This simulation is then carried out in several 
scenarios to get the optimization of the number of transportation modes and transportation costs.

1. Introduction 
Cacao trees can grow well in equatorial areas (Joshi, 2021) such as Indonesia because they have climate suitability 
as a place for growing and cultivating cacao plants. Cacao beans are the basic ingredients for making chocolate 
products (Fowler & Coutel, 2017) both in the form of drinks and food, and even beauty products (Beg, Ahmad, Jan, 
& Bashir, 2017). The better type of beans to produce good quality cocoa-based food and drink are fermented cocoa

1665","The results of the two simulated experiment scenarios, scenario experiment one was chosen as consideration for the 
cocoa factory. Scenario experiment 1 has a transportation mode utility value of 51%. The number of trucks 9 units is 
the most appropriate for the factory because in the observation system the number of trucks 12 units is still too many 
as some of them are not being used. It may interfere and can harm transportation costs for the company.  
The results of the calculation from the simulation of the transportation costs for the existing scenario, experiment 1 
and experiment 2 respectively are Rp. 65,679,700, Rp, 58,281,700, and Rp 66,081,700. The simulation results of 
scenario Experiment 1 obtained transportation costs of Rp. 58,281,700. Compared to the existing transportation 
costs of Rp. 65,679,700 there was a decrease in transportation costs by 11.264% or Rp. 7,398,000. These results are 
a reduction in expenses for the company and reduce the losses that occur. 
 
Comparison of the mileage obtained from the simulation of the existing scenario (blue line) with the simulation of 
the experimental scenario (red line), the distance efficiency is 4 km for each transport. The efficiency of this 
distance can be seen in the following Figure 8. The comparison of the travel time for the existing scenario is 89.7 
minutes at each transportation frequency, which is usually carried out at 4 frequencies per day when compared to the 
experimental conditions with a travel time of 60.9 minutes. There was a saving in travel time of 28.8 minutes per 
transportation frequency and increasing the transportation frequency to 5, with an increase in the frequency to 5 it 
will increase the number of cocoa beans being transported.

5. Conclusion 
There are 2 scenarios experiment that has been designed, namely in scenario experiment 1, the number of trucks was 
reduced by 3 units to 9 trucks and in scenario experiment 2, the number of trucks was increased by 3 units to 15 
trucks. The results of the comparison of utility values show that scenario experiment 1 has the highest utility value 
of 51% when compared to the scenario existing simulation of 41% and scenario experiment 2 of 32%. Therefore, 
scenario experiment 1 is preferred for the factory. There is a reduction in expenses for the company and reduce the 
losses incurred. The decrease in costs occurred by 11.264% with a nominal value of Rp. 7.398.000. There was a 
decrease in mileage traversed by trucks from 22.3 Km to 20.3 Km and a decrease in transportation time of 28.8

1. Introduction 
Various programs from the Ministry of Education and Culture continue to be rolled out. There are eight types of off-
campus learning activities that students can run, namely internships / work practices, humanitarian projects, student 
exchanges, building villages, entrepreneurial activities, research, Teaching / Teaching Assistance Campuses, and 
independent studies / projects (JPNN, 2021).  The rapid development of science and technology today, has brought a 
very rapid change in various aspects of life. Jobs and the way we work are changing, many jobs are being lost, while 
new types of jobs are popping up. Economic, social, and cultural changes are also happening at a high rate. In this 
very dynamic time, colleges must respond quickly and appropriately. It takes a transformation of learning to be able 
to equip and prepare higher education graduates to become a better generation. A generation that is responsive and 
ready to face the challenges of its time, without being uprooted from the cultural roots of its nation.

Abstract  
 
Several industries start focusing on the green concept in supply chain management (SCM) to reduce waste, emission 
and to preserve the quality of natural resources. However, it is still very difficult to understand and analyze the effect 
of individual activities of green supply chain and their corresponding contribution. Therefore, the purpose of this 
study is to investigate the impact of green supply chain management on organizational performance. This study is a 
conceptual review based on existing literatures in the area of green supply chain management. Efforts were made to 
examine the impact of reverse logistic, green procurement, green distribution as a component of GSCM on 
organizational performance in the area of manufacturing and logistics firms in Nigeria. Based on critical literature 
review conducted, the existing literature on the effects of green supply chain management practices on firm 
performance provides support for the idea that there is a positive relationship between GSCM practices and firm 
performance. They also enhance the understanding of how different types of GSCM practices are related to 
financial, operational and environmental performance in manufacturing and logistics. The empirical results suggest 
that while internal GSCM practices have the strongest effect on environmental performance, environmental 
collaboration with customers seems to be the most effective way to improve financial performance. In terms of 
operational performance, most findings were more mixed, suggesting that the operational performance of firms is 
more likely to be affected by firm characteristics than by the choices they make regarding their environmental 
collaboration.

1. Introduction  
The ecological balance is deteriorated by environmental challenges such as deforestation, environmental pollution, 
global warming and reduced biodiversity. Thus, this has necessitated development in manufacturing technology and 
increasing governmental regulations for environmental protection Goyal et al., (2017). As a result, green supply 
chain management (GSCM) makes a cognate effort to incorporate environmental issues in the context of supply 
chain management (Cousins et al., 2020). GSCM cut across the whole supply chain from suppliers, manufacturing 
companies, consumers, and also reverse logistics in a closed-loop supply chain (Abdallah, & Al-Ghwayeen, 2019).

4. Conclusion and Contributions 
From the review of the empirical studies, the study presents a theoretical framework for the reverse logistics 
outcomes of sustainable supply chain initiatives and organizational performance. The research hypotheses reflect 
input from a wide array 1of literature 1and the discussion 1of findings. Though the study identifies three 
components of sustainable supply chain, 1other components could exist, and ongoing research should investigate 
them. Therefore, the findings of this study will have important implications for managers in emerging markets 
seeking to initiate ecologically friendly business 1practices. The study will offer strong evidence of the benefits 
obtained from reverse logistics in sustainable supply chain 1initiatives. Policy makers 1and firms attempting to 
nurture sustainable supply chain initiatives should not overlook the important role of eco-reputation and eco-
innovation strategic orientations, which the results identify as important enablers. Therefore, this study will offer 
evidence of the critical role of eco-reputation and eco-innovation strategic orientations in deploying sustainable 
supply chain initiative programs, as 1well as of their mutual effects. This study will also offer empirical evidence 
that implementing sustainable supply chain initiatives leads to reverse logistics, creating value, and a new source of 
competitive advantages.

Abstract  
 
Late order loss for difficulty handling (loading and unloading) activities left an alarm message to make traditional 
transportation handling for distribution e-commerce more accessible through mitigating it to semi-auto actions. This 
article discusses the idea of Vehicle Containers made up of Permutational Drawers, i.e., VCPD, that ensure ergonomic 
handling. The proposed Ergonomic Digital Twin (EDT) manages the VCPD by the Internet of things, i.e., IoT. The 
VCPD object has two dimensions: drawers' size and motion mechanism. These targets are implemented via establishing 
the digital twins' model, i.e., DT, for these drawers to test its qualifying for implementation, mainly if supported by IoT. 
There is still much confusion regarding the DT and how it will apply to the VCPD in medium-sized schemes for 
transportation enterprises. This work activates the IoT to bolster and simplify transportation activities through designing 
VCPD and control via a unified framework having several standard steps to reduce execution time, effort, and 
transportation costs.

1. Introduction, Digital Twins in transportation 
The article hopes that digitalizing all transportation activities via the smart sensors platforms enhances the M2M 
interaction relationship. Digitalization must be aided by several recent technologies such as the Industrial Internet of 
Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and cloud computing (Ahmed M. Abed, 2020). Many 
researchers unanimously agree that a digital twin, an electronic replica of an organism, machine, parts thereof, or 
service (e.g., transportation is a service based on the organism) has four vertices (stakeholders, product, mechanism,

The digital twins are a future of development and control for transportation schemes to acquire adaptation skills 
(flexibility) to keep up with the VOC (i.e., the voice of customer) of satisfaction factors, whether the products or 
services are delivered in minimum time through distribution activities. The DT receives the VOC and/or stakeholders 
data fed to the IoT dataset to create a perception of steps to enhance and develop the designed product in its first 
generation schemes, discussed in Eqn. (1-24). Some of the indicators, such as the over-processing (waste) activities 
reduced by 27%, the average execution time of loading and unloading activities reduced by 40%, and the delivery time 
by 15%. The future of transportation lies in employing digital twins to increase serviceability for related KPI and cut 
expenses, which will become increasingly popular. By 2025, Up to 89% of all services must have their DT models 
controlled via IoT platforms in real-time. Nearly 36% of executives across various industries are aware of the benefits 
of digital twinning, with almost half aiming to implement it by 2028 (ASME, 2021). As time goes on, digital twin 
technology establishes itself as one of the essential software tools for changing product creation. The DT models are 
designed to study how to reduce the efforts, service time, service costs and increase the performance up to 59%, as 
shown in Table-5 (i.e., this value is different according to the studied case). Also, test, experiment, and develop the 
mechanism of the physical object to achieve the previous aims. The proposed EDT is ready to assume any inputs 
according to the use case to establish the presented object.

Abstract 
 
The link between economic performance and energy efficiency is a continuing debate. This paper investigates 
the long-term equilibrium and causal relationship between energy efficiency and GDP per capita in East African 
countries for the period between 1990 and 2021. The analysis of EAC countries do not provide clear evidence of 
convergence in the sense that poor economies tend to grow faster than rich ones in per capita terms. The co-
integration test indicates a long-run equilibrium relationship between GDP and energy intensity. In particular, 
the result based on Johansen shows that the energy intensity level of primary energy and GDP per capita are co-
integrated in Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda while the co-integration based on Pedroni occurs in Burundi and 
Rwanda. The Granger causality shows that there is a unidirectional relation running from GDP to primary 
energy use in all countries except Kenya. South Sudan is observed to have a bidirectional relationship between 
variables. Finally, we find that the long-run coefficient of GDP per capita is negative and significant, indicating 
a change in trend of energy intensity. The results suggest that economic growth in EAC countries can be 
supported by promoting growth in productivity of the energy industries.

1. Introduction 
Over the last decade, the ratio of people lacking access to modern energy services has fallen by 10%–down from 
almost 25%, even though the global population has expanded considerably. Referring to BP’s “Statistical 
Review of World Energy 2020”, energy based on coal accounts for 36% and occupies the first source of power 
generation in the world for the year 2019, the growth of carbon emissions has slowed but is still high. To 
process the world transition towards sustainable green and low carbon development by reducing dependency on 
fossil fuel in the short term has become very difficult. The traditional view about energy-saving policies seeks to 
make a trade-off between the stability of economic growth and to sustain the environment. To achieve green 
economy growth, long term development and improvement, some countries have set targets to achieve 
reductions by 2030 and making carbon emission neutrality by 2060 (Zhou et al. 2021). Energy efficiency plays a

ABSTRACT 
 
The use of internal combustion engines is a reliable and relatively efficient means of getting mechanical power for 
automotive propulsion and prime movers for generators in power plants. The transport sector is a major consumer of 
fossil fuels and accounts for over 60% of total air pollution coming from automobiles running on fossil fuels. In this 
study, an analysis was done on the feasibility of converting conventional engines to biogas or biomethane engines.  
The study showed that dual fuel engines can be used with little or no modifications to ran on biogas. However, to 
run on pure biogas as a fuel, the diesel engines need introduction of the ignition system in addition to gas storage 
and supply system. Conversion of a petrol engine to 100% biogas is the simplest as it requires minor adjustments 
related o introduction of the biogas storage and supply system.   
 
Keywords  
Biogas; biogas engine; engine performance; energy conservation; dual fuel engine, exhaust gas recirculation. 
 
1. Introduction 
The world is facing the challenge of growing energy demand with pressure on conventional energy sources which 
are mainly polluting fossil fuels and whose reserves are finite and diminishing (Singh and Layek 2019, These 
challenges and hence the need for sustainability in energy generation and use in an environmentally benign manner 
has created interest in biogas as an alternative fuel source for internal combustion engines (Kabeyi 2020, Kabeyi and 
Oludolapo 2020)..The concern over greenhouse gas emissions and global warming has led to demand for 
substitution of fossil fuels in powering internal combustion engines in transport and power generation (Ecotricity 
2019). With world population explosion and increased energy demand and growing pollution from fossil fuels, there 
is need to substitute petrol and diesel in powering automobiles because their exhausts account for over 60% of total 
atmospheric pollution (Mitzlaff 1988) Biogas is particularly significant because of possibility of use in internal 
combustion engines, which are the main power source for transport vehicles and also commonly used for powering 
of generators in diesel power plants. This possibility of use is justified by biogas properties, which make it 
convenient for internal combustion engines (Awogbemi and Sunday 2015). A spark ignition engine running on a 
blend of biogas and petrol is more economical, less polluting and has lower fuel consumption. 
 
  Biogas is a mixture of gases produced by anaerobic digestion of biomass or biodegradable organic wastes in a 
controlled environment and process. The main constituents of biogas are methane and carbon dioxide, with methane 
being the main determinant of the energy potential of biogas (Adeyemo and Babatunde 2015), Diesel and petrol  
powered engines have their limitations such as high emissions, low efficiency and high costs (Senthilkumar K.and 
Vivekanandan, 2020), There are many advantages of biogas, but it is not so popular because of high NOx emission 
in some applications. In order to reduce NOx emission from the engine, it is necessary to keep max out combustion 
temperature under control. EGR technique is one of the methods to reduce NOx emission as it enables lesser flame 
temperature and oxygen concentration in combustion chamber. The main pollutants from biogas combustion are 
CO, HC, NOx, PM, and soot, etc. with NOx being the most   injurious component of the exhaust emissions 
 
  The main challenge of converting a petrol/diesel engine is the reduction in rating of the engine, increased 
hydrocarbon emissions (Kabeyi. and Oludolapo 2020). Additionally biogas has a longer ignition delay which means 
that at the end of combustion stroke, burning is still going own which can cause high exhaust gas temperature,

From table 3 above, it is noted that between natural gas, oil and coal, natural gas produces the least total emissions 
followed by oil and coal respectively. It produces 82.7% less total emissions than coal and 44.4 less total emission 
than oil.   Since natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel, it can be used in many applications to reduce the negative 
environmental impact of fossil fuel combustion. The use of natural gas in power generation reduces cases of fog 
since it leads to less NOx emissions which is the main cause of smog. Acid rain whose principal sources SO2 and 
NOx is also reduced by use of natural gas in place of oil and coal since natural gas emits almost no SO2 and emits up 
to 80% less NOx than coal (Munde et l., 2012). A shift from coal and oil to natural gas will significantly reduce 
pollution from power plants since power generation is a leader in greenhouse gas emissions, example in 2002, power 
generation accounted for 67% of Sulphur dioxide emissions, 40% of CO2 emissions, 25% of NOx emissions, and 
34% of mercury emissions in the US because coal fired powerplants have a significant contribution to generation 
capacity. It can also be noted that natural gas  combined cycle powerplant emit about 50%  as much  CO2 as modern  
super critical coal power plant. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 The results of this study showed that biogas is a feasible substitute of fossil fuel as an alternative fuel, but 
conversion should be carefully done to minimize engine emission like NOx, CO, particulate matter, and others. The 
use of a heat exchanger in the EGR system resulted in reduction of emissions in the atmosphere. The use of the EGR 
in improved thermal efficiency and is eco-friendly but optimum level of recirculation should be established for 
tradeoff between NOX and other emissions which are influenced differently.  The modification of diesel engine into 
a dual fuel engine would involve introducing an air-fuel mixing chamber along the air intake system to provide an 
effective means of admitting the gaseous fuel into the combustion chamber and for homogenous mixing of air and 
the gaseous fuel. A modification has also to be made at the diesel injection pump to allow adjustment of the 
injection quantities of the pilot fuel as may be necessary. The study showed that brake power and the brake thermal 
efficiency decreased with use of biogas due to the calorific value of biogas being lower compared to diesel. The 
lower heating value of biogas is at least 50% lower than for diesel. Both CO and HC emissions of the dual fuel 
engine are  higher  than for diesel operation by upto 2 and 12 times respectively. This was majorly attributed to 
displacement of the air necessary for combustion with biogas. Biogas is a good fuel for dual fuel engines and can 
form a perfect supplement to the fossil fuels used in the country since it is renewable and affordable. Biogas can also 
be used alone but adjustment  to the engine  may be necessary depending on whether the engine is compression 
ignition or spark ignition.  
 
This study demostrated that a petrol and biogas-petrol blend yield  higher torque, more brake power, higher 
indicated power, high brake thermal efficiency, and higher brake mean effective pressure. But, it has  lower fuel 
consumption and creates higher  exhaust temperature than petrol. The stufy showed that  a spark ignition engine 
fueld by biogas-petrol  was more  economical, ha has low fuel consumption and contributes to  to fertilizer 
production and better sanitation. Therfore biogas has a significant role to place in the energy transition by cutting 
down emissions in bothe power generation and transport indiustry.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to present an “Self-Help” alternative approach to developing, building, managing and 
maintaining of campus infrastructures, facilities and amenities in Nigerian Universities and integrating facilities 
management, operations and maintenance as part of the engineering education. Currently, Nigerian Universities 
follows the traditional method of infrastructures and facilities management. Most campuses around the country have 
delipidated dormitories, and campus roads are in terrible and debilitated conditions. Most campuses lack running water 
in the dormitories, libraries, offices and laboratories. Student have to walk down two to three stories to fetch water for 
their use. There is chronic and persistent shortage of electricity supply on campuses. In many universities across the 
country, students residing on campuses experience up to five days without electricity and had to rely on kerosine 
lamps for studying. In a country like Nigeria, this should be unacceptable in the 21st century because it hinders student 
learning and impedes campus growth and improvement. This approach centers on utilizing the services of students to 
lead operations, management and maintenance of infrastructures and facilities. The expected outcome is to maintain 
24 hours electricity and water supply, environmentally safe dormitories and recreation areas, and clean classrooms, 
offices, and landscaping.

1. Introduction  
Many studies have shown that infrastructure resources required for production of effective education processes are in 
short supply in Nigerian Universities (Subnair et al, 2012). This study is important, not because it is a study about a 
new area of study, but because if the suggestions from this study are implemented in university campuses across the 
country, the problems and issues of delipidated infrastructures, facilities and amenities would be greatly reduced to a 
minimum or totally eliminated. Electricity and water supply will be improved and the epileptic power outages will be 
a thing of the past and quality of life for the students, staff, and the surrounding environment will be improved. Also, 
executing this strategy, will help in solving most of the infrastructure and facilities problems facing higher institutions 
in the country. Though, this is not a scientific study, but a study based on observations and interactions with past and 
current students at University of Nigeria Nsuka, University of Lagos, University of Port Harcourt, University of Abuja, 
University of Science and Technology Port-Hacourt, Abia State University, Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, 
University of Calabar and University of Benin. To my surprise, these students provided similar narratives regarding 
the pitiful state of infrastructures, amenities, and facilities in their respective institutions (See Figures 1, 2 and 3). 
These pictures in the figures below attest to the severe decay in infrastructures, this is an indictment to a leadership 
that does not care for the welfare of the students and the university at large. Universities are responsibility for 
developing future leaders, both in the technical and non-technical areas. Universities helps to drive technological 
development and social changes as the infrastructure for performing various functions such as education, research, 
and community service and the  universities role to foster social responsibility and develop human resources required

1730",,"program, outside hires, training professors and lecturers as well as consultants that may be engaged in the program. 
Once the program is set up and running, it will pay for itself because preventive and predictive maintenance saves 
money and helps to increase the life of old facilities and prevent wasting resources to build new facilities that may not 
be needed. The university may no longer have the need to hire outside contractors for some certain projects because 
the students and staff can do the work at lower cost with better quality outcomes. For students from less economically 
viable homes and others, it could be a means of earning money on campus and using it to offset some expenses 
including tuition and fees. The students will obtain the practical experience they need to lead projects in the areas of 
Power generation, distribution and transmission, water purification and delivery to facilities, design and construction 
of campus roads and bridges, preventive and predictive maintenance of infrastructures and facilities, as well as 
construction and maintenance of new buildings, parks and recreation centers.  Minting out new engineering graduates 
that do not have the proper tools to execute engineering projects may be responsible for Nigeria’s dependency on 
foreign trained engineers for design and development of the country’s infrastructure and facilities needs.  With this 
approach, graduating engineers will acquire the critical and practical skills and experience they need to become 
productive and viable. The phenomenon of no real-life experience that makes graduating engineers disadvantaged 
when compared with their foreign counterparts will be eliminated. They will gain technological and infrastructural 
development, operations, management and maintenance experience and their understanding of what maintenance 
culture means will be greatly enhanced. The issue of unemployment would be reduced as they will become employable 
to the hiring companies. These engineers will gain the confidence to take over and lead maintenance of the 
infrastructures and facilities built by expatriate that left the country long after the projects were completed.    
 
6. Recommendations   
Facilities, infrastructure and amenities management, operations, maintenance and sustainment are very critical for 
maintaining a healthy environment and good quality of life on campus and its surroundings. Based on my findings, I 
would recommend the following: 
 Executing continuous improvement strategies for infrastructures, facilities and amenities within the 
university campuses and the surrounding communities 
 
 Anchor the campus infrastructures, facilities, and amenities development strategy around utilizing 
engineering students, lecturers and professors to research, develop, design, build, launch, operate, manage, 
maintain and sustain for the purpose of support quality of campus life and its surrounding communities. 
 
 Develop strategies for encouraging engineering and operations management students to learn the skills 
needed to operate, manage, maintain and lead real life projects, and employees to deliver tangible results.  
 
 Integrate these projects into the academic curriculum which will help in sustaining and improving 
infrastructures within and around the campus environment, its surroundings and the country at large. 
 
 Work with college of management to integrate management education into engineering education and start 
the creation of a maintenance culture starting from the university campuses and cascade across the country.   
 
 Integrate student led projects for developing, building operating, managing and maintaining electricity and 
water treatment and purification plants, solar energy, wind and gas-powered energy with emphasis for 24-
hour uninterrupted electricity supply and water delivery directly to all campus facilities.   
 
 Introduce fund raising department as part of the infrastructure, facilities and amenities development and 
sustainment program. The purpose is to raise funds from alumni and the general public including from 
businesses on a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis for funding campus infrastructure and facilities projects.

Abstract   
 
Sudden cardiac arrest is unexpected, which can be fatal. Providing quick assistance to patients with the automated 
external defibrillator (AED) can reduce the risk of loss and increase the chances of survival. The objective of this 
research is to determine the optimal location of the automated external defibrillator in Muang Prachinburi district, 
which located in eastern part of Thailand. There are severe conditions which can be developed to sudden cardiac arrest 
such as severe trauma, acute cardiac arrest, respiratory disease and stroke. The maximal covering location problem 
(MCLP) is applied to find the location of electrical defibrillators based on the dispersion of incidences in need of 
urgent assistance in 2017. For disease distribution, top most incidences were in Na Mueng, Ban Phra and Dongkeelek 
sub districts. The largest increase in the number of diseases from 2015 to 2017 include strokes and heart attack account 
for approximately 27.75% and 24.26%, respectively. The number of emergency critical cases increase spreading to 
the center of urban area.  From the result, the maximal coverage with 40 AEDs within 2 km. is approximately 90.09% 
of coverage.

1. Introduction   
A number of fast track that emergency medical care is needed in diverse circumstances, including cardiac arrest, major 
trauma, stroke and sudden cardiac arrest. Emergency patient assistance is an important step, especially by providing 
quick-accessible defibrillators. If help is delayed by one minute, there will be a 7% lower chance of survival. Current 
traffic conditions affect the travel of emergency rescue vehicle units in patient lead to hospitalized patients, especially 
sudden cardiac arrest patients. Dangerous atrial fibrillation can occur at any time. Urgent treatment is required. When 
an emergency occurs, CPR can help the patient's blood system circulate to the brain if the patient is stimulated by an 
automated external defibrillator (AED). Treat the illness immediately by shocking an electric defibrillator during 
which emergency rescue vehicles have not yet arrived, reducing the impact of the arrival distance of emergency rescue 
vehicles and increasing the chances of survival. The allocation of emergency medical service (EMS) resources and 
tools to cover the distribution of critical illness groups, likely to require emergency assistance, is an urgent need.

5. Conclusion   
The location of the automatic defibrillators (AEDs) in Muang Prachinburi district, Prachinburi province consists of 
13 subdivisions in accordance with the distribution of 5 emergency crisis diseases. In 2017, there were 2,095 cases, 
the highest number of diseases ever recorded, including severe trauma, respiratory diseases, sudden cardiac arrest, and 
stroke. The areas where the most disease occurs are Na Muang sub district, Ban Phra sub district, and Dongkeelek sub 
district. Diseases with the highest increase in the number of cases from 2015 include strokes and heart attacks, 
accounting for about 27.75% and 24.26%, respectively. The maximal coverage with 40 AEDs within 2 km. is 
approximately 90.09% of coverage.

Abstract 
The plastic recycling industry in Indonesia only fill 82% of national need. Plastic recycling industries around Jakarta 
have a capacity of 80% of their ability. In failure to achieve production capacity this article aims to increase production 
achievement by the VSM approach. By investigating a plastic recycling industry in Bogor with about 320 Kg/hour 
production from 400 Kg/hour capacity this study aims to improve the production by focusing on pelletizing. The 
process consists of five sub-process cello injection pelletizing, cutting, drying, filter, and blower. Improvement 
focused on two sub-processes with less value sub-cutting with 64.69 minutes and sub process drying with 64.00 to 
400 kg. This action reduced the time by 64.69 minutes to 62 minutes. Meanwhile, in the drying sub-process, 
improvement from the length of the drying process, then it is corrected by increasing the temperature of the vibrator 
to reduce the bottleneck from 64 minutes to 62 minutes.

1. Introduction 
In 2016, The global plastic recycling market worldwide was increasing was valued at USD 34,804.1 million and it 
will reach USD 50,356.1 million by 2022, with a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 6.4% (Industry 2022). 
The growth of the global plastic recycling market is increasing the use of recycled plastic instead of buying virgin 
plastic. Plastics can also cause severe environmental pollution caused by using used plastic waste in the sea and 
landfills in many countries. Many industries increase using plastic recycling such as packaging, automotive, electrical, 
and electronics industries. They took initiatives to support the use of plastic recycling worldwide by offering profitable 
opportunities for the growth of the plastic recycling market. The prospects of the market in plastics showed a vast 
increment, as Figure 1 below showed.

After eliminating processes that do not have added value in the Pellet Machine Process (WS-4), namely cutting and 
drying processes, the achievement value against the ideal time is 96%, increasing 95%. Although the value of 1% is 
only 2 minutes, this has a vast impact on the balance of production in the Pellet Machine Process and on the overall 
process, which changes the bottleneck time from 75.00 minutes to 64.69 Minutes in the pellet machine process. The 
improvement is focused again on the cutting sub-process. And drying, which finally became 63.13 minutes, because 
the cello sub-process injection became the biggest bottleneck in the pelleting process. 
 
5.1 Numerical Results 
1. Identified the biggest bottelneck in the pelleting process on the cutting and drying sub-process with 
bottlenecks of 64.69 minutes and 64.00 minutes. 
2. After eliminating processes that do not have added value in the Pellet Machine Process (WS-4), namely 
cutting and drying processes, the achievement value against the ideal time is 96%, increasing 95%. 
3. Although the value of 1% is only 2 minutes, this has a vast impact on the balance of production in the Pellet 
Machine Process and on the overall process, which changes the bottleneck time from 75.00 minutes to 64.69 
Minutes in the pellet machine process. 
4. The improvement is focused again on the cutting sub-process. And drying, which finally became 63.13 
minutes, because the cello sub-process injection became the biggest bottleneck in the pelleting process. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the description of the research analysis, the most unbalanced points in the plastic recycling production line 
at PT PAM are Crusher Process Machines and Press Machines, which have bottleneck values of 75 and 72.73 Minutes 
in producing 400 kg. The inability of the Crusher and Press Machine based on the Focus Group Discussion (FGD), 
experts, financial assessment, and field observations, investment in replacement was made to reduce potential losses 
so that the most significant bottleneck lies in the pelletizing process with a bottleneck of 64.69 minutes. The focus of 
improvement in this study is to reduce the non-value-added sub-process in the Pelletizing Process with the VSM 
approach to reduce the time of 64.69 minutes. 
 
This research applied the VSM approach to the workflow of several sub-processes of the WS-4 Pellet Process. Sub- 
processes that have less added value are sub-cutting with 64.69 minutes and 64.00 to produce 400 kg. By replacing 
the layer with a new one every 4 hours, reduce the time by 64.69 minutes to 62 minutes in the sub-cutting process. 
Meanwhile, in the drying sub-process, improvement comes from the length of the drying process, then it is corrected 
by increasing the temperature of the vibrator to reduce the bottleneck from 64 minutes to 62 minutes.

Abstract 
  
The purpose of this research is to calculate the valuation of coal mining projects, especially low-calorie coal using the 
Real Option and Discounted Cash Flow methods for comparison. Research has been carried out in PT. Pesona 
Khatulistiwa Nusantara (PT.PKN), which one has low-calorie coal reserves in four mining areas, and currently has 
production in two mining areas. At the opening of the two previous sites, the feasibility calculation was carried out 
using the Discounted Cash Flow method, which this method did not describe the movement of coal prices that occurred 
in the future so that management was not flexible in setting strategies to dealing with fluctuating coal prices. Where 
in that period there was a continuous decline in coal prices from 2011 to 2016. Currently PT. PKN plans to open a 
new mining area, namely at the Ardimulyo Mine Operation (AMO) site, to get a more detailed analysis the valuation 
of this AMO project will be calculated using Real Option to accompany the calculation with discounted cash flow. 
The calculation using the real option method (without abandon) shows the NPV value below the discounted cash flow 
method, while the exit option/abandonment value increases as the selling price of coal decreases. So it is recommended 
to run an exit option/abandonment when the selling price of coal is not economical.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia has been a leading exporter of thermal coal since 2005. The portion of thermal coal exported consists of 
medium quality types (between 5100 and 6100 cal/gram) and low quality types (below 5100 cal/gram), most are export 
to China and India . Indonesia has 2.2% of the total global coal reserves, according to the BP Statistical Review of 
World Energy, around 60% of the total coal reserves in Indonesia consist of low quality coal (sub-bituminous). 
 
PT. Pesona Khatulistiwa Nusantara (PT.PKN) is a coal mining company, specifications in low-calorie coal mining. 
PT. PKN has low calorie coal reserves (3,000 – 5,000 cal/gram, the majority of reserves are around 3000 cal/gram). 
PT.PKN has four mining site, started mining operations since 2009 at the KMO site, and started mining operations at 
the SMO site in early 2012, when the SMO site started operating the decline in coal commodity prices happen 
continuously until the end of 2016. And the operational still running during that periode and generate loss. There was 
an increase in coal prices after 2016 – 2019 but cannot cover losses incurred from previous years. 
 
Investment feasibility studies or company financial projections use the Discounted Cash flow (DCF) method, where 
the reference coal price and projected costs will always escalate every year and a constant discount rate every year,

The stand-by cost of contractor units is the largest portion of the exit option/abandonment fee. In this study, the cost 
refers to the mining contract on the existing site, assuming the terms of the AMO mining contract will be the same as 
the contract. Assuming how to run the options as follows: 
1. Observation of the movement of the selling price of coal for a maximum of 6 months, after the price is 
confirmed not to improve, the company run terminates. 
2. The cost of terminating the contractor's employee contract will be covered by the company, as well as the 
cost of re-recruitment if the company is still using the same contractor when running its production again. 
3. Employee costs only accommodate the needs of contractors, for PT. PKN employees it is assumed that if 
there is a site closure, employees can be allocated to another sites, so there are no costs for PT. PKN 
employees. 
 
Another scheme for the stand-by costs of this contractor's equipment is the company can bear the cost of leasing 
contractor equipment along with the basic salary of employees who are laid off on a monthly basis. Where these costs 
must be agreed at the beginning of the contract. Seeing that the production scale of the AMO site is relatively small 
and currently in preparation for production and sales, it is very possible to prepared this Exit Option/Abandonment if 
faces the coal price reduction. In order to carry out this strategy, it can be prepared at the beginning of the project 
setup. Relating to the costs that will arise if carrying out the Exit Option/Abandonment must be considered more 
carefully, especially those related to mining contractor contracts. The strategy for carrying out Exit 
Option/Abandonment at the AMO site can be arranged at the stage of drafting a contract with the contractor (related 
to costs for stand-by equipment while still paying attention to a win-win solution between the Company and the 
Contractor). And the fulfillment of Human Resources can maximize several positions filled by workers from the labor 
supply. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From the results of the research on the production scenario set by PT.PKN, it produces NPV (DCF) : $7,576,503, 
NPV (RO without abandon) : $5,266,160, NPV (RO with abandon) : $12,319,932, and the value of Option 
exit/Abandonment : $7,053,771. The difference in NPV between the option with abandon and without abandon is the 
value of the Exit Option/Abandonment, where there is potential for additional NPV if there is a delay in production 
and sales when the selling price of coal is not economical. However, there are limitations in carrying out this Exit 
Option/Abandonment practice, where companies that have run production are not flexible in exercising this option 
because there are costs that will arise when running it. These costs must be considered when choosing to exercise this 
option. 
 
This research is limited to the calculation of feasibility using real options methode and estimated costs to exercise the 
exit/abandonment option when the selling price of coal is not economical, which this study discusses only the planning 
stage. The execution stage of running the exit option/abandonment has not been discussed in this study, it is hoped 
that further research can detail the stages of execution and evaluation.

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the dynamics involved in the determination of capital structure of banks in 
Indonesia. The results of this study show that that depending on the leverage measurement (book or market) various 
independent variables on the capital structure determinant of Indonesia Banking. The results of the regression models 
show that profitability is positively related to leverage uniform across both, leverage measures. Firm size is positively 
related to leverage uniform across both, leverage measures. Collateral is positively related to leverage uniform across 
both, leverage measures. Non-debt tax shield is negatively related to leverage uniform across both, leverage measures. 
Furthermore, as expected uniform relationship between Tobin’s Q is observed for market leverage and Tier 1 Capital 
is observed for book leverage. The positive relationship between Tobin’s Q and book leverage is not in line with our 
expectations and the positive relationship between Tier 1 Capital and market leverage. Overall, our panel regression 
results tend to suggest that the determinants under study are reliable in explaining bank capital structure. Additionally, 
based on the results above, in terms of the coefficient sign and significance, the financing decision of bank, both are 
better explained by the Pecking Order Theory and by the Trade-Off Theory, respectively.

Abstract 
 
The turnover intention for employees is one of the important issues for the company. Therefore, various parties or 
stakeholders in the company are trying to find out more about the factors that encourage employees to stop working. 
In addition to the company's internal parties, many researchers want to study further about the reasons why employees 
stop working. This research also aims to examine four factors that can affect the intensity of employees to stop 
working, namely work stress, workload, organizational environment, and leadership style. The method used in this 
regression research is a quantitative method with linear model analysis. In addition, this research tested 119 employees 
of NPE companies through a questionnaire. Based on the results of data analysis on the four variables, there is only 
one variable that has a significant effect on the intensity of employees to stop working, namely work stress. The third 
variable has no significant effect on the intensity to stop working. Meanwhile, the variables of leadership style and 
organizational environment are negatively correlated with the intensity of employees to stop working.

1. Introduction  
The high employee turnover rate is an intriguing challenge that practitioners and academics in different countries 
should investigate further. Various statistical data on the rate of quitting work or turnover have raised questions about 
this occurrence. As an example, job turnover in the United States is regarded as a global employment issue. Voluntary 
turnover (a measure of an employee's willingness or ability to leave a job) was 2.1 million in April 2012, up from 1.8 
million in June 2009. 
 
From the human resource management standpoint, a high degree of intention to quit employment is a serious concern 
for various reasons. For starters, high turnover rates have financial ramifications. When employees depart, new staff 
must be recruited, selected, and trained. Furthermore, replacing a full-time private-sector employee could cost 25% of 
their total yearly income. Secondly, staff turnover may have a negative impact on productivity and performance, 
particularly in crucial roles within the firm. Therefore, many studies have started to determine the causes in 
organizations that cause employee turnover (Chory & Westerman, 2009).

Abstract  
 
Fossil fuel is increasingly used in vehicles such as Buses and Trucks. Fossil fuels are also used in the manufacturing 
and energy sectors to generate electricity. The use of fossil fuels would increase Greenhouse gases, which will badly 
affect the environment. Many researchers have been proposing methods and schemes to protect the domain from the 
effect of greenhouse gases. This article has made an effort to study the use of LNG as fuel for vehicles such as Buses 
and Trucks. The main objective of this research work is (i) to explore the use of LNG as fuel for Buses and Trucks. 
(i) Operational viability (iii) Economic viability (iv) Safety and Security aspects. The article concludes that using LNG 
as fuel for vehicles such as Buses and Trucks will significantly reduce the emission of Greenhouse gases and thereby 
minimize the destruction of the environment.

1. Introduction  
Over the years, increased greenhouse gas emissions have been causing significant concern in many countries around 
the globe. Greenhouse gases (Figure 1) include CO2, SO2, CO, CH4, etc. Nearly 99% of Global transportation is 
carried out using Internal combustion (IC) engines (Felix Leach 2020). These IC engines use liquid fuels such as 
Petrol or Diesel. Environmental sustenance is the main goal set by the United Nations. Despite designing policies by 
the government to protect the environment from the emission of Greenhouse gases, many efforts are not giving 
significant results. With global warming is on the rise, tons of ice are getting melted, climatic variations including 
unexpected rainfall and violent floods, etc. The variation in climatic conditions also causes pandemics, significantly 
affecting society. These floods are so severe that they drive economic destruction and result in the loss of life. Thus, 
it is clear that fossil fuel is to be minimized for environmental sustenance.

1790","4. Conclusion and Future directions 
Researchers have been studying using Liquified Petroleum Gas, Biofuels, Hydrogen, CNG, and LNG as fuel for the 
transportation of both light-duty and heavy-duty transport through trucks, buses, and other vehicles. 
 
• 
LPG offers very few advantages when compared to conventional fuels. More research is required to assess 
the decarbonization of LPG and Bio-LPG fuels in the transportation sector. Whether LPG can be used as a 
primary fuel or alternate fuel is unknown. Very little research has been done about the use of LPG and Bio-
LPG. 
• 
Biofuels are environmentally friendly, but they are not economical compared to conventional fuels. Much 
research is required in this direction. 
• 
LNG is economical and offers some reduction in greenhouse gas- common pollutants and particle 
emissions. The methane leakage issue needs to be addressed. But more research is required in this direction 
• 
LNG as fuel is already tested in a few countries such as America, Canada, India, and China for LD and HD 
transportation. 
• 
The demand for LNG in India, like in other parts of the world, is growing, and researchers have much 
scope for studying operational, economic, safety, and environmental aspects. 
• 
India is emerging as a significant LNG market shortly. There is a massive demand for consumer-friendly 
regulatory authority for achieving long term goals, 
• 
The main limitation of this paper is that only fuels that can be used in IC Engines are presented in this 
work. Electric vehicles are not considered.

Abstract 
 
In this research work, the acoustic characteristics of noise produced by TG950 generator is studied and a suitable 
physical full scale model acoustic enclosure for it has been designed and evaluated and is hereby presented. The 
generator was treated as a point source and the insertion loss of the produced model of full enclosure was found to be 
quite good. The results show that the noise level was reduced by about 17 % at the optimum stack height of 1600 mm. 
The effect of exhaust tunneling was investigated. Results showed that exhaust tunnel projection beyond 200mm did 
not significantly improve the enclosure insertion loss. The enclosure model and the generator were discovered to have 
good thermal conditions under natural convection, with a maximum temperature rise of 9oC from ambient temperature 
of 30 oC, thereby eliminating the need for artificial cooling and its consequent ancillary power consumption.

1. Introduction  
Due to the shortfall in power supply in some developing countries like Nigeria, individuals have resorted to portable 
electricity generators for powering their home lighting units, televisions, laptop and desktop computers, and charging 
mobile phone batteries. These mini generators also find popular use in small offices, shops, and market stalls for the 
same or similar purposes. While these generators, no doubt, play key role in the life of the people in the developing 
countries, they, however, cause enormous noise pollution of the environment and therefore constitute hazard to both 
the user and the occupants of the immediate neighborhood. These petrol engine powered generators have also been 
indicated to have caused the death of many people due to the inhalation of carbon monoxide emissions from them as 
they are usually located close to the user’s environment. 
 
The response of the human ear to sound or noise depends both on the sound frequency and the sound pressure level. 
In psycho-acoustics, both the physical characteristics of noise and the way the human ear responds to it are considered.

enclosure, while it increases the temperature inside the enclosure as shown in Figure 12. 
 
5. Conclusion 
It has been observed that the mini generator set can be approximated to a point source with no directivity at a minimum 
listener position of 1 m from the source. The generator noise decays with increasing distance away from the generator 
and at a rate which is in agreement with the theoretical prediction. The insertion loss of the full acoustic enclosure is 
substantial and hence can provide succor to the menace of noise pollution from these categories of generators. Worthy 
of mention is the fact that the generator can be operated at safe temperatures inside the enclosure. Hence, the enclosure 
which would provide protection as well as noise reduction can therefore be put outside the immediate user’s 
environment, under rain or sunshine, without fear of damage or loss. This will therefore save the population from the 
harmful effects of the generator fumes which has been pointed to have caused the death of many users.

Abstract 
 
Scele is a distance learning media used online by students of Poltekkes Kemenkes Riau during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
All lecture activities such as teaching and learning, quizzes, assignments, and other lecture activities are carried out 
through SCELE. In its operation, there were a number of problems felt by students that attracted the interest of 
researcher to conduct research on student satisfaction with SCELE. This research was conducted at Poltekkes 
Kemenkes Riau with the aim of identifying user satisfaction with the system. This study uses quantitative methods 
and uses the EUCS model. The population in this study amounted to 887 students. After calculating using the Slovin 
technique with a margin of error of 10%, the sample is 90 people and the sampling technique is accidental sampling. 
Process data analysis using PLS-SEM with SmartPLS 3.0. The results obtained are ease of use (EOU) and content 
(CON) affect user satisfaction while accuracy, format, and timeliness have no effect on user satisfaction.

1. Introduction  
The application of information technology is believed to be able to improve the quality of education and can help the 
student learning process (Sopiandi 2017; Hamzah, et al., 2021; Hamzah, et al., 2019). An example of the role of 
information and communication technology in the field of education is the application of e-learning methods that allow 
lecturers and students can carry out lesson online or remotely (Kamal et al. 2020; Hamzah, et al., 2021). E-learning is

make it easier for students in their lectures matters such as teaching and learning activities. 
 
3.12 The Effect of Timeliness on User Satisfaction 
The result obtained after the calculation show that the hypothesis is rejected and the timeliness variable doesn’t have a 
positive and significant effect on user satisfaction. It is proven by the value of t-statistic is 1.025 and the value of p 
values is 0.153. The value of t-statistic is lower than the t-table value which is 1.66 and because of that the hypothesis 
is rejected. 
 
4. Conclusion  
Based on the research of User Satisfaction Analysis of Scele in Poltekkes Kemenkes Riau, the result obtained there are 
two variables that affect user satisfaction on the e-learning of Poltekkes Kemenkes Riau. The variables are content and 
ease of use. In this study, the content variable and the ease of use variable have a positive and significant influence on 
user satisfaction, this means that if the e-learning content is complete, useful, and in accordance with the user needs it 
will increase the satisfaction. Similar to content variable, if the system is easy to use for students in Poltekkes Kemenkes 
Riau, it will increase the satisfaction. The developers of the e-learning must pay attention to these two variables for the 
success of e-learning in the future. Content, accuracy, format, ease of use, and timeliness variables in this research 
represent strongly (83.8%) variance of the user satisfaction based on the coefficient of determination calculation.

Abstract 
 
Spur gears are employed for transferring both motion and power from driver shaft to driven shaft. The performance 
of Spur gears largely depends upon its design and construction. Thus there is a need for inspecting spur gear before 
deployment. During the inspection, a spur gear will be checked for pitch circle, diametral pitch, center distance, outside 
diameter, etc. Many techniques have been proposed by researchers for the measurement of gear elements. Many of 
these techniques are contact-based and are fit for sampling inspection. These techniques are not amenable to 
automation. Sampling inspection techniques are not fool-proof. With the advent of 3D printing and Industry 4.0, there 
is a thrust is toward 100% inspection. This has necessitated the need for designing and developing new inspection 
techniques for measuring spur gear elements in real-time. In the present research, an attempt has been made to design 
and develop a new non-contact and online, technique for inspecting spur gears in real-time. The measurements made 
by using the proposed method are validated by standard methods and are in good agreement.

1. Introduction  
In mechanical systems such as automobiles, machine tools, etc., different types of gears are used for transferring both 
motion and power. Spur gears are employed for transferring both motion and power from driver shaft to driven shaft. 
Gears of different sizes are being used in machine tools, Aerospace, Gear pumps, Automobiles, etc. The performance 
of spur gears largely depends upon their design and construction. Gears are being made by 3D printing. 3D printing 
mainly consists of construction of 3D model of the gear, slicing and final printing of gear (Zihong Wang, 2021). There 
is a need for inspecting spur gear before deployment. During the inspection, a spur gear will be checked for pitch 
circle, diametral pitch, center distance, module, circular pitch, etc. (ANSI/AGMA 2015). They are defined as follows.

Different types of testing are carried out in industries, before releasing the gear for deployment. So that, the gear 
functions as per the expectations set by the designer. Accuracy of the spur gear elements determines the functional 
performance and service life. 
   
2. Literature review 
Traditionally, gear measurements can be broadly classified into analytical and functional. In the analytical method, 
gear elements are checked for compliance with the design specification (Ni et al., 2021). These techniques are mostly 
manual and make use of several instruments and they are time-consuming. Functional testing involves rolling the gear 
to be inspected in tight mesh with that of the master gear. If certain gear parameters of test gear are not as per design 
specifications, when the two gears are rolled, there will be variation in the center distance (Goch et al., 2003). This 
variation in the center distance is a composite effect of variation in tooth profile, pitch, tooth thickness, and runout 
error. The advantage of functional gear testing is that it is very quick (Goch et al. 2006, Martin et al., 2021). The

The accuracy of the proposed method is 94%. The method was tested for repeatability and has shown a repeatability 
error of ± 5.14%. This is a considerable improvement when compared to the existing methods of Gear inspection 
techniques. Many existing techniques are time consuming and fit for post process inspection of Gears. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The present research work demonstrates a novel technique for the inspection of Spur gears. The method makes use of 
a Vision system for acquiring images of the Gears. These images are then processed for image quality enhancement. 
Then the images are used for computing the following Gear parameters. 
a. 
Gear tooth thickness 
b. Gear pitch 
c. 
Gear profile 
The method also does gear profile as well as texture analysis through GLCM.  The method is also capable of 
classifying gears into Good/Bad/Rework categories. 
Thus, the proposed method is a non-contact means of comprehensively inspecting a Spur gear, in a single set-up. The 
method finds application in the online inspection of Gears. The classification accuracy was 94%. The method was 
tested for repeatability and has shown a repeatability error of ± 5.14%.

Abstract  
 
Wind energy has been recognized as one of the fastest-growing energy sources in world and as a key role in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, reducing dependence on oil, diversifying energy supply, and providing electricity at a low 
cost. In its 2030 Vision, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has recently set ambitious targets to move away from oil 
dependency and redirect the efforts towards more higher-value exploitation of oil and gas, mainly meeting 10 percent 
of its energy demand through renewable energy sources. This paper attempts to explore the feasibility of using wind 
turbine machines for energy generation in Saudi Arabia by presenting a study of the opportunities and challenges that 
can arise while installing these machines. The paper also highlights several technical challenges and gaps that have 
been anticipated for this design motivation. Observations and upcoming trends show that by 2030 renewable energy, 
including solar and wind, will provide up to 50% of electricity production in the Kingdom.

1. Introduction  
The negative impact of consuming fossil fuels such as natural gas and oil has been a growing concern for policymakers 
worldwide due to the adverse effect on human and environmental health (Anon 2006). The necessity for transforming 
the complete power generation process to meet people's needs has been a critical concern for almost every country. 
The use of renewable energy sources is perceived to be the most feasible solution. The United States, China, and 
several other European countries are already adopting renewable energy generation methods, and wind energy is the 
major contributor here (Caldera, Bogdanov, and Afanasyeva 2018). Several other countries, including Saudi Arabia, 
have been trying to shift to using wind energy as the primary energy source because of its abundance. However, 
diverse challenges impair the progress rate massively. 
 
Due to Saudi Arabia's vital role in the Middle Eastern region, it is poised to be a major contributor to wind energy use 
as the primary source of power generation. The recently announced ""Vision 2030"" transformation plan (Anon 2006) 
by Saudi Arabia can prove decisive in promoting the importance and relevance of wind energy as the government 
looks toward exploring renewable sources of energy for sustained growth. The Vision 2030 program includes 
increasing the power generation capabilities of KSA to 16GW using wind energy, therefore confirming the countries' 
pledge to reduce the global carbon footprints (Anon 2006). However, the move will require Saudi Arabia to undertake 
massive reforms in understanding the feasibility of using the appropriate technology and scientific means to achieve

suppliers, and other related parties to increase their capabilities for designing the equipment and resources required 
for tapping into the natural resource effectively (Boretti et al. 2020).

The weather forecast Saudi Arabia from KAPSARC showed the latitude, Longitude, wind direction angle, and wind 
speed-rate data between 2018 and 2019 and its great potential of wind energy in the Kingdom. According to wind 
speed and Air temperature analysis at peak-time, wind energy challenges showed the potential and challenges of using 
wind energy in Saudi Arabia during the time since wind speed has different reading during the year. The outcomes

peak period, the following cities showed the highest records Yenbo, Taif, Qaisumah, and Haql. Haql and Yanbu cities 
showed great potential for generating wind power during the year. The main challenges of installing wind turbines   
summarized as following: 
●     The estimated cost of installing wind turbines with the variety of power and energy ratings. 
●     The changeable wind speed during the year. 
However, Saudi Arabia is minimizing the gap between wind energy targets and the installed systems. As a future goal, 
we guarantee that Yenbo, Taif, Qaisumah, and Haql have the highest potential in generating wind energy. Furthermore, 
we predict installing a wind turbine in these cities will improve the dependency on renewable energy.

Abstract 
 
Merdeka Belajar Kampus Merdeka (MBKM) is a policy of the Minister of Education and Culture which 
aims to encourage students to master various sciences to enter the world of work. The Independent Learning 
Policy-Independent Campus is in accordance Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 3 of 2020 concerning 
National Higher Education Standards. The policy provides opportunities for students to learn autonomously 
or independently and be responsible for themselves. Students have the right to take part in learning outside 
the study program on campus and outside campus in various activities such as student exchanges, 
internships/work practices, teaching assistance in education units, research, humanitarian projects, 
entrepreneurial activities, independent studies/projects, and building villages/Real Work Courses. 
Thematic. From the questionnaire data, it shows that the interest of Universitas Narotama students to be 
involved in activities outside the study program has increased sharply, this shows that the MBKM policy is 
able to help students get experience learning as a provision to face life and life in the future. To realize this 
learning experience, universities must build cooperation with the business/industry world and the 
government. Cooperation is based on the framework of improving the professionalism of the academic 
community.
