Abstract 
Integrated Business Planning (IBP) has evolved from the Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) process as a 
methodology for assessing and optimising financial performance of operational plans. However, despite the 
engagement of finance in the planning processes, many IBP implementations have suffered the same engagement and 
sponsorships challenges as S&OP. This paper examines implementation from the perspective of using a “change 
vehicle” – technology – as a tool to both lower the barriers to change and provide participants with the momentum to 
move thought the change steps of: creating a sense of urgency, providing a guiding coalition, enlisting volunteers, 
enabling action and generating short-term wins around a strategic vision and instituting change. We examine the SAP 
cloud product IBP through the lens of change management and its potential to overcome the barriers observed in 
traditional IBP and S&OP implementations. A key finding from the analysis in this work is that the standard 
spreadsheet user interface provided by the solution in effect removes the need to transition users from the comfort 
zone of using spreadsheets to a new solution space. The implications of this work are that S&OP and IBP may be 
implemented using the SAP IBP cloud solution at reduced management time cost to an organisation, facilitating 
improved operational outcomes using more junior leveraging operational teams than was previously possible under 
traditional business process re-engineering.

Abstract 
 
The past literature has seen considerable growth in lean and green concepts in the context of developed countries. 
However, despite the increasing interdependencies between developing and developed economies, little is known in 
the context of developing economies. This study investigates the impact of green and lean practices, and reverse 
logistics on organizational performance in the context of a developing economy. We employ a quantitative research 
design, where a sample of 170 responses was generated from senior managers of manufacturing firms in Pakistan – a 
developing economy. The analysis uncovers those green practices have a significant positive nexus with 
organizational performance in a developing economy like Pakistan. Further, we find that lean practices and reverse 
logistics serially mediate the relationship between green practices and organizational performance. We thus suggest 
green practices, lean practices, and reverse logistics as key levers to enhance performance and gain a competitive 
advantage for the firms in the developing economy like Pakistan. This is among the few studies testing serial mediation 
of lean practices and reverse logistics between green practices and organizational performance. The findings offer 
numerous contributions to both theory and practice.

1. Introduction  
Due to the developments in past decades, the world has become globally more connected. Transportation of materials 
and goods from developing countries to developed countries is more rapid than it was in the past. Growing awareness 
and concerns which are spreading all around the globe regarding the environment are urging the manufacturing firms 
of developing countries to transform the traditional manufacturing processes and adopt new environmentally friendly 
manufacturing processes. As such, environmentally friendly green practices, lean practices, and reverse logistics have 
become the topmost priority for manufacturing firms, small or large. Azevedo, Carvalho, and Machado (2011) 
suggested several green practices, including atmosphere-friendly packaging, reverse logistics, waste minimization, 
lowering the consumption and usage of toxic and hazardous materials, environmentally friendly product designing, 
ISO certifications, collaboration with customers regarding environmentalism. Digalwar, Tagalpallewar, and 
Sunnapwar (2013) further added that green practices should be sheltered all over the product manufacturing cycle. 
That is, starting from the selection of the manufacturing process to its usage and then the end-of-life scenario needs to 
be environmentally friendly. And then recycling or reuse of the product should be made possible. Ninlawan, Seksan,

(Resta, Dotti, Gaiardelli, and Boffelli, 2016) and (Bashir, Suresh, Proverbs, and Gameson, 2011) which say that the 
adoption of lean practices will bring a lot of advantages for the firms and will be helpful for them in enhancing their 
performance. 
 
Hypothesis 5 depicts the impacts of reverse logistics on organizational performance. Results have shown that the 
implementation of reverse logistics will enhance organizational performance. These findings are in line with past 
research carried out by (Beleya, Bakar, and Chelliah, 2017) and (Chinda, 2017) which say that the adoption of reverse 
logistics will help firms in improving their performance and will bring competitive advantages for them.  
 
Hypothesis 6 was to investigate the serial mediation of lean practices and reverse logistics between green practices 
and organizational performance. To prove this serial mediation, we have used a process macro for SPSS that has been 
shaped by  (Hayes and Scharkow, 2013). The findings are in line with past research carried out by (Panwar et al., 
2018) and (Simpson and Power, 2005). The results have shown that green practices have a positive impact on 
organizational performance and the serial mediation of lean practices and reverse logistics has also been proven 
between green practices and organizational performance. 
 
Past studies have indicated that green practices, lean practices, and reverse logistics are very useful practices, and their 
implementation can help firms in improving their performances. But when it comes to finding supportive links 
between these practices, there was still a gap, especially in the context of a developing economy like Pakistan. We 
find that the implementation of green practices has positive impacts on organizational performance. Our study also 
investigates the serial mediation of lean practices and reverse logistics between green practices and organizational 
performance. Results of our present study depict that green practices, lean practices, and reverse logistics have positive 
impacts on organizational performance, and lean practices and reverse logistics serially mediate between green 
practices and organizational performance.  
 
5.3 Directions for Future Researchers 
As the present research does not explore the linkages, which lie between the performance benchmarks and facilitators 
of these practices, for this, future researchers might use ANP to investigate those linkages. Furthermore, future 
researchers might take society’s awareness as a moderating variable and investigate the impacts of green practices, 
lean practices, and reverse logistics on the performance of industries.

Abstract 
The widespread impacts of Covid19 to the market and the minds of the practitioners can be deduced. The current 
study provides a timely investigation of the impacts of the global pandemic on the office property market so that the 
proper recommendations on construction management can be given to policymakers and market practitioners. 
Essentially, as the property price has a lagged effect after a significant event, the expectation of the practitioners in 
the property industry would be consulted. The current study provides a timely investigation of the impacts of the 
global pandemic on the office property market so that the proper recommendations on construction management can 
be given to policymakers and market practitioners. The composition of the office property price, the price model of 
housing property was adopted in the current study. Along with the customisation of the factors with respect to the 
pricing application of the office property, the theoretical model for the office property price was developed.

1. Introduction
The current study provides a timely investigation of the impacts of the global pandemic on the office property market 
so that the proper recommendations on construction management can be given to policymakers and market 
practitioners. Essentially, as the property price has a lagged effect after a significant event, the expectation of the 
practitioners in the property industry would be consulted.  
1.1 Aim and Objectives 
Regarding the motivation of the current work in assessing the expectation of the stakeholders for the office property 
price under the pandemic, the aim of the current work was defined as to priorities the major influencers of the property 
price resulting from the Covid19 event in the mind of the practitioners so that proper advice can be generated to the 
policymakers and the market practitioners. Hence, with the intention of accomplishing the aim, the five objectives 
were defined so as to guide the implementation of the research study. 
1.
To review the unique characteristics of the office property market and the primary impacts of the Covid19
on the property price.
2.
To identify the factors that affect the property price in general and the influence of the related factors under
the pandemic event.
3.
To correlate the influencers and the expectation of the office property price in order to reveal the relative
strength of the influencers.
4.
To conduct a segmented analysis of the practitioners with respect to their demographic information.
5.
To propose recommendations for the policymakers and the market practitioners based on the analytic
findings.

1. To 
review 
the 
unique 
characteristics of the office 
property market and the 
primary 
impacts 
of 
the 
Covid19 on the property 
price. 
The review of the unique characteristics of the office property 
market can be observed in the first section Literature Review 
with the title The Unique Characteristics of the Local Office 
Property Market, while the characteristics of the office property 
market were summarised. On the other hand, the review of the 
primary impacts of Covid19 on property price can be observed 
in the second section of the Literature Review with the title of 
The Impacts of Covid19, while the impacts of the pandemic on 
property price was consolidated. 
2. To identify the factors that 
affect the property price in 
general and the influence of 
the related factors under the 
pandemic event. 
The identification of the factors that affect the property price in 
general and the influence of the related factors under the 
pandemic event can be observed from the final section of the 
Literature Review with the title of The Factors Associated to the 
Property Price, while the customised and localised factors for the 
office property price referencing from the price model of the 
property price can be seen in the section. 
3. To correlate the influencers 
and the expectation of the 
office property price in order 
to reveal the relative strength 
of the influencers. 
Along with the research design mentioned in Methodological 
Approach, the result for the correlation between the influencers 
and the expectation of the office property price can be observed 
in the third section of Findings & Discussion with the title of 
Correlation Analysis, while the relative strength of the 
influencers can be seen in the associated contents. Additionally, 
the formulation for the linear model to characterise the 
influencers and the outcome can be seen in the fourth section of 
Findings & Discussion with the title of Regression Analysis. 
4. To conduct a segmented 
analysis of the practitioners 
with 
respect 
to 
their 
demographic information. 
In the same sense, the segmented analysis of the practitioners for 
their demographic information can be seen in the final section of 
Findings & Discussion with the title Segmented Analysis. At the 
same time, the respondents diversity of opinion was depicted. 
5. To propose recommendations 
for the policymakers and the 
market practitioners based on 
the analytic findings. 
Finally, along with the summary of the analytic findings of the 
first section of the final chapter with the title of Summary of the 
Result, three recommendations to the policymakers and the 
market practitioners under the pandemic were proposed. In 
contrast, the related contents can be seen in the second section 
of Conclusion & Recommendation with the title of 29. 
Recommendations. 
 
Therefore, with respect to the evaluation of the accomplishment of the objectives, it can be seen that all five of them 
were responded, while the aim of “prioritising the major influencers of the property price resulting from the Covid19 
event in the mind of the practitioners so that proper advice can be generated to the policymakers and the market 
practitioners” was accomplished, so it was justifiable to claim the completion of the research project.

Abstract 
In most cases, many technology products resulting from research happened to fail to be launched to the market due to 
the valley of death. This obstacle usually occurs in the transition process between technology development and 
technology commercialization. Hence, critical action is needed to accelerate the technology commercialization to 
ensure the commercialization potency of research output does not fall into the valley of death. The innovation of the 
Electric Motorcycle Swap Battery (EMSB) technology encourages the formation of a new ecosystem at the early of 
the supply chain, including technopreneurs and startups from manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors for 
commercialization. Swappable Batteries (SB), Electric Motorcycle (EM), and Battery Swap/Charging Station (BSCS) 
are key components of EMSB that have attracted the attention of supply chain players and government to find a 
thriving solution to enable faster adoption and diffusion of EMSB in Indonesia. Previously, the Center of Excellence 
for Electrical Energy Storage Technology, Universitas Sebelas Maret (or CoE-EEST UNS) has developed SB, EM, 
and BSCS prototypes with limited systems to operate the EMSB. However, to transfer technological innovations 
and/or facilitate operations of the EMSB on a large scale, there are various challenges and problems with products, 
processes, innovations, and businesses that are required to be solved.  There are five interventions/models that were 
proposed by  CoE-EEST UNS, namely circular business for EMSB, innovation diffusion and adoption, technology 
readiness and economic benefits prediction, location-allocation for smart charging,  and Internet of Things based 
decision support system for distributing EMSB, and the technical requirements for interoperable of EMSB. The 
interventions/models are seen as alternatives to accelerate the downstream of EMSB technology innovation, and then 
maximize the economic benefits of a green economy in Indonesia.

Abstract 
In recent years, the telecommunications sector has become an important sector in the world, with globalization and 
the increase of technologies, people increasingly seek to be connected to the Internet and to obtain network services 
that meet their requirements. It is for this reason that companies are focusing their objectives to achieve a higher level 
of user satisfaction by implementing various tools. One of the methodologies that has helped certain companies to 
increase their level of user satisfaction by focusing their processes on the elimination of muda and other activities that 
do not generate value. That is why this research focuses on implementing the Lean methodology focused on services 
and combining it with Agility, in order to insert a culture of employee participation and commitment from the 
beginning of the project. When reviewing different articles, it was found that there are few articles that combine these 
two methods in telephone operators or that even use any of them. According to the results obtained by the case studies, 
it is expected a reduction in call waiting time, reduction in the resolution time of customer requests, increase in the 
performance index of the customer service process and reduction of rework that does not add value to the processes.

1. Introduction
Currently, the telecommunications sector has become one of the most important sectors globally, as the number of 
people in all parts of the world who need to be connected to the Internet has increased.  This growth is due to the 
increased demand for internet and mobile telephony services in the context of COVID-19. However, despite the 
increase in the number of users demanding these services, there is much dissatisfaction on the part of customers with 
the service they receive. Such is the case of the 2020 quality of service ranking prepared by OSIPTEL, the Supervisory 
Body of Private Investment in Telecommunications in Peru, reveals that none of the Peruvian operators managed to 
exceed the minimum expected target level of 75% of the service received. This shows the need for operators to focus 
their efforts on improving the quality of service they offer (Muente, 2020, OSIPTEL). 
The problem identified according to the literature leads us to one case study of a telecommunications company in the 
city of Barranquilla, Colombia. It explains that the main problem is the dissatisfaction of customers as a result of the 
delays in response time to deal with the procedures carried out and the delay in answering calls, taking between 9 and 
16 minutes to get any communication with a person in the customer service area (Camargo and Troncoso 2020).  
On the other hand, in another research done for a national telecommunications corporation in Guayaquil, Ecuador, it 
was observed that the main problem was the desertion of customers in their fixed telephony, mobile and internet 
services, due to delays in solving problems, complaints in the service and inefficiency in the processing of claims 
(Granda.and Jácome 2019). All the above mentioned shows that the telecommunications sector presents problems in

Abstract 
Internet of Things (IoT) and big-data analytics imply the development of supply chain analytics (SCA). Despite 
industries recognizing SCA's potential benefits, its utilization is not massive yet. The study aims to develop reports 
based on the descriptive-analytic task of SCA for the electric motorcycle business with a swappable battery system. 
There are two goals: 1) exploration of the business process and the data generated by IoT from the electric motorcycle 
industry, and 2) generating descriptive analytics for minimum attribute data from the company to get insights about 
swap transactions at their battery swap station locations. We used general questions that usually will be answered by 
the descriptive-analytic task for generating some visualizations of the data. As a result, the company knows that about 
60% of the battery swap stations have transactions below the average, peak time at 7-10 am and 1-6 pm, and most of 
the transactions are conducted on Thursday and Friday. The other result is that there are five questions or decisions 
that the company should deeply review.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of the Study
The Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia targets the sales of electric motorcycles in 2025 to be 1.76 units
and increase to 2.45 million in 2030 (Andryanto 2022). The target is to support the world trend toward using electric
vehicles, which are energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. This target is expected to be achieved because
electric motorcycle consumers are facilitated by battery swapping stations (BSS) to get a fully charged battery and
48",,"Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022

2022 ranges huge, between 1 and 244 swapping, and 60% of them are below average. Based on descriptive analysis 
of secondary data for one BSS location with observations for 1 x 24 hours x 30 days, the peak time of battery turnover 
occurred at 7 to 10 a.m., and 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., and on Thursday and Friday.  
 
To sum up, there is five decision that needs to be studied more deeply by the company. The five things are (1) What 
is the ideal target of the per-day transaction that the company expects to be associated with the charged battery change 
rate? (2) How to make a more profound observation of the factors that affect the number of battery swapping besides 
delivery tasks by the couriers? (3) How to increase the number of swaps in BSS? Is it necessary to relocate them? (4) 
What is the allocation of the optimum number of compartments at each location that provides ideal occupancy? (5) Is 
it necessary to redistribute a fully charged battery at peak time if it is ever observed in the IoT data, when all batteries 
are charging and the customer has to wait? 
 
This research on battery swapping transaction data on BSS, with a minimal number of attributes and a small amount 
of data, has provided insight for the electric motorcycle manufacturer or the operator of BSS. This indicates the need 
for further research to create a more comprehensive SCA model that can present analytical results in descriptive, 
predictive, and prescriptive forms to support the supply chain operations of the electric motorcycle business based on 
battery swapping systems.

Abstract 
The purpose of this work is to provide information on cost improvements in SMEs in the brewing sector using lean 
manufacturing and BPM. A simulation model was created using Arena and Bizagi, where the model was made with 
the provision of a small brewing company, the indicators used to measure the effectiveness of the model are: 
distribution cost per bottle, percentage of use of containers, lead time and OTIF, these indicators seek to provide us 
with the necessary data to validate the process. This document shows us a more complete vision of the use of these 
tools and the result of their use. It will contribute to academic and professional work on lean manufacturing and BPM 
in small companies.

1.Introducción
The beer sector is of great importance for the economy of a country, such is the case of Spain, where it contributes 
1.3% of the GDP, generating a total of 3,600 million euros and more than 344,000 jobs (Álvarez, 2019), within this 
sector are craft beers that have also had a large increase in sales, as is the case in the US market, where craft brewers 
represent 24% of beer sales. On the contrary, the more industrial beers, with mass production and therefore more 
standardized, are losing ground (López, 2019). In Peru, the sector of craft beer production companies is constantly 
growing, managing to produce an estimated 2.5 million liters in 2021, exceeding the 2 million liters produced in 2019 
(López, 2022). This is due to the great boom that the sector has had because it is expanding, in addition, the investment 
that it entails as machines and raw material for its production is not high compared to other products, factors that 
influence the decision for production. 
According to the reviewed literature, the problem to be evaluated was identified as the high distribution costs in craft 
beer production companies. This occurs for reasons such as delivery delays, poor inventory management, low level 
of attention, among others. These can be found in other investigations such as the case of the company BODEMAX, 
from Ecuador, where it was established that the main limitation in the growth of the company was the management 
of its inventory of beer containers, keeping in useful stock only the 68% of the total stock (Aguilar et al., 2020). 
Similarly, inventory management is an issue that has little relevance and is not addressed within SMEs, generating a 
waste of resources and capital which is important for companies of this caliber (Ojeda, 2012). Likewise, in a study 
carried out in Ecuador, a survey was carried out among employees of a brewing company about whether there are 
delays in the time of attention to logistics deliveries, obtaining as a result that 74% of employees consider that there 
are, and 40% of the population considers that these incur in extra expenses. (Orange, 2016). 
To solve the problems of the craft brewing sector, a case study was considered that shows the main problems of the 
sector in search of cost reduction. The main problems found are poor inventory management, low level of attention,

6. Conclusions
Through the implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools, the average service time in Oxapampa was reduced, with 
an improvement of 27%, streamlining the process. In addition, the standardization of the work used helped us reduce 
service times, greatly reducing errors that could affect the quality of our products and services.

The application of lean manufacturing increased the efficiency of the workforce by 99%, which translates into a better 
use of time by our staff. We can conclude that the use of Lean manufacturing tools reduced the average order 
preparation time in both Lima and Oxapampa by 157% and 156%, respectively. 
 
The use of lean manufacturing, process standardization and BPM help companies in the brewing sector improve 
average service time, increase workforce efficiency, and reduce order preparation time for shipping customers. 
translating into a reduction in the variable costs of distribution, having as distribution cost per case of beer $2.56, 
being $1.28 fixed and $1.28 variable, after the application of these methodologies, the variable costs were reduced 
by 50-57% having as mean decrease in $0.64. Achieving that the final distribution cost is not $2.56 but $1.79 - $1.92, 
reducing the final distribution cost by 30-25%.

Abstract 
Interoperability plays an important role in the digital supply chain, especially in strengthening the integration and 
agility of the supply chain and thus improving customer service and sustainable organizational performance. This 
article aims to conduct an initial literature review on developing a model for determining interoperability requirements 
to ensure product collaboration between companies which is a smart connected product (SCP). There are three research 
questions formulated in this study, i.e., :  (1). how to develop interoperability requirements on SCP (case study on 
Electric Motorcycle Swappable Battery/EMSB); (2). how to control quality to ensure product collaboration according 
to requirements, and (3). how to develop an economic impact assessment model to implement companies’ 
interoperability requirements. Using limited literature review and adopting Denyer and Tranfield’s five steps in the 
literature review, this study explores academic literature to answer research questions that should be further studied. 
From the study results, it was found that the development of interoperability requirements had to be carried out in 
three domains, i.e., physical components, smart components, and connectivity components, using the Framework for 
Analysis Comparison and Testing Standard (FACTS). Quality Control (QC) tools have played a role in the standard 
testing phase so that interoperability requirements could be tested and proven applicability. In developing the 
economic impact assessment model, the ISO Methodology - Economic Benefit of Standards (EBS) framework could 
be used to solve problems.

Abstract 
The transportation sector is the main source of air pollution in Indonesian cities. Pollution can reduce air quality and 
increase carbon emissions that impact climate change. The Indonesian Government has issued regulations to accelerate 
the migration from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles to overcome this problem. This research 
is focused on electric motorcycles (EM) because motorcycles dominate more than 80% of the total vehicles in 
Indonesia. This paper aims to investigate consumer purchase intention in EM by considering consumer and product 
views in the Indonesian context. This research develops a conceptual framework by integrating the Unified Theory of 
Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the discrete choice model. This research contributes to considering 
brand trust factors into UTAUT and integrating consumer and product aspects in developing a hybrid choice model. 
This study will be conducted on motorcycle owners in Indonesia. The findings from the research will provide the EM 
purchase intention of Indonesian consumers by considering the analysis of consumer behavior for various EM 
attributes.

1. Introduction
The road transportation sector still contributes significantly to economic growth in many countries where this 
condition impacts energy security and air pollution (Li et al., 2018; Moradi and Vagnoni, 2018). Rapid economic 
growth will cause environmental quality to decline (Coates, 2016). The key concerns governments must solve in this 
century are those connected to air quality and human health, including climate change, air pollution, energy security, 
and energy shortages (Lopez-Arboleda et al., 2019). The primary contributor to air pollution in cities is the 
transportation sector. In urban areas, vehicle emissions account for 70% of the pollution caused by Nitrogen Oxide 
(NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Particulate (PM) pollution in urban areas (Ministry of 
Environment and Forestry, 2021). 
In the Indonesian context, vehicles have continued to increase in the last four years, reaching 143,797,227 units 
dominated by 121,209,304 motorcycles and 16,903,094 passenger cars in 2021 (Statistics Indonesia, n.d.-a). The most 
rapid growth was in motorcycles, with an average increase of 4.85 million units per year, where sales reached 
5,057,516 units in 2021 (AISI, n.d.). The number of motorcycles in Indonesia is more than other vehicles such as cars 
and buses. Motorcycles have several advantages, including low prices, low operational costs, and easy adjustments to 
road conditions (Dorocki  et al. 2021). These advantages encourage Indonesians to choose motorcycles as the main

Abstract 
Worldwide are working to support the transition of internal combustion engine vehicles to electric (battery-based) 
vehicles.  The electric vehicle program has faltered because the sales target for electric motorcycles until early 2022 
reached only 60%.  One reason is that investment in electric vehicles is still considered relatively high.  The results of 
previous studies regarding the battery ownership model significantly reduce investment in electric vehicles.  Swap 
batteries are expected to enter the end of life (EoL) phase after 5 - 10 years of use.  End of life swap batteries have the 
potential to impact the environment.  Studies related to the management and handling of EoL swap batteries are very 
open and relevant to be carried out.  In this article, the study begins with a review of related literature.  Then continues 
with a study of determining the technical criteria when it is appropriate for a swap battery to be declared EoL, and 
ends with a study of the EoL electric motorcycle swap battery (EMSB) management framework to be treated so that 
it can enter the second phase of life.  Criteria are determined by considering technical and environmental aspects.  The 
proposed treatment is reuse, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling.  This systematic review of the 
reverse logistics framework is expected to create a sustainable supply chain.

1. Introduction
Indonesia has also experienced dwindling fossil fuel reserves (Sitorus et al., 2014). Reduced reserves of fossil fuels 
impact the development of electric vehicle technology (electric vehicle = EV) to replace fossil fuel vehicles (internal 
combustion engine vehicle = ICEV). Indonesia was once the largest exporter of petroleum and played a very important 
role in the world organization OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries). Since 2004 the situation 
has changed; the petroleum demand level has increased, and Indonesia has bought more than it has sold (Tondang,

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a textile company (spinning yarn) that produces several semi-finished products in the form of cotton yarn, 
polyester, viscone rayon, and many more. This company has several problems in its business processes. The problem 
that arises is the unclear Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that the company has set which causes errors or 
disturbances in the production process. Another problem is the presence of a defective final product. For this reason, 
it can be seen the problems in the system that have been running so that improvements need to be made so that the 
problems that occur can be overcome by methods that can be used to control production quality, namely by using 
Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). The conclusion of this study is the 
calculation using the FMEA method and processing using the FTA method, obtained several suggestions for the root 
cause of each problem that exists. There factors that cause defects that cause Non-Conforming Product (NCP) are 
humans, method, material, machine and environment factors. The proposed improvement to reduce product defects is 
to apply the proposed improvement which has been processed using the FTA method.

1. Introduction
PT. XYZ is a textile company (spinning yarn) that produces several semi-finished products in the form of cotton yarn, 
polyester, viscone rayon, and many more. Since the inception of PT. XYZ until now, this company has made various 
kinds of production changes. Starting from the beginning which produces cloth until now, which only focuses on yarn 
production. PT. XYZ currently also produces not only one type of yarn, but also a variety of different yarns in each 
unit. Changes in the types of production are carried out by the company in order to remain competitive in the textile 
market in the national and international markets. Therefore, until now this company can still exist in the textile market 
and also continue to run its production smoothly. 
In its production activities, PT. XYZ uses sophisticated production machines with the help of competent human 
resources. In the production process, each work station uses modern and sophisticated machines. Starting from the 
raw material process to the packaging process, everything is fully machined in the process. By using machines in each 
production process, the production target becomes easier to achieve because the output produced has the same 
specifications. In addition, the use of modern machines can also save the company's expenses, because only a few 
workers are needed. In the production process flow, quality control is also carried out in each part of the production 
process, from raw materials to the packing process. Supervision and quality control in each process is carried out to 
maintain the quality of the final product produced. In addition, improving product quality will also greatly affect 
product sales, the better the product quality, the better sales will also be. Meanwhile, when product quality deteriorates,

5. Conclusion  
The conclusions obtained from data processing and analysis of practical work reports at PT. XYZ is based on the 
Pareto diagram the most common product defects during 2021 are corrugation rolls, ring roll coils, and cross rolls. 
There are 5 factors that cause defects that cause Non-Conforming Product (NCP), namely man, method, material, 
machine and environment factors. The proposed improvement to reduce product defects is to apply the proposed 
improvement which has been processed using the FTA method. 
 
Based on research that has been done at PT. XYZ and the conclusions made, there are several suggestions that can be 
considered by the company in its efforts to improve production quality control. Suggestions that can be given are that 
supervision is applied when implementing quality control of raw materials, production processes and when finished 
products should be further improved so that they can be controlled properly. The company should immediately take

Abstract 
Chemical industry is a company that processes the main raw material in the form of pine resin. This company faces 
the challenge of complexity in the organizational structure, which causes the company to find it increasingly 
challenging to plan and manage. If it is not addressed, it will impact the difficulty of communication between the 
company and supply chain partners, which also affects the effectiveness and efficiency of the supply chain in the 
company. Therefore, an evaluation of the company's supply chain performance is needed, which aims to identify 
indicators that can represent the company's supply chain flow process and determine the value of supply chain 
performance in the chemical industry. This study uses the Supply Chain Operation Reference Model (SCOR) method 
to discuss the supply chain performance measurement. Measurements are made based on 5 core processes, and 
performance metrics are presented as Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Then, each metric is weighted using AHP. 
According to the results of the study, it was found that the achievement of the company's performance was 82.42% 
which was included in the pretty good category.

1. Introduction
As an actor in the industrial sector, the companies are urged to be able to make improvements in all aspects. The rapid 
growth in the industrial sector is one of the reasons why. Improving in every aspect, also helps the company to offer 
their products and develop a wider market, one of which is the chemical industry. Therefore, companies can evade 
from falling behind in business competitiveness. The complexity of an organizational structure also makes it 
increasingly difficult for a company to plan and manage. If it is not addressed, it will impact the difficulty of 
communication between the company and supply chain partners. In addition, it also affects the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the company's supply chain. If there is ineffectiveness and inefficiency in the company's supply chain, it 
will increase costs, decrease customer satisfaction and decrease company profits. The greater the challenges the 
company faces, the more significant the impact on supply chain management (Yao et al. 2022).  
Many methods can measure the supply chain. One of the most well-known and general methods is Supply Chain 
Operation Reference (SCOR) Model. SCOR Model measurement was established by The Association for Operations 
Management (APICS), which measured business process and performance. Both process and performance have their 
metrics to be defined by, such as process is defined from plan, source, make, deliver, return, and enable activities and 
performance by company reliability, responsiveness, agility, cost, and asset management level. The SCOR model has

Overall, the company's performance can be said to be quite good, namely the achievement of 82.42%. Based on the 
results of the achievement of the company's performance that has been measured, it can be seen that the company's 
performance, especially in the upstream sector, which is related to suppliers and processing systems, has not yet 
reached its expectations. Meanwhile, the downstream performance, closely associated with the customer, can be said 
to be quite good. It is hoped that with the results of the implementation of this performance measurement system, the 
company can determine priorities for improvement in its business processes so that the achievement of company 
performance can increase and can also be used as strategic policy material for companies related to company 
performance in the following years. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the performance measurement system in the company, there are 8 KPIs that have been identified 
to represent the company's performance. 1 KPI represents the Plan process category, 1 KPI represents the Source 
process category, 2 KPI represents the Make process category, 2 KPI represents the Deliver process category, and 2 
KPI represents the Return process category. KPI identification is made by discussing and adjusting to the SCOR 
Model. The company’s overall performance can be said to be fairly good, namely the achievement of 82.42%. Overall, 
the company's performance, especially in the upstream sector related to suppliers and processing systems, has not yet 
met the company's expectations. Meanwhile, the downstream performance, closely related to the customer, can be 
said to be fairly good.

Abstract 
Musicians are often exposed to loud music during practice playing their instrument or performance on stage, so they 
are at risk of permanent cochlear nerve damage or hearing loss. However, the risk of hearing loss is not well understood 
since there is a significant inter-individual variation in susceptibility and degree of hearing loss. Hearing properly is 
vital for musicians for hear the right notes and words to playing in the correct pitch and key. Since it is not often 
possible to avoid the noise exposure, some changes of risk factors and use hearing protection devices are suggestion 
for preventing of hearing loss. Study aims were to determine the influence of sound exposure onset and duration to 
the hearing loss prevalence in musicians. This study was an observational analytic study using a cross sectional design 
conducted on 35 among musicians in Yogyakarta City Indonesia during October 2019 - February 2020. We collected 
demographic data, type of instruments, onset and duration exposure, complaints about hearing and the used of 
protective device. All participants underwent ear clinical examination and pure tone audiometry interpreted by an 
audiology consultant. The data obtained were described by frequency and percentage and compared ratio analysed 
using chi-square test. The prevalence of noise induced hearing loss in musicians at this study was 20%, an audiometric 
notch in one or both ears were found in 5.71 % and 14.29 % of the participants, respectively. The main complaint was 
tinnitus reported by 21 (60%) and only 2 (5.71%) of the participants wore hearing protection. Bivariate analysis using 
chi-square test between the sound exposure onset with hearing loss prevalence obtained p value of 0.578 (p > 0.05), 
and between the sound exposure duration weekly with hearing loss prevalence obtained p value of 0.02 (p < 0.05). 
The  sound exposure onset is not significantly influence to the hearing loss prevalence, while the weekly sound 
exposure duration is significantly influence to hearing loss prevalence in musicians. Since lack of knowledge and 
awareness most musicians never used protective devices.

6. Conclusion  
The sound exposure onset is not significantly influence to the hearing loss prevalence, while the hours of weekly 
sound exposure duration is significantly influence to hearing loss prevalence in musicians. Musicians exposed to high 
levels of sound but low levels of care for their hearing health, it’s caused a highlight the need for extensive hearing 
conservation programs for this group.

Abstract 
Quality of work life is one of the management system approaches to coordinate and connect the potential of human 
resources, where the quality of work life in the company is a management effort to meet the needs of employees 
simultaneously and continuously. Implementing the right work quality program through fair career development 
opportunities, conducting proper supervision and working relationships, providing compensation, benefits and 
rewards in accordance with the salary market and 3Ps as well as managing and guaranteeing working conditions and 
environment are very important, thus the company is expected to can retain the best employees, so that employee 
turnover is small, commitment, loyalty and optimal performance will be generated by employees.

1. Introduction
Organizations are managed and staffed by people. Without people, organizations can not exist. Indeed, the challenge, 
the opportunity, and also the frustration of creating and managing organizations frequently stem from the people-
related problems that arise within them. People-related problems, in turn, frequently stem from the mistaken belief 
that people are all alike, that they can be treated identically. Nothing could be further from the truth. Like snowflakes, 
no two people are exactly alike, and everyone differs physically and psychologically from everyone else. (Cascio, 
2022) Human capital management is about embracing an innovative approach and recognizes the value of employee 
inputs. Feedback must be encouraged to improve the workplace environment, communication, identification of shared 
interests and creation of shared values. It is essential to build a diverse workforce and zero tolerance to discrimination. 
Managers have the authority to accomplish goals through problem solving approaches. Communication flows up and 
down the organization. (Ganapathy, 2018) Human capital is not solely the people in organizations—it is what those 
people bring and contribute to organizational success. Human capital is the collective value of the capabilities, 
knowledge, skills, life experiences, and motivation of an organizational workforce. (Mathis & Jackson, 2010) 
In an organization, human resources, in this case, employees are an important factor for the organization, therefore it 
is necessary to have things that can encourage employees to work hard and show good performance. Two factors that 
need to be assessed are motivation and quality of work life. If employees have high motivation at work, it will 
encourage employees to complete the job well. Likewise, a good quality of work life in the company will stimulate

Figure 12. Working environment 
Based on the Figure 12, respondents' responses still need to be improved, this is evidenced by respondents who agree 
43% while neutral 38%. The results of interviews with several respondents obtained the opinion that the facilities and 
work comfort are quite good, but the location of the office is in an odd-even area in accordance with the DKI Regional 
Government regulations which makes employees uncomfortable so that they give a neutral opinion. Meanwhile, the 
HCM unit stated that the company always tries to provide ergonomic facilities so as to avoid the potential risk of 
injury or disease. The workspace is ergonomically designed so that it is expected to increase productivity and 
efficiency while reducing stress and fatigue. Employees who are in the work environment are provided with adequate 
facilities, the necessary work equipment, a comfortable work space, access to 24-hour security, conducting regular 
employee health checks, conducting periodic self-rescue programs. Also in order to maintain the health of employees, 
the company provides sports facilities on the 6th floor that employees can use according to their needs. This is also 
reinforced by the company's trade unions. 
4. Conclusion
1.
Whereas the aspect of career development opportunities must be one of the concerns for company management
so that every employee has the same opportunity in developing a career through training organized by the
company, but not a few employees have not been touched by career development patterns; the sub-aspects of
career development have not gone well and competency development is still a priority scale based on a high
competency gap and active employee involvement. So it can be concluded that the career development process
based on competence has not gone well, as well as the sub-aspects of promotion, rotation and mutation
opportunities. And there is a trend that some promotions are not transparent and not objective, so that if this
happens continuously, an unfavorable atmosphere will occur which will lead to low engagement and commitment.
2.
Aspects of supervision and working relations carried out by the leadership have been going well, the sub-aspects
of supervision and teamwork still need to be improved so that the company's performance will be better, but it is
hoped that the company's leaders will continue to improve it.
3.
Whereas the aspects of compensation, benefits and rewards in general, employees have received their rights
adequately. The sub-aspects of salary according to the market salary are concluded to be in accordance with the

Abstract 
Coaching has been introduced worldwide and absorbed into corporate HR as one of employee development programs 
quite intensively and extensively in recent years rebranded as Corporate Coaching (CC), with early indicators showing 
that coaching positively impacted employee performance. Unfortunately, further research on its impact on long-
term/sustainable employee performance has yet properly researched. Digital leadership (DL) on the other hand has 
becoming household jargon in the era of Industry 4.0 indicating the trend of leadership has shifted into the facilitation 
of a more data-driven, flexible time, people-oriented, collaborative, and technology-savvy working environment, with 
particular note that the research of DL still limited to short term performance. Work-life integration (WLI) construct 
as the mediating variable between DL and employee sustainable performance (E-SuPer) also has not been addressed 
sufficiently. The aim of this paper is to develop theoretical foundation for the nexus of CC, DL, E-SuPer, and WLI, 
thus providing a complete review of the literature on the interdependence association of the variables. This paper 
provides insights for researchers as well for managers on what variables need to be considered when it comes to 
similar interdependence.

Abstract 
This study intended to test the relationship between resilience and well-being among young adults in Jakarta during 
the Covid-19 Pandemic. In light of the amount and sort of adaptations and adjustments brought about by the Covid-
19 pandemic on various aspects of the life of the youth (for example, education, social context, employment prospects), 
coupled with the questionable social support they receive during the different phases of the pandemic (early on and 
most recently), enduring such chronic state of stress presented a much needed exploration into their psychological 
states and resources in order to map out the kind of support and ecosystem needed for the young generation to still be 
able to thrive in post-pandemic society 5.0.  The study made use of correlational statistics to test the relationship 
between levels of resilience and well-being among young adults in Jakarta during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The 
participants (gathered via convenience sampling) were 36 young adults in the age range 18-25 years located in Jakarta 
during the pandemic. Correlational results found significant negative and moderate relationship between resilience 
and well-being of young adults in Jakarta, r=-0.425, p<.01. It was found that the higher the resilience, the lower the 
well-being of young adults in Jakarta during the Covid-19 Pandemic.

1. Introduction
Two years on since the Covid-19 Pandemic, many concerns related to the psychological impact brought on by the 
adaptations to the new normal across various age groups and in numerous sectors of society were still very much 
discussed. How the pandemic caused changes in the economy, education, social relations as well as how it propelled 
the advancement of technology to be ever more present in daily lives became agendas for research in the social 
sciences (Yunus and Rezki, 2020; Napitupulu, 2020). Understandably, a group that warranted research interest in the 
context of the impact the pandemic had in the education sector could be found among young adults – who 
developmentally speaking may be dealing with life-changing issues in their own right. Several researches found 
indications of negative experiences with online learning among young adults aged 18-25 years (Napitupulu, 2020; 
Ferdiyanto, 2020; Rizal, 2020). In one study, it was found that as many as 95.8% of students experienced some forms 
of psychological distress/mental health issues (for example, anxiety, depression, loneliness) with regards to online 
learning; another study noted as many as 63.6% university students in a private university in Semarang had mental 
health problems, 50% had sleep disturbances, 50% experienced cognitive difficulties (for example, difficulty to 
concentrate), 50% felt tired all the time and 9% had thoughts of ending their life. With the uncertainty about the end 
to the pandemic, this added to the anxiety experienced by young adults whose developmental momentum was 
traditionally moved by the positive outlook, high hopes and bright prospects of the future. Having to live in such a 
prolonged state of uncertainty saw many to have dreams and aspirations compromised and many admitted to having 
serious suicidal ideations. The prolonged state of financial pressures and lack of social interactions that young adults 
had to go through put some under the impression that they were unable to achieve anything in life. 
In this light, it was due cause to attend to study and direct attention to the well-being of young adults during the 
pandemic with many studies describing negative experiences surrounding adjustments to online learning (Ferdiyanto, 
163","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022

in culture, economic opportunities, lifestyle, as well as psychosocial services available in various places. Several 
methodological recommendations could be made considering the results from current study, most notably bigger and 
more representative sampling.  
5. Conclusion
The current study set out to explore the relationship between resilience and well-being among young adults in Jakarta. 
Based on results from a total of 36 participants in Jakarta ranging from 18 to 25 years of age during the Covid-19 
Pandemic, it could be concluded that there was a significant negative and moderate relationship between resilience 
and well-being, r=-0.425, p<.01). It was found that the higher the resilience, the lower the well-being of young adults 
in Jakarta during the Covid-19 Pandemic. In light of the amount and sort of adaptations and adjustments brought about 
by the Covid-19 pandemic on various aspects of the life of the youth (for example, education, social context, 
employment prospects), coupled with the questionable social support they receive during the different phases of the 
pandemic (early on and most recently), the results of the current study was hoped to be informative to map out the 
kind of support and ecosystem needed for the young generation to still be able to thrive in post-pandemic society 5.0.

Abstract 
In the current research study, an investigation of the intervention of artificial intelligence in the designs of headphone 
cores was conducted so that the automated process can be accomplished with the trained network. With the empirical 
experience in the industry of earphone manufacturing, it can be seen that the design of the headphone was commonly 
referred to as the culmination of empirical experience, while a large portion of the products was developed based on 
the modification of diversified and attempts and prototypes. Therefore, the design and production rely on the 
experience of the senior developers consolidated from the practice, while the associated process is costly and involves 
extensive wastage. Due to the complexity and the nonlinear association between the selection of the parameters and 
the resulted sound quality, the intensive involvement of the senior staff and the unpredictable outcomes are commonly 
seen, while it also limited the rapid development of the products. Thus, the objective of the study is to adopt the 
machine learning technique to explore the connection between the parameters and the targeted outcome so that a 
guided and systematic design can result. Practically, the research work characterized the design with the selection of 
types of divers (dynamic driver/moving coil, balanced armature driver, and planar magnetic driver), magnet (N35, 
N40, N45, and N50 Grade Neodymium Magnet), voice coils (copper wire, copper-covered aluminium wire, and silver 
wire), 
and 
diaphragm 
(polyethene 
terephthalate, 
polyethene 
naphtholate, 
polyetheretherketone, 
and 
polyetheretherketone + polyurethane) along with the options of single and double drivers in order to simplify the 
design problem. Then, the outcome of sound quality was attributed to six parameters, including total harmonic 
distortion, output power, frequency response, signal-to-noise ratio, speaker impedance, and headroom with seven 
levels. As a result, the earphone design problem was simplified as 8 inputs and 6 outputs, while the research work was 
dedicated to finding the black box in connection with the inputs and outputs. The current study adopted the linear 
regression method, the principal component analysis, and the neural network for the exploration in order to conduct 
the performance evaluation. After the full investigation of the models, it was found that the neural network provided 
a promising performance in terms of root mean square error due to its nonlinear nature of it. On the other hand, the 
limitation of both linear regression and principal component analysis exhibited the limitation in the characterization 
of the linkage between the independent and dependent variables. Finally, the trained models can be utilized in the 
design of the earphones for the sake of alleviating human intervention and generating practical impacts on the earphone 
design process.

Abstract 
We present an ideal model of a typical vehicle assembly plant by generalizing selected case studies from the literature. 
The ideal model was extended to capture certain realities of material handling to obtain new scenarios. The Arena 
simulation platform was used to model both the base and scenario models.  Data and probability distribution were 
obtained from specifications from the literature and random projections. Using the number of outputs from the vehicle 
assembly plant, the base model and the scenarios were analyzed. Results of the sensitivity analysis of the scenario 
models confirm that as real-world systems emanate from the ideal systems for example by capturing material handling 
realities, the production or service outputs are constrained either positively or negatively. Thus, showing the need for 
understanding different configuration settings of material handling equipment when scaling up production outputs is 
desired. The simulation modelling and analysis employed are useful both as classroom illustrations on material 
handling, aid for engineering education and other users in need of general understanding and applications of discrete 
event simulation modelling.

1. Introduction
The automotive industry is one of the several manufacturing industries that contributes positively to the industrial and 
economic base of countries. The automotive industry also largely impacts diverse sectors of a country's economy due 
to its end products that facilitate the distribution and movement of goods and persons.  Developed countries such as 
Germany and Japan, are known to have several lines of vehicle assembly plants (Wirabhuana et al., 2008). On another 
hand, developing countries such as Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria have seen the need to scale up their low-capacity 
vehicle assembly plants due to the large volume of imported vehicles (Ikome et al., 2022, Gorham, 2022).  
The vehicle assembly process could come with several variations depending on the type of vehicle being manufactured 
such as trucks, cars, bus. However, the importance of a generic assembly procedure for different types of vehicles was 
discussed by  (Wang et al., 2011, Wy et al., 2011).  According to Wang et al. (2011), Oumer et al. (2016) the generic 
assembly starts from the arrival of different vehicle parts into the assembly facility.  The parts are then distributed into 
different sections of the assembly plants based on the manufacturing schedule.  Typical sections/areas of the assembly 
plant include the body shop, paint shop, assembly section, buffer area, quality inspection and motor pool section. 
Important in the vehicle assembly process irrespective of the manufacturing plan is the need to ensure that the process 
is efficient and effective, delivering the expected number of vehicles while ensuring resources are adequately utilized. 
Therefore, productivity improvement through the optimization of several decisions and resources such as indicated by 
Oyewole and Adetunji, (2020) and Oyewole, (2020) become critical.   The simulation modelling technique has been 
very useful as a productivity, analytical and improvement tool in a lot of manufacturing environments (Wy et al., 
171","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022

also show the likelihood of outputs becoming insensitive to resource increase. This will be most likely when the 
number of parts flowing through the system is much smaller than the transfer resource capacity. 
6. Conclusion
In this study, a simulation model of a generic vehicle assembly plant was presented to illustrate the transitions of real 
models from ideal models using material handling assumptions. The conveyor and resource-constrained capacity 
scenarios were modelled into an ideal vehicle assembly model. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that in the short run material handling devices have the likelihood of either increasing, 
decreasing, or keeping constant the outputs of a typical operation or process such as vehicle assembly. Therefore, 
showing the importance of different configuration settings and trading of variables to yield intended results for 
production outputs.  
Findings from this study are useful during material handling and design specification to observe the possible 
relationships among certain variables of the system being designed. In addition, the discrete event simulation and 
modelling logic employed in this study could be a useful aid in engineering education research to study the flow of 
students under possible semester and assessment constraints. 
This study could be improved with the use of more real-life data. In addition, several assumptions considered could 
be removed to see how this will impact the results. For example, some plants operate continuously, and steady-state 
modelling might be appropriate. Furthermore, resource schedules and failures could provide more practicality when 
considering resource utilization. More performance objectives such as the throughput, utilization of resources, cycle 
time, and average number in the queue for each process could also provide more insight into the material handling 
process. Lastly, complex robotic features, automated conveyors, automatic storage, and retrieval systems are realities 
to consider as the world moves in the fourth industrial revolution direction.

Abstract 
This article carries out a systematic literature review of the technologies and methods applied in aquaculture rearing 
processes. It is intended to demonstrate that there are many opportunities for improvement in this sector, given that 
many of the aquaculture practices are still carried out in a rudimentary way. A review of related articles of techniques 
applied in aquaculture in different databases was made. Within different categories, the obtaining of beneficial results 
was evidenced due to the use of innovative technologies or methods. Some of the main results were: reduction in feed 
cost of up to 21%, increase in the size and weight of aquaculture species of up to 15% and 23% respectively, and 
energy savings of up to 58%, which demonstrates the obtaining benefits after the implementation of modern 
procedures.

1. Introduction
In recent years, aquaculture has been growing as an alternative for obtaining fish worldwide, reaching 46% in 2018. 
Asia is by far the main producing region, while Latin America and parts of Africa show constant growth, its production

On the other hand, there are also opportunities when talking about the use of new technologies and techniques, as they 
provide noticeable improvements in aquaculture, but this must go hand in hand with properly trained staff so that they 
can implement them according to their needs and boundaries. In this way, a better quality product can be obtained in 
greater quantities that can, in turn, provide a greater competitiveness in the market. 
It should be noted that the acquisition of automation technologies not only requires trained personnel, but also requires 
adequate infrastructure and investment capital, which often means relatively high costs at the beginning of the project. 
That is why municipal and regional authorities should be encouraged to carry out campaigns and support programs 
for fish farmers who often can’t afford such amounts, since this sector is in a global growth trend and can represent a 
very large economic benefit for the country. 
There are also many opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of aquaculture farming. For example, it has 
been shown in the investigation that there are reflux systems that can benefit the effluents of aquaculture farms, 
improving the efficiency of the use of water, therefore lowering the consumption. Another approach would be to reuse 
fish scraps and use them to make fish feed, contributing to the circular economy and saving costs, which has been 
mentioned in previous articles. The nature of advances in aquaculture go hand in hand with environmental care, given 
its focus on efficiency and productivity. All in all, there are many ways to improve aquaculture farming and it can 
become a very important activity in the near future. It's a matter of knowing what tools are at our disposal and how 
we can implement them to obtain the most out of the marine resources.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to develop a multi-criteria decision-making framework to evaluate the performance of the 
Indian libraries by considering all the performance criteria simultaneously. The proposed multi-criteria decision-
making framework consists of three methods: Fuzzy Delphi method (FDM), Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process 
(FAHP), and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) multi-criteria decision-
making methods. These methods are applied for the analysis. Total holdings of resources (books and audio Visuals) 
is identified as the most important criteria among the eleven criteria followed by the seating capacity. The proposed 
multi-criteria decision-making framework in this study offers a useful tool for helping library management to solve 
performance related issues.

Abstract 
 
Between 2020 and 2022, an extensive number of papers about the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed to help 
authorities in the decision-making process to tackle the pandemic. One of the key functions to achieving a timely 
response to all the activities is scheduling. Therefore, this paper presents a literature review of all the research 
regarding scheduling and the COVID-19 outbreak. The search was conducted in SCOPUS and snowballing, gathering 
a total of 323 papers. A systematic review was conducted, and 43 articles were included. This literature review is 
classified into five sections: vaccines, testing, developed tools, healthcare scheduling, and others. It was found that 
the scheduling function is mainly concentrated on designing vaccination strategies. The discussion section provides 
insights from the literature, including descriptive analysis, used methods, and implemented models.  
 
Keywords 
Scheduling, Vaccine Allocation, COVID-19, Vaccination and Literature Review. 
 
1. Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted almost every single area of human life, not only hitting the healthcare system but 
bringing out a global ripple effect where livelihood, economy, and supply chains were highly compromised (Olivares-
Aguila & Vital-Soto 2021). Therefore, governments started implementing different policies to control the spread of 
the virus and have relied on vaccination campaigns as the best strategy to fight the pandemic. 
 
Implementing optimal strategies that allow a better performance of the vaccine administration is necessary to 
guarantee the correct allocation of different resources. Scheduling allows allocating scarce resources to activities to 
optimize one or more performance measures (Pinedo 2005). In the vaccine supply chain (VSC), many different stages 
make vaccine administration possible. With the help of different techniques, scheduling has been a crucial element in 
the success of this supply chain. This situation has encouraged researchers from different areas to contribute with 
models, simulations, and solutions that can help to predict a better allocation of scarce resources.  
 
This paper presents several research works that include scheduling in the VSC. Additionally, scheduling has been 
implemented in similar areas like testing and healthcare scheduling which are also included in the literature review. 
The scope of this literature review presents the following preliminary search (Figure 1), which was generated with the 
complete initial database using VOSviewer (www.vosviewer.com, accessed on 3 June 2022). In Figure 1, two main 
clusters can be appreciated. The green group (A) presents an epidemiological perspective, whereas the red group (B) 
depicts an optimization approach. This paper focuses on this last cluster, where some keywords such as vaccine 
allocation, policy, and mathematical model are highlighted. Within this context, this paper intends to provide an 
answer to the following research questions:","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022

Furthermore, scheduling has also been implemented in “Testing” due to its close correlation with the infection’s 
identification, strengthening the researcher’s intention to develop alternatives to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
testing facilities, the role of scheduling has been related to queuing theory, facilities, and resource allocation. 
Moreover, three papers about technology to optimize resource allocation were included in the “Developed tools” 
group, highlighting the importance of artificial intelligence and information technology tools to speed up decision-
making. Finally, the group “Others” includes a drone allocation and a manufacturing scheduling problem directly 
related to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
This literature review has found that most of the papers present a model, a simulation, and a case study to demonstrate 
the optimality of the proposal. However, most of the reviewed literature does not mention critical drivers to link the 
proposed models to reality (e.g., which authorities to give the information to). Additionally, implementing digital 
twins could contribute to a better understanding of the models and strategies before their execution. Another insight 
from this literature review is that most papers work with a “limited number of available vaccines,” which was the 
situation at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is a reality that a sufficient number of vaccines 
will be available in the future, and strategies that consider an unlimited number of available vaccines and mixed 
vaccination campaigns (i.e. flu, COVID-19, etc.) will be needed. Furthermore, almost none of the papers considered 
models with booster doses and children, which are the most recent stages of vaccination campaigns.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Between 2020 and 2022, a large amount of research on the COVID-19 pandemic has been developed to understand 
better and help authorities tackle the outbreak. This literature review showed how scheduling models and simulations 
could contribute to the decision-making process toward the best strategies to target desired objectives (e.g., minimizing 
mortality and maximizing vaccinated people). Although the findings of this literature review are clearly clustered, it 
is essential to mention that some of the included literature does not implement scheduling from an optimization 
perspective. Still, their contributions are highly necessary for developing accurate scheduling models. For instance, 
some papers focus on arranging appointments based on people’s preferences, providing further researchers with more 
accuracy in the appointment scheduling models. 
 
Limitations of this research are regarding the selection process of the documents, classification, and interpretation of 
them, which could lead to biases given the human intervention.

Abstract 
 
Advanced Manufacturing Technology (AMT) encircles the deployment of innovative technologically-based practices 
to improve processes and products across various manufacturing industries. Advanced manufacturing technology 
covers process technologies that are used to produce cutting-edge technologies and process technologies associated 
with computer-integrated manufacturing, robotics and automation technology. Organisations that adopt AMT are 
characterised by the pace at which the deployment of innovative technologically-based practices is selected and 
implemented in order to improve the organisations’ activities and end-products. Hence, some organisations are still 
struggling to implement AMT practices for improvement. Therefore, the following question needs to be researched: 
How well is the workforce equipped to embrace the implementation of AMT, and what are the critical factors and 
benefits of AMT? To answer this question, a conceptual framework was developed to mainly consider manufacturing 
organisations concerned with deploying the AMT in some of their activities, hoping to significantly improve processes 
and products, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction 
The 21st century has seen the birth of various innovative technologies in multiple industries worldwide. Advanced 
manufacturing technology is one of them, and it concerns using innovative, creative and cutting edge technologically-
based practices to improve the quality of products and processes in any given organisation (Brocal et al. 2018). These 
practices are becoming the norm today as they give an edge to organisations to influence competition. Any 
manufacturing organisation committed to bringing innovative change, improving the quality of its activities, and 
remaining competitive in the global market has no option but to embrace the practices of advanced manufacturing 
technology (Qian et al. 2017). 
 
Advanced manufacturing depends on the latest revolutionised technology practices that warrant agility, flexibility, as 
well as the propensity to configure. For instance, semiconductors, biomanufacturing, advanced materials,

According to the results of joint research undertaken by (Kumar and  Gurtu 2021), the highest-ranked benefit generated 
by the adoption of advanced manufacturing technology is “Manufacturing flexibility”, which means, in an 
undetermined business situation or condition, organisations need to develop and rely on flexible manufacturing 
processes in order to become resilient and sustainable. This allows manufacturing organisations to consistently 
improve performance and attract new opportunities from the business market. 
 
Moreover, among the most significant benefits of ATMs is their integration. The ability for computers to electronically 
and digitally connect to different workstations and machines within a manufacturing organisation is critical when it 
comes to implementing AMTs. A single integrated system is set up to control and monitor an organization's operations, 
from the processing of raw materials to when the finished goods are ready for delivery to the customers (Boyer 1994). 
The integration of AMTs can concern electronically integrating transactions, functions, or processes from various 
departments within the same organisation, for example, between marketing, production/manufacturing (Through 
CNC) and product design (like CAD) (Jonsson 2000; Diaz et al. 2003). 
 
3. Final remarks 
In this era, organisations use technologically-based innovations to compete in the global market. Organisations leverage 
the advantages and benefits that come with adopting advanced manufacturing technologies to improve their operating 
systems and manufacturing processes and ultimately improve products and services to constantly attract current and 
new customers. It’s important to highlight that for the implementation of advanced manufacturing technologies to be 
regarded as a success, organisations have to make sure employees are provided with appropriate training programmes 
so they can master the use of AMT practices. Because the practices of AMT are becoming incredibly complex, 
therefore, well-elaborated training programmes have to be put in place in order to improve employee performance so 
they can effectively contribute to the production of high-quality products. The knowledge of the critical factors such as 
top management commitment, organisational structure, integration of processes and employee participation are 
essential for a successful implementation of AMTs. Lack of expertise or skills regarding the use of the practiced 
technologies mentioned in table 1 has the potential to turn an organisation into a cost-generating entity which can lead 
to bankruptcy. Hence, organisations have to take appropriate standing, including evaluating financial conditions to reap 
the full benefits that come along with the implementation of the advanced technologies.

Abstract 
Previous research has been using Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) model, but the model does not cater many 
related aspects about continuation to use, therefore this research aims to study the continuance intention of digital 
wallet by using Extended ECM Model. In this paper, satisfaction, confirmation, and perceived usefulness, with 
additional of promotion, mobility, and cost saving are used as the independent variable to measure the dependent 
variable of intention to continue use digital wallet. The data were collected from 236 respondents between age 18 to 
55 years old who live in Jabodetabek area that use the top five digital wallet in Indonesia (Ovo, GoPay, Shoppe Pay, 
Dana, Link Aja). The data were evaluated by utilizing structural equation modelling approach. The outcome show that 
perceived usefulness does not significantly affect continuance intention of using digital wallet. However, satisfaction, 
promotion, mobility, and cost saving significantly affect the continuation use of digital wallet. Also, perceived 
usefulness and confirmation significantly affect the satisfaction of using digital wallet. Furthermore, satisfaction 
significantly mediates positive relationship between perceived usefulness with continuance intention and confirmation 
with continuance intention. This study provides practical implications for digital wallet provider that satisfaction is 
the factor that influence the continuance intention, not perceived usefulness.

1. Introduction
Trends nowadays, technology, and innovation have shaped customer expectations. Customers are making choices 
based on anything that are exposed to them. This also includes on how customer do transactions and paying utilities. 
Digital wallet company are following any changes happened to customer expectations and have been trying to match 
them. They collect customer data, update the information, and change the way on how they can provide to match 
customer expectations.  
According to Ariffin, et al (2021), digital wallet is a cashless system by using smartphone that enable user to transfer 
or make payment conveniently. The system utilizes and apply QR code or peer-to-peer (P2P) approach to do the 
transaction. By using QR code or payment system inside the application, customers have the ability to transfer funds 
between themselves. Banks and non-banks institutions have been trying to compete to give better performance and 
more convenience to the customers. 
As of January 2021, Indonesia had a population of 274.9 million people (Kemp, 2021). In 2020, more than half (67%) 
Indonesian people have been using a smartphone; and this Indonesia smartphone user is expected to grow to reach 
239 million by 2026 (Nurhayati-Wolff, 2021). The market potential of digital wallet transaction is forecasted to expand

6. Conclusion 
This paper determines the factor that impact continuation use of digital wallet, with Extended ECM model, using 
promotion, mobility, and cost saving. Nine out of ten hypotheses are supported. The remaining one hypothesis about 
the effect of perceived usefulness to continuation use of digital wallet is rejected. Extended variables, namely 
promotion, mobility, and cost saving factor positively affects the continuation use of digital wallet. Thus, factors that 
impact the continuance intention of digital wallet is confirmed in Indonesia. 
 
This study contributes to existing theory by observing the continuance intention after adoption of digital wallet. 
Furthermore, this study contributes in observing continuance usage of digital wallet, by adding extended variables, 
namely promotion, mobility, and cost saving, to the ECM model. Very few studies analyze the effect of the extended 
variables, especially in digital wallet continuance intention to use. 
 
To increase continuance intention, digital wallet provider should not only increase usefulness of the application; but 
they should make users are satisfied with the experience of using digital wallet. This can be done for example, by 
creating an efficient UI/UX or by smoothing the API; so that the experience of using digital wallet can be satisfactory. 
Moreover, digital wallet provider can also use the benefit offered by promotion activity and cost saving, because it 
shows that both factors help in retention of digital wallet user. Lastly, digital wallet provider can also cooperate with 
lots of merchant since mobility also affect digital wallet user retention. By having lots of merchants that accept digital 
payment, users will feel that they can use digital wallet anywhere. 
 
This study has some limitations that should be considered. The cross-sectional method was used in this study, so it 
only collects the response in one specific time. A longitudinal study is recommended in the future research to explore 
how our respondent could change their response over time. Furthermore, additional variable such as merchant network 
and risk factor might be added in the future research.

Abstract 
Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are expected to solve transport congestion in big cities as well as increasing safety for 
road users and improving mobility efficiency for the public. Thus, it is only natural that smart cities would like to 
adopt AV as part of their development. One such smart city is Bumi Serpong Damai (BSD) City, located in Tangerang, 
Banten, Indonesia. The purpose of this paper is to provide insights into adoption factors that are important for public 
perceptions towards AV and their influences toward intention to use AV based on the Technology Acceptance Model. 
The researchers did quantitative surveys to people that have experienced AV first-hand on perceptions of the benefits, 
both personal and social benefits, mobility-related efficiencies, and safety concerns as the key AV adoption factors. 
The researchers understand that AV have been tested on several developed countries before, but this is the first trial 
run for public in a developing country. This study found several evidences on factors that that have positive correlation 
with the public attitude towards and intention to use AV as a new technology in a developing country.

1. Introduction
Our world is seeing a wave of urbanization that has changed the area where people live. In present time, there are 
more people living in big cities instead of rural areas. (Ritchie, H. & Roser, M., 2019). Based on data from United 
Nation, it is estimated that 55% of the world’s population is living in urban areas around the world and it is estimated 
that this number will rise to 68% by 2050.  
Indonesia, as a developing country in the ASEAN region (World Bank, 2022), is also following that trend. It is 
estimated that around 56% of Indonesians live in urban areas and that this number is estimated to continue to grow up 
to 73% by 2050. (United Nations, 2018). 
With this wave of urbanization, mobility has become one of the key factors affecting urban areas or big cities citizens’ 
well-being and life-quality (Melis et al., 2015). In addition, by considering our highly motorized and car-reliant 
society, urban mobility is also a source of major problems in urban areas, such as: traffic congestion, air pollution, 
travel time and several other factors associated with moving people and goods around (Antonialli, 2019). These major 
challenges need to be tackled on so that they will not pose as threats to urban living (Clausen, 2017), and big cities

The public also believe that AV is easy to use, and this partially impact their intention to use AV, but with a positive 
attitude towards AV, their intention to use AV is even higher. Based on the predominantly positive attitudes towards 
AV and intention to use AV from members of the general public that have tried riding AV, this study concludes that 
majority of the public in Indonesia welcome the idea of using AV as an alternative of future method of transportation. 
Finally, findings in this study imply that public attitude towards AV is very important on their intention to use AV. 
Thus, future test runs, be it from the private sector or from the government, should focus on factors that could increase 
public positive attitudes toward AV, such as further proving that AV could help reduce traffic congestions in general 
roads or that usage of AV could help to reduce pollution in big cities in Indonesia. Future providers of AV should also 
take into account factors that have been proven to increase public positive attitude towards AV, and increase them to 
next level, for example no mandatory seatbelts could imply that AV are as safe as other public transports, as most 
public transports currently in use do not force their passengers to wear seatbelts.  
 
The first limitation to note is that although the testing was done in a mix traffic condition, in reality the AV was 
running in a closed environment with only 2 stopping points. The implication of this condition is that we should wait 
for the AV to be tested running on a more public road to study whether both the attitude and intention to use AV from 
the public remain positive. The other implication is that it remained to be seen whether more stopping points will 
generate more interest from the public to use AV.  
 
Second, as this run was an initial public test, it was free for the public. Further studies on how efficient it is to run the 
AV as a public transport in comparison to other existing public transports should be conducted, as pricing or the 
willingness to pay factor could be an important factor on the public's attitude and intention to use AV (Skeete, 2018; 
Pettigrew et al., 2019).  
 
Last, due to this trial run for the public was done with ARMA, an AV that is meant as a public transport, the perceptions 
of the respondents were limited to the usage of AV as a public transport. We would like to recommend for further 
studies to be conducted to study the public perception on AV for private use or whether people that have tried AV 
would like to own an AV of their own.

Abstract 
Currently, Indonesia's manufacturing sector is expanding at a respectable rate. This encourages business owners to 
focus on the quality of their products. Good production standards will result in high-quality items. A consumer-
satisfying product can enhance the company's sales. This study was conducted in a plant that has produced brake 
linings exclusively since 2002. Cracks and bloating faults are still present on the surface of the brake linings at this 
manufacturer; therefore, changes are necessary. The goal of this study was to identify the types of defects, quantify 
the degree of faults, identify and analyze the variables generating defects, and make recommendations for improving 
the quality of the company's brake lining manufacture. As evaluated by the sigma value, the current production quality 
of the Non-Asbestos 2 (NA2) type brake lining is 3.93 sigma. Utilizing the phases of define, measure, analysis, 
improve, and control, six sigma’s is employed (DMAIC). This study's outcomes include proposed enhancements and 
comparisons of sigma values before and after implementation. The conclusion of this study is that there are two types 
of defects, namely cracks and bloating, resulting from of a number of factors. Standard operating procedures (SOP), 
checklists, standard forms for measuring raw materials, and investment in more advanced machines are proposed as 
means of improvement. The implementation findings yielded a sigma value of 4.59 (an increase of 0.66 sigma from 
before).

1. Introduction
Currently, the manufacturing industry in Indonesia is increasing at a decent rate. This expansion resulted in the 
formation of numerous manufacturing enterprises, which intensified commercial competition. This motivates business 
owners to focus on product quality to satisfy client demands. There are seven types of waste that arise in the industrial 
process. Waste of overproduction, inventory, defects, transportation, motion, waiting, and over processing are the 
seven wastes (Sari, 2018). This level of waste must be decreased in the production process, if not, it will impede the 
production process and prevent efficient output. PT. Indolining was established in 2002 and specialized in the 
production of brake linings. Brake lining serves as a barrier to friction between two iron plates, notably the brake shoe 
and brake drum, in order to lower braking speed and stop the rotation of the car's tires. The brake linings produced 
also have several types of products including types CP, CP3, 51 HS, Non Asbest (NA), Non Asbest 2 (NA2), Non 
Asbest Australia (NA Australia) and TVS. PT. Indolining has a quality control staff, although quality control is 
confined to the operator physically inspecting items for defects. If a product is damaged, for instance, employees will 
determine whether it can still be repaired; if it cannot be repaired, it will be destroyed and reprocessed. In producing 
brake lining at PT. Indolining has waste that occurs, namely defects, where defective products are found in their 
production. Table 1 contains information on product defects.

Based on the comparison of control chart P, it can be seen that numerous productions were still outside the control 
limits in the first, fourth, and fifth months prior to implementation. However, after implementation, the proportion of 
defective brake linings of type NA2 remains within the control limits. Prior to the implementation of the proposed 
enhancement, the DPMO value was 7,454,376 with a Sigma value of 3.93 Sigma. In contrast, the DPMO value is 
985.2217 with a Sigma value of 4.59 after the execution of the proposed enhancement. By increasing the Sigma value 
during the production of NA2-type brake linings, it is evident that the proposed change has a positive effect on 
production quality. According to the findings of interviews with Mr. Abdul, a member of the production floor crew, 
and Mr. Onggo, the production manager, the availability of a number of proposed changes is sufficient to assist staff 
or operators with the production process. The existence of a raw material dosage form clarifies the raw material dosage 
form for personnel. In addition, the existence of a checklist for the quality of raw materials aids personnel in controlling 
the quality of raw materials, and standard operating procedures for hot press machines aid personnel in operating hot 
press machines with greater care. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In the production of brake linings of the NA2 type, there are two primary categories of faults. The two forms of 
problems are brake lining surface swelling and brake lining surface cracking. During the production of NA2-type 
brake lining, a number of reasons contribute to the product's deficiency, including improper material composition, 
improper temperature management, and varying operator hardness test results. There are a number of suggestions for 
overcoming the issues that lead to the product's deficiency, including the proposed standard formula table form, the 
proposed checklist for the quality of raw materials, the proposed standard operating procedure (SOP) for the operation 
of the hot press machine, and the proposed investment for a more advanced measuring instrument, namely Brinell 
Digital. Hardness Tester Zonhow model LHB-3000A, with the proposed addition of an abrasive wear quality test 
using the Dongguan Hongtuo model DH-TA-01 abrasion testing equipment. 
 
The DPMO value for the manufacture of brake lining type NA2 from January to June 2021 is 7,454,376 with a sigma 
value of 3.93 sigma. With these figures, the NA2 type brake lining manufacture quality can still be enhanced. After 
implementing the recommended enhancement, the DPMO value reduced to 985.2217, resulting in an increase in the 
sigma value to 4.59. This demonstrates that the proposed enhancement has a positive effect on production quality. In 
addition to the conclusion, the company can also be given the following recommendations for producing the NA2 
type brake lining: considering the proposed improvement to purchase a Brinell Digital Hardness Tester machine so 
that measurement results between operators are more accurate and feasible; and considering the proposed 
improvement. Purchase the Dongguan Hongtuo Abrasion Testing Machining machine, type DH-TA-01, to add to the 
abrasive wear quality test. If the standard is decided by the hardness test, it is judged insufficient, so the NA2 type 
brake lining product requires an additional test, namely the abrasive wear test.

Abstract 
In this quickly evolving digital era, every industry is undergoing digital revolutions, which have an impact on business. 
This investigation aims to look into the effects of the digital supply chain on performance (in regards to product quality 
and cost reduction performance), with particular emphasis on the automobile industry in Indonesia. Additionally, the 
analysis investigates the moderating effect that lean practices have on the link between these factors. A total of 120 
questionnaires were gathered, and analysis was performed using the PLS-SEM method. The findings indicate that the 
digital supply chain has a considerable impact on product quality and cost reduction performance. In addition, the 
results indicate that lean practices moderate the relationship between the digital supply chain and product quality 
performance, but not cost reduction performance. This finding contribute to the comprehension of supply chain 
management bridging the knowledge gap in the digital supply chain. Particular attention has been paid to the 
previously unstudied influence of operational performance within the framework of the automotive industry.

1. Introduction
Accelerated technological growth and the phenomenon of digitalization have become the standard in recent years in 
all industries. Every sector, including supply chain, is impacted by digital transformations (Nasiri et al., 2020). 
Emerging digital technologies are reshaping existing and future supply chain patterns significantly (Prakash Agrawal, 
2018). A survey carried out by McKinsey and Company (2017) discovered significant variations in the degree of 
digitalization across industries and that businesses felt challenged by the pressures of digital technology. According 
to projections, a company's revenue could decrease by a third in the coming years if it does not take additional 
measures to counteract digital demand and rivalry from more technologically adept competitors. As digitalization and 
digital transformation are difficult to handle, many businesses are ignorant of how they might implement new digital 
technology into their business operations. Despite the tremendous opportunities afforded by digital technology, many 
businesses continue to underinvest in them, with the majority of their revenue still coming from traditional sources. 
In addition, the digital supply chain is still in its infancy, thus there is still ample room for further research 
(Büyükozkan and Gocer, 2018). 
Today most supply chains operate according to traditional standardized processes including such plan, source, 
manufacture, distribute and return. Each of these components is increasingly revitalized as a result of technological 
advancements. Increased competition in supply chains has driven businesses to intelligently upgrade their production 
methods (Kamble et al., 2019). Büyüközkan and Göçer (2018) define the digital supply chain as “an intelligent best-
fit technological system that is based on the capability of massive data disposal and excellent cooperation and 
communication for digital hardware, software, and networks to support and synchronize interaction between 
organizations by making services more valuable, accessible and affordable with consistent, agile and effective 
outcomes”.

it forces the perpetrators to constantly think about how to survive and share their business market share. Meeting 
consumer needs daily produces more transaction data over time, resulting in a set of databases. However, many

FP Growth Algorithm  
The search for association rules was carried out in two stages, namely the search for frequent item sets and the 
compilation of rules . And for the frequent itemset search conducted in this study, the FP-Growth method was used. 
Where FP - Growth is an alternative algorithm that can be used to determine an item set frequency in a data set. 
 
Then to measure the importance or not of an association rule, it can be seen with two parameters, namely the support 
value (supporting value) and the confidence value (certainty value). The support value indicates the level of dominance 
of the itemset from the whole data, and because in determining the itemset in this study using FP- Growth , the support 
value setting is regulated in the FP - Growth process . While the confidence value is a measure of how much valid or 
not an association rule is. The minimum support value used is 50%, while the minimum confidence value is 95%. The 
following is the association rule process using the RapidMiner application (Figure 8).

Associate processing rule by using a minimum support t of 50% produces a set of all itemset . The itemset is known 
by seeing whether the itemset has met the minimum support limit. The following are the results of the frequency item 
set shown in Table 4.

Abstract 
Early consideration of the future market environment of a new product favors its success. Therefore, the future 
environment and requirements derived from this must be considered in the development of a product. Foresight 
provides several instruments for identifying different potential future developments, according to the time horizon 
referenced in the development of the product. Especially for a medium to long-term time horizon, trends and scenarios 
are suitable. With scenarios, alternative environments of the future can be described and distinguished. In strategic 
product planning, future requirements are derived with the help of scenarios to enable a more efficient and often less 
expensive definition for a product. Due to a volatile market environment, the product must be adapted in many cases 
or fails to meet the future needs of customers, users or suppliers. There are several approaches to manage this 
uncertainty. However, there is a lack of an overview of common understandings. In this paper, 29 relevant publications 
were identified with a systematic literature review considering 382 publications. Six existing understandings were 
identified but they are not used consistently. Based on the commonalities, two key orientations were found: future-
robustness and future-orientation. With future-robustness, developments can be understood which results in products 
positioned robustly against several alternative futures. The products can be adapted to different future developments 
with minor adjustments. In contrast, with future-orientation the development is focused on a specific alternative future 
and thus the product design is made for one chosen solution concept. Therefore, product changes are effortful. 
Keywords 
Future robustness, future orientation, foresight, scenarios and product development. 
1. Introduction
The development of products is subject to prevailing market and technology-related uncertainties (Henderson and 
Clark 1990). Early consideration of the future market environment therefore favors the development of a successful 
product (Cooper and Kleinschmidt 1993). Methods of foresight such as the scenario technique represent a tool in the 
discussion of a potential future picture. Thereby scenarios can be created for the anticipation of the future environment 
or upcoming technologies on the product to be developed. Further on, it is possible to derive future requirements via 
scenarios (Meyer-Schwickerath 2014). However, there is no guarantee that an expected future will occur. Depending 
on the future space considered in each case, several futures can be described as probable. Accordingly, several 
different potential futures must be expected. It is therefore attempted to align the development of the products with

Abstract 
This paper presents a bi-objective multi-warehouse inventory optimization model for fresh produce, allowing 
transhipments between warehouses. Initially, we extended our previous proposed mixed-integer quadratic 
programming model by allowing transhipment between warehouses. Next, we introduce a bi-objective function, as 
there is a conflict between two cost components: energy cost of warehouses and product deterioration cost. In the bi-
objective model, the first objective minimizes energy costs of warehouses, preparation costs of warehouses, inventory 
holding costs and transhipment costs. The second objective aims to minimize the quantity of deteriorated products. 
We performed computational experiments using Gurobi optimization using a number of randomly generated instances 
under three different scenarios based on the value of transhipment costs compared with holding costs (lower, similar 
or higher). In the first phase of the computational experiments, we consider only transhipments between warehouses 
(not using the bi-objective function). These results show that considering lateral transhipments decrease the overall 
costs in all scenarios. Next, we repeat the computational experiments, using the bi-objective function and the 
transhipment between warehouses. We calculated the weighted sum of both objectives using nine different 
combinations of weights for the two objective functions testing on the same instances. The resulted pareto fronts 
provide a decision-making scheme for managers to decide on the best trade-off between warehousing and inventory 
costs (first objective) and the quantity of deteriorated products (second objective).

1. Introduction
The food industry in Australia is responsible for $117 billion per year and is increasing by more than 2% per year 
(Hogan, 2018). It is estimated that around one-third of the food produced for human consumption is lost globally, 
about 1.3 billion tons per year (FAO, 2011, Juliano et al., 2019). Many challenges are associated with the food supply 
chain resulting in food loss, from harvesting, inventory management, production, and distribution to delivery to the 
final customer. Particularly in fresh produce (fruit and vegetables), a central challenge is inventory management, 
which involves all the decisions related to storage between harvesting and market demand. Therefore, appropriate 
inventory management is essential. According to (Ivanov et al., 2017), inventory cost corresponds to 50% of the total 
capital invested by many businesses. 
Shukla and Jhakharia (2013), Lemma et al. (2014), Paam et al. (2016), and Janssen et al. (2016) are some examples 
of literature reviews in the area of food supply models, including production planning and inventory management 
considering perishable products. Shukla and Jhakharia (2013) introduce a literature review on the supply chain 
management of fresh produce. Lemma et al. (2014) focus on approaches to dealing with loss in the food supply chain, 
while Janssen et al. (2016) classify inventory models for deteriorating products. Finally, Paam et al. (2016) offer a

6. Conclusion 
This paper considered the multi-period, multi-product, multi-warehouse inventory control optimization problem for 
the inventory management of fresh produce. We have extended a proposed mixed-integer quadratic programming 
model (Pam et al., 2022), allowing transhipments between warehouses and presenting a bi-objective function. 
 
We tested the mathematical formulations in two phases. First, we tested the performance of the model only with 
transhipment between warehouses (without the bi-objective function). Next, we tested the model employing the bi-
objective function and transhipment between warehouses. For both computational tests, we used the mathematical 
optimisation software Gurobi using 25 instances randomly generated based on the case study from Pam et al. (2022). 
 
In the first phase of the computational experiments, the transhipment costs are divided into three categories, which are 
less, similar, or greater than the electricity costs. The results show that, independently of the transhipment cost, the 
overall inventory system costs are minimised. 
 
Finally, in the second phase, we conducted computational experiments using the model with the bi-objective function 
and allowing transhipment between warehouses. We have summed both objective functions with weights from w1=0.1 
and w2=0.9, to w1=0.9 and w2=0.1, and we presented the Pareto front results. The Pareto front results (Figure 1, 2 
and 3) shows the trade-offs between both objective functions, suggesting possible strategies to managers.

One of the limitations of this study is not considering supply uncertainties due to, for example, weather conditions. In 
addition, demand uncertainties and shortage allowance. Another limitation is the computational time needed to run 
mixed-integer programming problems using optimal methods, such as those available in software packages such as 
Gurobi. One possible extension is developing and implementing heuristics and metaheuristics to improve the 
computational efficiency when applying the model in larger instances of the problem.

Abstract 
As a new agitator of Supply Chain disruptions, COVID-19 global pandemic has significantly triggered an 
extraordinary series of shocks on food supply chains worldwide including bottlenecks in farm labor, processing, 
transportation, and logistics, as well as the significant swings in customer demand. Many of these strains are the 
consequences of policies enacted to prevent spreading the virus. The food industry is one of the important sectors in 
each economy. While the consequences of COVID-19 are still being felt, past experience has shown the necessity of 
a well-organized and foreseeable global trade environment in ensuring that food reaches people in need. In order to 
avoid the impending global food crisis, it's critical to examine how COVID-19 has impacted food supply networks 
and to discover the potential remedies. Hence, the main objectives of this literature analysis are to examine the nature 
of COVID-19's induced food supply chain disruptions in worldwide and to highlight strategies needed to mitigate the 
adverse effects of pandemic on the food supply chains as well as to enhance the resilience of worldwide food supply 
chains. This scrutiny has been conducted using a comprehensive and systematic review of literature published in 
relation to the impact of COVID-19 on food supply chains and this study included the content of 30 articles which 
were selected as per the Prisma approach. In reviewing the selected literature, steps of thematic analysis are considered 
to derive the major findings. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the adoption of emergency-preparedness 
procedures and the development of food supply chain contractual transactions across the worldwide nations. Without 
reverting to the previous state of food supply chains, novel experience resultant from COVID-19 emphasized the 
importance of building a smart food value chain with the involvement of all value adding stakeholders in order to 
ensure the resilience amidst and beyond the crisis.

1. Introduction
As a new agitator of supply chain (SC) disruptions, the COVID-19 global pandemic has significantly triggered an 
extraordinary series of shocks on the supply chains worldwide (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2020). The global pandemic 
situation has tremendously impacted on each area of the society and economy leading to a series of utterly novel 
decisions and policy-making settings for SC scholars and experts. SCs were put to the test in terms of resilience, 
flexibility, and recovery throughout the pandemic, stressing the crucial importance of resilience in managing SCs in 
this unpredictable world (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2020). Supply chain disruptions are high-impact, low-frequency 
occurrences that alter the SC's structural design and have a substantial impact on performance (Ivanov et al., 2019).

5. Conclusion
COVID-19 had the possibility to worsen the poverty and malnutrition, particularly in developing countries with 
inadequate social safety nets. COVID-19 resulted in travel restrictions of laborers, consumer demand fluctuations, 
shutting down the food manufacturing facilities, restricted food trade legislation, and financial limits in the food supply 
chain. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the significance of guaranteeing public food security during such 
extraordinary economic shocks, as well as the risk of exacerbating existing food insecurity issues in the countries 
which need to be addressed effectively. While there have been obvious difficulties and issues in developing countries, 
food supply chains in the developed countries have shown remarkable resilience and robustness in the face of COVID-
19. While the consequences of COVID-19 are still being felt, past experience has exhibited the necessity of a well-
organized and foreseeable global trade environment in ensuring that food reaches people in need. Exemptions from
lockdown restrictions for food and agriculture, measures to ensure the health of agriculture and food workers,
loosening visa restrictions to attract foreign seasonal workers, and administrative flexibility were among the policy
measures taken to protect the functioning of food supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the adoption
of emergency-preparedness procedures and the development of food supply chain contractual transactions across the
worldwide nations. Immediate economic assistance initiatives required to avoid this health catastrophe from escalating 
into a food crisis, and governments should participate in better data collection in order to equip policymakers with the
adequate information so that they can form policies that successfully develop comprehensive food value chains.
Without reverting to the previous state of food supply chains, novel experience resultant from COVID-19 emphasized
the importance of building a smart food value chain with the involvement of all value adding stakeholders in order to
ensure the resilience amidst and beyond the crisis.  These lessons learnt from the COVID-19 epidemic will be valuable 
in dealing with the impending food crisis and the further research on the ripple effects of disruptions in food supply
systems is needed to enlighten the prospective solutions.

Abstract 
The research performs an analysis of waste management in the fishing industry and its relationship with the Peruvian 
industry through a systematic review of the literature and the use of the VOSviewer software to generate a network of 
co-occurrences with the aim of identifying the most relevant topics of interest in the scientific community. The present 
work is analyzed in three periods of time that explain the evolution of the Peruvian fishing industry: 2001-2011, 2012-
2019 and 2020-2021, in addition to the collection of articles related to the subject of study, a selection of the best 
articles is made in relation to the number of citations and the prominence percentile for the most impactful topics of 
waste management in the fishing industry, finally it is discussed how it could generate a broader vision of the new 
opportunities of waste management through implement in the Peruvian fishing sector.

1. Introduction
In Peru, the fishing industry has had an evolution in its development during the last two decades. In the economic 
aspect, between the years 2001 and 2010, the latter had a considerably lower level of capture compared to previous 
years, which resulted in a decrease in the level of production by 37% (Peruvian Export Promotion Commission and 
Tourism [PROMPERU] 2011). On the other hand, between 2012 and 2019, capture fishing levels remained in the 
range of 89.5 and 96.4 million tons (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2018), this last one dates from 2018 
in which the FAO highlights the 10 main world producers of capture fisheries for this high amount of fishing achieved 
during this period, of which the seven main countries represent about 50% of the total fishing production catch 
worldwide where Peru ranked third (FAO 2020). Finally, during these last two years in which the impact caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic is known, the reduction of activities led to a decrease in exports and imports, as a 
consequence, the GDP fell by 11.1% during the 2020 (Central Reserve Bank of Peru [BCRP] 2020). The fishing 
sector, in particular, has been strongly affected since the quarantine was declared as the fishing fleets stopped their 
operations. This event generated a negative impact on the Peruvian economy (Aroni 2020). However, by the end of 
2020, the fishing sector improved its economic situation compared to other industries. According to the National 
Institute of Statistics and Informatics of Peru (INEI 2020), this sector grew by 108.54% due to the reduction of 
restrictions on economic activities and thanks to these results, as well as the operation of other activities in the 
construction and manufacturing sector, the GDP increased in December by 0.51%.

industries are organic, so they are compatible with most biological treatments to treat them. However, some methods 
such as activated sludge are not efficient, since they involve a high use of energy associated with the use of oxygen 
and do not allow recycling of the nutrients present in the wastewater. 
 
There is also a lot of research about managing wastewater, through its reuse. For this topic, the authors mention in 7 
articles that the reuse of water can be considered to treat effluents without damaging product quality and hygiene, 
although sometimes this method is not accepted due to public health problems. The main factor in the reuse of 
wastewater is that the effluent from the process unit meets the influence requirements of another unit process. In 
addition, the articles state that fish processing factories, after their respective biological treatment, generate wastewater 
that can be reused in agriculture as liquid fertilizer, being able to promote plant growth since the main components 
are organic and nutritious substances, as well as they do not have the presence of toxic substances or known 
carcinogenic materials. 
 
Just as waste treatments are discussed, production can also be chosen, in this case, 5 articles investigated the production 
of chitin. Chitin is a component found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans, containing 15-20% of dry weight. The 
production of this component in the fish industries has turned out to be environmentally attractive and economically 
feasible. Likewise, chitosan, which is derived from chitin, has become a highly regarded product for treating spoilage 
fish industry products, as the substance is non-toxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable. In addition to this, it has 
antibacterial and antioxidant properties, serves as a gel enhancer, coagulating agent, etc. Therefore, it can be 
implemented in these industries to improve the quality of products and human nutrition. 
 
Finally, during the last few years, considerable research has been done on biogas production. In 7 articles, the authors 
comment that biogas can be used to produce thermal energy through a burner or also as fuel to produce thermal, 
mechanical, or electrical energy within a treatment plant. In the fishing industry, biogas can be produced at the time 
of using fish waste silage, the latter being obtained from a fish processor. It should be added that the best quality of 
fish waste silage was obtained through a mixture of these with waste from bread production. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The fishing industry in Peru is considered of great importance for all the results that it generates annually both 
economically, socially, technologically, etc. However, to this day the environmental problem prevails based on the 
way in which companies manage their waste, as well as the presence of informality that delays the formal development 
of this sector. 
 
During the last two decades, the worldwide scientific community has been researching and proposing methods and 
strategies to manage the waste generated in the fishing sector. The use of the VOSviewer tool allowed knowing these 
methods through the topics that cover them. It was learned that the topics are diverse in each scientific community; 
however, there are common themes between them which generates a greater intrigue to know what they propose and 
why it is so much discussed today. 
 
Based on two selection criteria, it was possible to determine the most relevant topics in waste management issues, 
among which wastewater treatment, anaerobic and biological treatment, wastewater reuse and chitin and biogas 
production stand out. Through these topics, a discussion could be held about how they could contribute and generate 
a change in the Peruvian fishing industry. Based on the data analyzed from said industry, it could be suggested that it 
has the potential to invest, develop and improve these waste management methods since, according to the authors, 
these issues have the capacity to generate environmental benefits because it has a high effectiveness to treat waste; 
social benefits because they generate greater sustainability with marine resources as well as greater safety for the 
community and, finally, economic benefits since in addition to reducing costs and optimizing water and energy 
consumption, they can provide the option of creating new production lines by reusing and giving a commercial value 
to certain waste that was previously destined only to be treated and subsequently discarded.

Abstract 
The objective of this research article is to present the results of the literature review of furfural production, to determine 
the optimal production conditions, potential uses and relevance for the scientific community between 2016 to 2021. 
To analyze the problem, 2-time horizons were defined, from 2015 - 2018 and 2019 - 2021 with which a systematic 
mapping was performed. For the results and discussion of the findings, the 11 most relevant articles of the total 
collected were chosen, considering the number of citations per article and their percentile of prominence from 
databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. Then, the VOSviewer software was used to generate the co-occurrence 
network of the topics present to visualize the most relevant keywords for each year and in each database. Finally, the 
research work is concluded by commenting on the scope of furfural use in industries, the raw materials with the highest 
pentose content and the development of improvements in production to optimize furfural yield.

The articles investigated dealt with the various methods to obtain furfural with different raw materials, and also lay 
the foundations of the benefits that the use of furfural as a platform product can bring to obtain various products; 
among the most outstanding ones, biofuel (Mariscal et al., 2016). 
The articles found within the first horizon of study demonstrate their concern for the environment and the interest in 
finding eco-friendly alternatives that can help in a potential energy crisis in case the oil industry is affected in the 
future. In addition, they establish the uses of furfural, emphasizing the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution and the 
use of organic waste from the agricultural industry. 
However, although their experiments were highly successful in determining the best process for obtaining furfural 
(acid hydrolysis) and the raw material with the highest xylose value, their scope is limited, since they do not go beyond 
their discoveries and the benefit of reducing environmental impacts. 
On the other hand, for the range of years from 2019 to 2021, a concern for the current environmental context is also 
observed. However, there is a shift with respect to the production of furfuraldehyde. In this interval, it focuses on 
improving the process for obtaining this product, such as changing the raw material, different types of acid as a 
catalyst, the number of processes for treatment, among others. The research is progressively being carried out because 
they not only see furfural as a use for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, etc., but also explore the world of 
biofuels, opting for a more environmentally friendly and lower cost solution (Ntimbani et al., 2021). 
 
5. Conclusion 
From the bibliographic review and the exhaustive analysis of scientific research of the highest category quartiles, it 
can be seen that obtaining furfural has been a topic with little relevance in recent years compared to other research on 
biofuels. However, its importance and industrial value has led to the development of more and more projects, since it 
is a platform product on which many valuable products can be produced in different industries. 
 
The production of furfural is a potential focus of opportunities to optimize the performance of companies. Its value is 
centered on its versatility of benefits, reduction of environmental impact as it is a product derived from the treatment 
of residual biomass and a substitute for petroleum derivatives, improving the performance of the activities to be 
employed.

From the articles reviewed, it is concluded that the interest in developing products that can substitute petroleum and 
its derivatives is a latent and continuous theme. The aim is to optimize the production of furfural with alternative 
processes and various catalysts in order to develop the best way to obtain this compound and use it to solve the current 
energy problem. 
According to what was reviewed with the use of tools such as Vosviewer and databases such as Scopus and Web of 
Science, the articles with the characteristic of quartile 1 had a greater informative value for the development of the 
research. Because they used data, keywords and metrics that could be aligned with the proposed objectives.

Abstract 
In order to remain competitive in the long term and push the efficiency of the company to its limits, entrepreneurs are 
increasingly open to the idea of implementing Industry 4.0 in SMEs to envision a connected SME4.0. As the biggest 
challenge encountered is to get started, this article aims to make it easier for SME entrepreneurs to decide on the 
implementation of new technologies, mentioning the latest technological trends, the advantages of being SME4.0 and 
specifically process 4.0, listing the last major barriers that hinder the implementation of Industry 4.0, and which mainly 
reside in the lack of skills of employees on new technologies and predictive maintenance, high costs of setting up new 
technologies and long process of return on investment.  
Keywords 
Industry 4.0, SME 4.0, Challenges and barriers, New technologies, Predictive maintenance 
1. Introduction
The characterized parts of Industry 4.0 lead to general areas of activity, which are of particular interest to the discipline 
of business and information systems engineering (BISE) (Lasi et al. 2007).  
For the discipline of BISE, interesting starting points arise particularly concerning the area of the integration of the 
basic physical system and the software system (Suchergebnisse 2022). New operations using real-time information 
via RFID, sensors, etc. allow advanced integration into various systems. To facilitate the exchange of information, a 
multitude of industrial communication networks have evolved over the years, starting in the 1980s. It is remarkable 
that these developments, in many cases, have replicated and welcomed new emerging technologies in other fields, 
mainly in the world of information and communication technologies (ICT). The latest trends influencing automation 
technology are IoT and CPS (Wollschlaeger et al. 2017). As a simple definition, IoT is considered as a computer link 
between physical objects within a system composed of several objects, while the CPS concept therefore expresses a 
physical coupling between objects (Valette et al. 2020). The CPS concept is often associated with the IOT concept. 
IOT is a system, computer and digital, of related sensors distributed around the world on the Internet that can 
communicate with each other to share and transfer information using a unique identifier that is assigned to each device, 
as a UID (Unique Identifier). A mobile friendly web application connected to the Cloud IOT server is used here for 
real-time monitoring and control (Gupta and Johari, 2019). It is through these concepts that predictive maintenance 
was born, with the objective of monitoring the condition of a machine and applying predictive modeling techniques 
to predict the probability of machine failure and give a time estimate of its likely occurrence. Predictive maintenance 
in the age of the Internet of Things (IoT) can be summarized as a maintenance methodology that brings together the 
power of machine learning and sensor data streaming to maintain machines before they fail, optimize resources, and 
thus reduce unplanned downtime (Shetty 2018). Industry 4.0 becomes the goal of all industries that are increasingly

Figure 2. Critical barrieres of company 
According to the 20/80 law, where 80% of the effects are produced by 20% of the causes, it turns out that the challenge 
of making decisions through analytical data, the inability to perceive short-term benefits hence the long process of 
return on investment as well as the lack of employee skills currently form a barrier for the digital transformation of 
companies. This is a challenge faced by SMEs in particular. The ideas and applicability of Industry 4.0 for SMEs are 
partially feasible. SMEs run higher risks of not being repaid for their investments in digitalization in the short term 
(Matt et al. 2020).  
They do not have a complete assessment of the current state with regard to their economy and technology, which 
creates another challenge that lies in the ignorance of the economic and technological benefits of digitization, giving 
the idea of starting over’ (Jantunen et al. 2018). 
5. Conclusion
Through research studies and literature review established in the context of Industry 4.0 application in SMEs, many 
SMEs are ready to make the digital transformation to an SME 4.0, but they are facing several barriers and obstacles 
that mainly come back to the lack of employee skills, high costs of implementing the new technologies and long 
payback process. This is usually due to the fact that SMEs have several production lines for different products and 
with different machines, the idea of implementing these new technologies in all operations is heavy for entrepreneurs 
because of the significant investment that it requires. In future studies, it will be necessary to think about applying the 
Lean manufacturing approach on a production line, by drawing the most critical operation which represents a 
bottleneck post for example, and whose productivity is reduced because of its high cycle time or that its availability 
is not in the objective because of the frequent stops, the goal is to introduce the new technologies only on this operation 
in a first time in order to visualize the benefits in term of productivity In predictive maintenance and decision support, 
rely on external expertise for a determined period of time to increase the competence of the employees, so that the 
entrepreneur will not have to make a large investment at the beginning, and will be able to introduce the culture of the 
new technologies gradually and will help in a safe and progressive increase in competence.

Abstract 
What are Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies? Can they be used in the banking sector? Is South Africa using them? 
These are various questions this paper attempts to answer. This paper looks for an in-depth overview of blockchain 
and cryptocurrency applications over the years, their current trends and challenges, innovations, and how the 
technology brings value to the finance industry. The paper fills a gap in South Africa by providing more insights into 
blockchain applications. This paper used research tools to understand the topic better to obtain relevant literature 
reviews from articles, reviews, conference papers, and journals. One hundred forty-two sources were reviewed, and 
only 24 were retained and identified as suitable to aid the completion of this paper. These sources varied from 2018 
to 2022 and included book chapters, conference papers, reviews, journals and articles. Results revealed that 
Blockchain is a way of managing a dataset distributed across a global network of computers with no single point of 
control. It creates blocks of all records kept as chains on a distributed network. Each block corresponds to coins that 
people hold (Cryptocurrency). As much as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are technologies that have been used in 
other countries, South Africa still has a long way to go to fully adopt them. Factors such as education on these 
technologies and infrastructure readiness are still significant challenges in the country; nevertheless, there is still hope 
for the country to use those technologies as humans are dynamic continuously.

1. Introduction
Blockchain innovation could lead to businesses expecting a shift in how payments are conducted. As articulated by 
one reviewer, ""The blockchain is essentially an online database that lists every account payable situation and the 
ability to record it permanently on a distributed public ledger"" (Babajide et al. 2020). Deloitte suggests that by the 
year 2025, 10% of the GDP will be recorded on blockchain technologies (World Economic Forum, 2015). Throughout 
the technology, blockchain is considered the basis of a digital ledger of financial transactions. All transactions are 
publicly added to the blockchain's universal catalogue, and verified by network nodes, and every entity in the network 
is called a user node (Babajide et al. 2020). This is a lightweight network of computers with a complete copy of the 
blockchain's ledger of transactions (Hassani, 2018). One of Satoshi Nakomoto's arguments was this piece that was 
about digital currency and operational efficiency. He believed all this could be achieved with a network connection as 
one where computers communicate and share information and data (Vivekanadam, 2020). He intended to eliminate 
centralized parties during a transaction, which was done by sharing information with all of the networks. A blockchain-
based digital currency also drives out costs in the system and allows parties to optimize overall user utility 
(Vivekanadam, 2020). Accordingly, a meeting in the U.S. in 2015 called 'Blockchain 2015' in Miami. Some call this 
'Bitcoin White Money' broken into three phases: Blockchain phase-one, blockchain phase-two, and blockchain phase-
three (Adhami et al., 2018). Phase one was labelled as 'Bitcoin-focused encryption digital funds as a starting point. 
Phase two was marked as 'smart management of contracts, often referred to as smart contracts. Finally, Phase three 
was labelled as an 'innovation process focused on the application of blockchain method. 
The use of blockchain technology is rapidly growing in banking operations across the world. With the help of 
Cryptocurrency, the traditional banking system is dramatically changing, and these institutions no longer need a bank 
to act as a middleman. Cryptocurrency is used as digital money to buy or sell goods or perform other economic 
activities (Bergetal., 2019). Cryptocurrency offers many benefits. For example, it can be a reliable P2P payment

al. (2020), users accept digital currencies for monetary transactions. Customers sometimes distrust the digital fund's 
marketplace, and volatility is a significant issue (Toufaily, 2021). Since 2021, banks have increased security systems 
to protect customers' data and money from identity theft and hacking (Toufaily, 2021). Transacting online requires 
new tasks as security analysts, bankers, and web developers all play roles in protecting users on the digital platform 
(Toufaily, 2021). Infrastructural problems in e-commerce result from anonymous online transactions. Banks balance 
efficiency and confidentiality when meeting their obligations. Government control is crucial to enable justice and 
compliant firms and users for cryptocurrency exchange (Toufaily, 2021). 
5. Conclusions
Blockchain technology is a secured distributed network of nodes on a network of computers. It's a type of ledger 
technology. The technology allows two people to directly record and exchange cryptographically linked financial 
assets. Since its inception in 2008, the price of the technology has skyrocketed, partly due to its volatility and 
increasing use. Although the application has gotten much attention, in South Africa, Bitcoin is the most well-known 
component of a blockchain. The technology has grown enough to spawn tokens and continues making strides in the 
future of technology. As Cryptocurrency is used, the blockchain network allows users to transact financial activities 
and transfer funds. However, it can be dangerous to institutions and clients due to risks such as money laundering and 
theft. Regulating and policy can penalize such criminal activity, offering more safety for users. As much as blockchain 
and cryptocurrencies are technologies that have been used in other countries, South Africa still has a long way to go 
to fully adopt them. Factors such as education on these technologies and infrastructure readiness are still significant 
challenges in the country; nevertheless, there is still hope for the country to use those technologies as humans are 
dynamic continuously.

Abstract 
The paper intended to offer insights on using Cryptocurrency as a Component of Blockchain technology in financial 
institutions with a focus on South Africa. The study sought:  (1) To highlight the economic impact that blockchain 
and Cryptocurrency have on the finance industry; (2) To learn more about how respondents; perspectives and 
experiences of blockchain and Cryptocurrency; and finally, (3) To determine what factors are helpful and harmful in 
the actual context of what would be deemed as a banking environment customers use a new group of e-commerce 
methods to conduct transactions without involving banks. A questionnaire was used to collect data, followed by 
interviews on respondents' different views related to blockchain and Cryptocurrency. From the large number of 
respondents that use financial institutions' services as a target, a sample of 200 participants took place in the study. 
The study's descriptive measures include variables such as the Mean, standard deviation, and correlation analysis. The 
SPSS software summarized and analyzed the relevant data collected. Correlation analysis measured the inner 
relationship between factors and the study data. The study showed that Millennials and Generation Z are much more 
technology inclined. Most of them were educated and showed interest in blockchain technology and the use of 
Cryptocurrency. The results also revealed a strong relationship between the possibilities and risks associated with 
blockchain and Cryptocurrency. Blockchain has become a more efficient way to complete transactions. The study 
showed that respondents utilize Cryptocurrency and perform different transactions such as cash receipts, deposit 
corrections, and cross-border payments.

1. Introduction
After the banking phone market innovation, businesses expect a shift in customer service delivery. For various reasons, 
more companies are adopting digital service platforms to address the need for speed and reliability (Babajide et al. 
2020). Deloitte predicts by the year 2025, 10% of GDP will be recorded with blockchain technologies (World 
Economic Forum, 2015). Blockchain technology can be applied to banking, which makes it a viable option for online 
transactions (Vivekanadam, 2020). Cryptocurrency components are blockchain components made from the 
cryptographic technique (Machkour and Abriane, 2020). Applied to the liquidity of the economy, cryptocurrencies 
use cryptography in circulation (Machkour and Abriane, 2020). With no third parties required, customers benefit the 
banking sector significantly. The near limitless and timely nature of blockchain serves very well in online marketing 
by reducing friction, costs and time of every transaction (Vivekanadam, 2020). However, the construction of this 
innovation has introduced substantial risks regarding the protection of customers and the banking industry (Manocha, 
2017). The regulation must address blockchain and Cryptocurrency's genuine threats and dangers (Manocha, 2017). 
While there are many opportunities and benefits of conducting online payment or transaction services, there are also 
risks and threats posed to individuals who bypass banks using digital means. Retailers, for instance, might be unaware 
that they are operating unregulated and uninsurable e-commerce outlets. As such, customers might be unaware of the 
risks and challenges associated with online cryptocurrency activity and lack the skills to navigate secure online 
transactions.

In total, there was a high number of alpha scores. This means that the respondents understood the questions of the 
questionnaire and the content, and was positive for the reliability of the study. 
4.7.2. Validity analysis 
A factor analysis was conducted to confirm that the subject was valid and significant. KMO and Bartlett statistical 
tests were performed to verify how the factors explain between variables (Table 9).

As shown in Table 10, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy conducted was 0.807. This indicates 
that the findings so long as adequate to perform the factor analysis led using Cryptocurrency as they have a higher 
value of 0.807. The overall research analysis showed an acceptable factor and measured the validity of the whole 
study. 
5. Conclusion
The study offered perspectives on Cryptocurrency in South Africa. This was done by highlighting the economic impact 
that blockchain and Cryptocurrency have on the finance industry. The study showed that Millennials and Generation 
Z are much more technology inclined. Most of them were educated and showed interest in blockchain technology and 
the use of Cryptocurrency. The study objective was met as the questionnaire suggests regulating blockchain and 
cryptocurrencies would be possible. The study also showed a strong relationship between the possibilities and risks 
associated with blockchain and Cryptocurrency. The use of interviews also showed respondents' views concerning the 
use of blockchain and Cryptocurrency. Blockchain has become a more efficient way to complete transactions. The 
study showed that respondents utilize Cryptocurrency and perform different transactions such as cash receipts, deposit 
corrections, and cross-border payments. Transactions are decentralized and faster, resulting in lower settlement times.

Abstract 
This study aims to examine if the approach of TQM is still helpful for enhancing both customer satisfaction and 
business performance. The following were listed objectives of this study: (1) To review the current state of affairs on 
TQM use in South African industries; (2) To identify the TQM benefits in South African industries and finally; (3) 
To barriers to TQM's implementation in South African industries. The study followed a review approach; It gathered 
the predetermined articles, journals, and textbooks, did a brief review, selected the papers to proceed with an in-depth 
study, and classified them into four groups. The study reviewed 48 papers, from 2013 to 2021. The results revealed 
that Total Quality Management Systems (QMS) are an essential issue to South African Industries. Reviewing the 
literature on Total Quality Management (TQM) and organizational performance is the goal of this study. South African 
organizations must be able to meet client demands and expectations in today's competitive market and complex 
business environment, including excellent product quality, quick delivery, and affordable pricing. Total Quality 
Management (TQM) is regarded as one of the most well-liked concepts for thoroughly managing the quality of goods 
and services. This study also examines if the approach of TQM is still helpful for enhancing both customer satisfaction 
and business performance. It thoroughly evaluates the literature systematically gathered from various industry areas. 
The findings demonstrate that many organizations still adopt this idea today, and by so doing, this helps organizations 
become more competitive, develop their businesses, be more sustainable, and boost employee morale.

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem statement
Nowadays, most businesses use quality management systems (QMS). All firms must now establish a quality
management system (QMS), especially in the current context of intense competition. In the context of South Africa,
organizations received QMS certificates in 2012. From 2012 to 2018, the number of QMS certificates for South Africa
increased at a pace of about 20.3% each year. (Patil, 2012). South Africa is ranked seventh in Africa, behind Morocco,
Nigeria, Namibia, Zambia, Rwanda, and Mauritius.
This data demonstrates the widespread adoption of the Total Quality Management standard in South Africa. (Taiye, 
2015) Unfortunately, some businesses in South Africa cannot keep up with their QMS. According to statistics, 2,461 
certifications were revoked between 2015 and 2016. The idea of quality has gained a widespread reputation as a 
healing tool for many organizational faults. This is due to the deep awareness that excellent quality is somehow 
connected to the good performance of the employees and the organization. In his study, Cvetkovik (2014) defined 
quality as the degree to which customers are satisfied with a particular good or service. In a different sense, the author 
derived the term ""quality"" from the customer's perspective, which is essentially what any firm aspires to. Another 
study by (Doluschitz, 2013) and colleagues defined quality as the capacity of a given good or service to meet implicit 
or explicit standards and satisfy customers; in this case, quality must be tested and assessed before it is delivered to 
the client. (Thomas, 2015) offered a different definition of quality, stating that it is the degree to which the product or 
service complies with the previously established standards. In the competitive and dynamic corporate environment, 
as well as in the dynamic market condition, globalization, rapid technical advancements, competition, disruptive

5. Conclusion and future research
Total Quality Management (TQM) is still widely practised in numerous businesses and nations worldwide. TQM is 
focused on increasing customer satisfaction by improving the quality of products, services, and overall quality of the 
organization to deliver the best product or service solution to the customer. This is one of the main reasons why TQM 
is still appropriate in this modern environment. Another reason is that TQM is implemented with complete 
commitment from management and total employee involvement. It becomes a strong concept that is straightforward 
to comprehend and simple to implement. Furthermore, as TQM adoption in the organization must be quantified to 
continuously improve and stay competitive in today's business environment, the standard measurement method is 
required to identify the level or score of TQM implementation. Additionally, it is strongly advised to conduct research 
on various industry sectors, especially for new start-ups like e-commerce or digital start-ups, to ensure that TQM is 
still appropriate for such sectors.

Abstract 
This research determines and mitigates project management delays during turbine maintenance outages. Such 
mitigations would benefit the organisation in improving plant availability and increasing electricity availability to the 
consumers through load shedding reduction. The research was triggered by turbine maintenance outages which 
override the targeted contractual date due to deficiencies in the implementation of project management philosophies 
and controls. The scope of this research begins at the outage planning phase and ends when the machine returns to 
service. This study formulates a list of project management delays and mitigation strategies for the said delays to 
achieve project objectives. It further arrives at conclusions that are directed at the power generation industry and 
maintenance industries in general.

1. Introduction
The South African power generation industry has been faced with unreliable power production efficiencies which limit 
the availability of constant electrical energy to the South African grid for the past decade (Goldberg 2015). The 
instability of electrical power availability not only affects the consumers but also weakens the country’s economy with 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) statistics as a result of high prices, low market product exchange and investments 
(Gonese et al. 2019). Electricity generation and supply shortages result in the country’s national control implementing 
planned rolling blackouts, referred to as rotational load shedding (Goldberg 2015). Various factors that are a threat to 
the national grid integrity are said to be: delayed planned and unplanned outages; high planned and unplanned capacity 
load factors (including distribution and transmission); high daily load losses; deficiencies in maintenance and lack of 
effective management and leadership performance (Holtzhausen 2012). In addition to the threats mentioned, one of the 
highlighted impacts of the shortage of electricity and increase in cost is turbine outages that take longer than planned to 
come online (Eskom 2017).  
Power generation turbine maintenance philosophies operate in such a way that machines are shut down at certain 
manufacturer-recommended intervals to allow machine inspection and where necessary refurbishment to be done. The 
primary purpose of planned maintenance practice is to maximize reliability by restoring a plant or equipment to optimal 
condition and minimizing operating costs (Rezaei 2017). Tabucanon and Dahanayaka (1989) also maintain that planned 
shutdowns are aimed to increase equipment performance which results in lower operating costs. 
It is the responsibility of the project manager to oversee the project from initiation until closure, and his main 
accountability is to manage the triple constraints (Abu-hussein et al. 2016). These constraints are to deliver a project on 
time, within budget and to the desired scope, not ignoring the safety aspects (Sommerville et al. 2013). Mtembi and 
Kanakana (2016) state that project management activities during the project cycle are the project managers’ 
responsibility but are not limited to planning, organising, controlling, directing, forecasting, developing staff, 
motivating, communicating and coordinating. This paper examines and presents project management delays in planned 
turbine maintenance outages. These delays are then subjected to mitigation strategies to eliminate the delays.

6. Conclusion 
This research aimed to determine and mitigate project management-related delays to planned power generation turbine 
maintenance outages. Based on a qualitative analysis of literature and through interviews during the study, it can be 
concluded that there is a wide spread of project management delays that affects the project due dates in power generation 
turbine maintenance outages. Such delays negatively impact on electrical power availability to the national grid. 
Mitigation strategies formulated through this research have to be followed to reduce the unreliability of power supply 
due to planned turbine maintenance outages that override the targeted contractual dates.

Abstract 
The current research work provides an investigation into the connection between the design parameters of an earphone 
and the sound quality performance in order to generate recommendations for future designs. As the earphone design 
was highly dependent on the empirical experience of the engineers, along with extensive trial and error, it was found 
to be difficult for research and development. Therefore, the current study sought a systematic approach to deal with 
the design. Along with the simplification of the earphone design problem, the sound quality performance outcomes 
were characterized by six factors, including total harmonic distortion, output power, frequency response, signal-to-
noise ratio, speaker impedance, and headroom with seven levels with eight design parameters for the selection of types 
of divers (dynamic driver/moving coil, balanced armature driver, and planar magnetic driver), magnet (N35, N40, 
N45, and N50 Grade Neodymium Magnet), voice coils (copper wire, copper-covered aluminium wire, and silver wire), 
and diaphragm (polyethene terephthalate, polyethene naphtholate, polyetheretherketone, and polyetheretherketone + 
polyurethane) for the two drivers with zeros for the earphone products with a single driver. After the consolidation of 
the data from the manufacturer, regression analysis was conducted, while the six equations were formulated, and the 
models highlighted the importance of the selection of the type of primary driver and the irrelevance of the type of 
secondary driver. The result not only provides a direct and evidence recommendation for the research and development 
of earphones, but the research work also proposes an innovative way for knowledge generation from the information 
as well as existing data.

1. Introduction
The current study provides an evaluation of the design practice of an earphone so that the recommendations for future 
designs can be backed by the completed project. For the sake of having a systematic illustration of the contents, the 
motivation for the study of the design parameters and the linkage with the sound quality outcomes would be 
highlighted in order to justify the urgency and needs of the study. Earphone design was found to be complicated and 
highly dependent on the experience of the developers, while it limited the transfer of knowledge and organizational 
growth (Patel, Cheer, & Fontana, 2020). Therefore, it would be advisable to gain the know-how from the previously 
conducted projects in order to provide directed suggestions for future development. In the current work, the related 
research gap would be catered to in order to benefit the design process of earphones. Essentially, the current project 
can be considered a consolidation of the design knowledge and a typical example of the utilization of the previously 
collected data for computer-aided design (Klich, 2017). Practically, the major innovation of the research study was 
the simplification and the design practices and the employment of statistical tools in generating recommendations and 
knowledge to guide future research and development (Xiao & Chan, 2017).  
With respect to the mentioned motivation, the aim of the current research study was defined to reveal the connection 
between the design parameters of an earphone and the resulting sound performance quality in order to generate the 
practice implication for future design. Therefore., with the intention of accomplishing the defined aim, the four 
objectives of the work were formulated. 
1.
To simplify the design problem of earphone design so that the development can be characterized with
parameters

3. The linear models were formulated with regression analysis in order to characterize the connection between 
the design variables and the sound quality outcomes in order to gain insight from the conducted projects. 
4. The recommendations were given based on the gained knowledge in order to support the wise design. 
 
To conclude, with reference to the formulated set of equations, three observable conclusive remarks can be drawn. On 
the one hand, from the loadings corresponding to the type of driver 1, it can be seen that the selection of the type of 
the primary driver has a significant impact on the total harmonic distortion, output power, frequency response, signal 
to noise ratio, and speaker impedance, while the result suggested the planar magnetic driver as a supported solution 
for the earphone product. Second, from the last row of the equation, the result suggested the headroom was highly 
contributed by the selection of the voice coils of the secondary driver, while the silver wire was recommended. Lastly, 
with respect to the equation, the irrelevance of the selection of the secondary driver can be evidenced, while the future 
design should adopt a cheap solution for driver 2 for the wise allocation of resources. All in all, along with the 
inspection of the equation, it can be seen that know-how can be generated from the conducted projects, while the 
related findings helped the company to consolidate the design principles of the product design. Furthermore, three 
directions for future development can be highlighted. 
 
1. Instead of a linear regression model, the nonlinearity of the formulation can be catered to with the adoption 
of machine learning techniques (Mullainathan & Spiess, 2017) so that the association between the design 
parameters and the sound quality factors can be characterized. 
2. Apart from the proposed selection of the design parameters, more selections can be included in order to enrich 
the diversity of the design for enhanced representation of the design problem. 
3. Similarly, apart from the design parameters, enrichment can be conducted among the sound performance 
indicators in order to widen the spectrum of the sound quality selection.

Abstract 
Simulation and modeling is the process that aids in mimicking the behavior of a real system for the purpose of 
conducting a study in order to understand operational processes and optimize the outcomes thereof by directly 
implementing the positive findings from the model in real life situations. The application of simulation and modeling 
using Arena simulation software has seen successful implementation based on its outcomes in many cases such as 
manufacturing process lines optimizations and in overall, improvement of supply chains in both manufacturing and 
service sectors. This study aimed at improvement of dispatch work process line by making use of Arena simulation 
modeling as tools for identifying areas of improvement of in a coal fly ash processing plant of a manufacturer situated 
in Sasolburg, South Africa. The manufacturer struggled with daily truck dispatches, Arena simulation modeling 
software has revealed that key process waste was on amount of time spent on each dispatch work process lines. With 
the current dispatch process layout, 22 number of trucks are dispatched within an 8 hour shift, time improvement 
estimations on dispatch work process stages improved the number of trucks dispatched to 30 which was 36% 
improvement, meanwhile simulation of proposed new dispatch work process layout coupled with work process stages 
time interval estimate reduction showed an improvement of number of trucks from 22 to 40 which was 45%. It was 
recommended to the manufacturer to focus on either improving the time requirement within the work process stages 
using the current layout or opt for completely altering the layout and increase the length of the one out of three 
available dispatch weighbridge which was 16 meters, thus to 24 meters in order to accommodate all types of trucks, 
particularly trucks with tankers and pub in order to improve daily number of truck dispatches which is directly linked 
to sales.

1. Introduction
The South Africa construction industry is one of the sectors that plays a vital role in the country’s economy and 
contributes positively to the economic growth. This is achieved through building and other civil engineering structures 
with considerable amounts of expenditures. The industry is facing challenges such as public sector capacity, 
procurement practices and capacity for sustainable empowerment, infrastructure availability and increase in cost of 
building materials which makes the government spent to be low thus affecting the performance of this industry 
(Windapo and Cattell 2013).  
Productivity improvement through the application of lean manufacturing tools and simulation modeling has been 
applied in many service and manufacturing facilities and have seen a successful outcomes. Majority of companies 
chose to adopt lean manufacturing for four primary reasons, viz: reduction of manufacturing resource requirements, 
increment of level of customer satisfaction, reduction in cycle time of manufacturing and ultimately for the increase 
in profitability of the industry. Thus manufacturing industries that are traditionally operated tends to face a lot of 
challenges such as manufacturing cost, lead times of manufacturing that are longer, compromised product quality and 
negatively affected customer satisfaction (Manikandaprabu and Anbuudayasankar 2019).

at the entrance.  This holds a fact as many times, the truck stands at the security entrance having challenges with order 
number not appearing on the system, also drivers not having the correct PPE and truck sometimes was not road worthy 
and the average number waiting to enter the plant is 25.479 approximately 25 trucks. These cascaded to the dispatch 
of 22 trucks than the full potential of product demand, which was a lost opportunity due to time. Simulation and 
modeling on the optimized dispatch work process time intervals across each stage yielded a system efficiency of 30%, 
which was an increase in 5%. The total number of trucks waiting at the security entrance was reduced to 116.65 
minutes. The optimized  system also further indicated a reduction in the average waiting time of que from 53.430 
minutes to 14.002 minutes for loading of trucks with tankers only, meanwhile the trucks that had tankers and pub, 
took longer in the improved time intervals , where the waiting time increased from a total of 14.903 minutes to 39.083. 
The total number of trucks dispatch in the time interval improved system increased from 22 trucks as from the initial 
system to 30, thus an increase with 8 trucks which was an additional sale in an 8 hours ran. The instantaneous 
utilization of the resources indicated how busy the resources were within the simulation period, the results showed 
that the security officer and dispatch officer remained fairly busy across the two scenarios being modeled. However, 
with high number of trucks waiting on que to access the plant, it was noted that the dispatch officer was busy than 
they should have been busier. The 22 total number of trucks dispatched in both the current dispatch work process and 
30 total number of trucks dispatched in the improved time interval on each stage process, showed a direct similarity 
with the 8 and 27 total number of trucks that can be dispatched as calculated in section 4.1.1 for the overall verification 
and validation of modeling results for when the plant is underperforming and when it is improved with stock 
availability as is the similar expression in this simulation scenarios. These indicated a clear reliability of the simulation 
and modeling data obtained. 
 
In the case of improved dispatch work process layout and time intervals on process stages, the number of trucks 
dispatched increased from 30 to 40, also the system efficiency increased from 30% to 45%. It was also important to 
note that the improved dispatch work process layout and time intervals on process stages admitted a total of 89 trucks 
where 40 of the trucks were dispatched in an the 480 minutes replication length ran. These indicated good system 
efficiency increased and the resources remained fairly utilized. This optimized  system holds to be true to be 
implemented by the manufacturer based on the fact that there is time loss due to availability of only one loading bay 
that can accommodate trucks with tankers and pub, thus resulting with reduction with total of trucks. This improved 
layout catered for all truck types. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The following recommendations were made to the manufacturer in order to improve the total number of trucks 
dispatched per day: 
• 
Improve the time intervals within the dispatch work process stages  
• 
Ensure that the order numbers given to transporters are pre-checked that they are valid in order to avoid 
delays on product dispatches 
• 
Invest in work process layout coupled with increasing the length of the available weighbridge in order to 
accommodate all types of trucks, particularly trucks with tankers and pubs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the outcome of the simulation and modeling, it was evident that there was a time wastage on various process 
stages within the dispatch work process lines which needed to be optimized. The improvement in the time on each 
process line directly improved the total number of trucks that can be dispatched per day in an 8 hour shift, with number 
of trucks improving from 22 to 30, that was, 36% improvement, meanwhile in the case proposed new dispatch work 
process layout added with improved time within work process stages, improved the number of trucks dispatched in an 
8 hour shift, thus from 22 to 40 which was 45% improvement. These signified that the implementation of the process 
stages time intervals improvement and improvement of dispatch work process layout combined process stages time 
intervals improved the daily sales of the manufacturer as the number of trucks per day is directly proposal to sales. 
Simulation and modeling is the based tool for continuous improvement of work process within the management of 
operations.

Abstract 
Quality is an important aspect that all companies in world because it is the ability of satisfying the needs of the 
customers by providing items that meet their criteria. The management of quality is very important as it enable 
customer satisfaction at lower price and continuous quality improvement. Quality control is all about analyzing the 
project results to see if their meet the quality standards or not, finding the solution to eradicate the causes of the target 
standards’ failure. Quality assurance main aim is to do regular and continuous assessment of the general project to 
meet quality standards.The research study focused on empirical testing and practical applicability of theoretical 
concepts of quality management system in manufacturing industry in South Africa. The study was conducted in South 
Africa and in Johannesburg specifically. This study covered only quality management in the manufacturing industry 
(manufacturing plant) and the warehouses as well as employees and their roles in the implementation of QMS.A 
quantitative method was used to conduct this study. The quantitative method was used for collecting and analyzing 
data. This means that the researcher used a well-structured questionnaire to collect data. Findings revealed that focus 
on client’s satisfaction, focus on customer needs, involvement in the QMS application process, work as a team, attend 
training sessions, contribute to improvements, encourage and motivate other employees are the major roles of 
employee and management in the application of QMS in South African manufacturing organizations.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing sector is very essential to the economic health. This is because it promotes employment of a lot 
people of various skills, which contribute largely to the worldwide economy (Naude and Szirmai, 2012) .The main 
purpose of manufacturing companies is to satisfy customers. This is because customers will enable the company to 
remain into business as well as increase the company profit by reacting positively to fabricated products. Quality is 
an important aspect that all companies in world because it is the ability of satisfying the needs of the customers by 
providing items that meet their criteria. The management of quality is very important as its enables customer 
satisfaction at lower price and continuous quality improvement (Willard, 2014). Kapoor (2007) explained that the 
adoption of quality management in all companies including the manufacturing sector guarantee a better business 
advancement by providing good quality items at a constant and affordable price. According to Mane and Patail (2015) 
the management of quality management is made up of three steps which are quality planning, quality control and 
quality assurance. Quality planning is the phase the definition of the company quality standards and provides the 
framework on how the standards will be achieved. Quality control is all about analyzing the project results to see if 
their meet the quality standards or not, finding the solution to eradicate the causes of the target standards’ failure. 
Quality assurance main aim is to do regular and continuous assessment of the general project to meet quality standards. 
Moodliyar (2008) infers that to better manage quality in organisations a quality management system (QMS) is 
required. QMS represents a system that helps in the documentation of procedures, processes and tasks needed to 
accomplish quality regulations and objectives for the success of manufacturing companies. According to Bengt (2010), 
the importance of a quality management system is a continuous improvement process that provides the right insights

5.3. Discussion of Findings 
The literature review identified fourteen roles of employee and management in the application of QMS. Among the 
identified roles, ‘focus on client’s satisfaction’ and focus on customer needs were respectively ranked as the top two 
roles. This implies that in business the customer is king and all personnel must put all their efforts to please him/ her. 
Once the customer is pleased the business continuity is reassured. No other reason should be at the centre of quality 
management application beside the requirements of the client. This is because if there are no clients in business and 
there will be no income and the company will be useless. This finding corroborates the study of (Knowles, 2011) who 
stated that every employee in the SAMI has the role to set his or her focus and energy on the client needs by applying 
quality management to endlessly satisfy the customer. The result for this objective also implies that all the listed roles 
are the associated roles of employees in the application of Quality Management System in South African 
manufacturing industry as the lowest role have a mean value of 3.981. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
The study seeks to determine the roles of employee and management in the application of QMS in South African 
manufacturing organizations. It was revealed from the result of the primary data that focus on client’s satisfaction, 
focus on customer needs, involvement in the QMS application process, work as a team, attend training sessions, 
contribute to improvements, encourage and motivate other employees, share knowledge and skills, motivate 
colleagues in sharing ideas take into consideration the shared ideas, accept change of cultures and systems, share their 
knowledge, accept new ideas from colleagues, take ownership of the company success are the roles of the roles of 
employee and management in the application of QMS in South African manufacturing organizations the in order of 
priority. These findings support the general saying that clients or customers are the king of business. Without the 
consideration of customers, the business is subjected to fail. Although the South African manufacturing industry is 
making every effort to increase the applicability of QMS to enhance the continuous improvement of quality 
performance. It is important to point out a course of action to assist them in understanding how to channel their efforts 
in the right direction. Based on this submission, it is recommended that as it has been established that focusing on 
client need determines the continuity of the manufacturing industry, the managers and the supervisors should set a 
strict rule to place the requirements of the client at the centre of quality management application. Based on the 
limitation of this study to only Gauteng province of South Africa, future research that uses a larger sample size and 
broader the research location needs. In addition, other industries can be studied to ascertain if these results are 
applicable.

The role that technology business incubators (TBIs) play in the development of new ventures is of utmost importance 
for innovative enterprises especially in preparing them to adapt during times of fast-changing business environments. 
Establishing the effects that incubation services have on these innovative ventures particularly small to medium 
enterprises (SMEs) can assist in understanding how they develop capabilities that can enable surviving in the market 
once they have graduated. The survival capabilities utilised by SMEs in changing business environments can be 
referred to as dynamic capabilities. This paper explored the dynamic capability developed by SMEs from product 
development services offered by TBIs. A qualitative research method approach was utilised where 16 technology 
business incubation managers were assessed to determine their perceptions of a dynamic capability developed from 
product development services. The results of the study reveal that Technology Management is a dynamic capability 
developed from Product Development services during the business incubation process. This study contributes to better 
understanding of the dynamic capabilities view (DCV) theory when looking at incubation services and their impact 
on innovative SMEs, particularly product development services. It practically explains the relationship between 
Product Development and Technology Management. This is important for incubation practitioners to understand when 
providing their services to SMEs. It is equally relevant for entrepreneurs in preparation for the inevitable change in 
business environment as it provides a perspective on how to adapt to this change by building technology management 
capacity from the product development services received during incubation. The study adopted a unique approach of 
combining two critical enterprise development instruments which are business incubators and technology stations 
into one component. These two entities were viewed with one lens and adopted an umbrella term that called these two 
entities combined as Technology Business Incubators.

1. Introduction
The concept of the dynamic capabilities view (DCV) was originally defined by (Teece et al., 1997) as “The ﬁrm’s 
ability to integrate, build, and reconﬁgure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing 
environments”. This has proven to be a very important concept for the field of strategic management theory since it 
talks directly to how firms survive and create competitive advantage in times of business environmental change, which 
is almost always inevitable in some point of a business cycle (Fatoki, 2021). Business incubation on the other hand is 
a concept which is mainly about provision of a variety of business development services to early-stage ventures that 
will allow them to graduate from the process and be able to survive in the real business environment Shih and Aaboen 
(2019).  This study explored the role that product development services play in creating a dynamic capability for 
incubated SMEs.  This was done in order to understand what is the capability that the enterprises get to build during 
their incubation period.  A focus was made in particular to product development services within incubation. The type 
of incubators that can provide product development fall within the category of technology business incubators (TBIs) 
which are more focused on entities concerned with technology-based business and can be located within a variety 
facilities such as research parks, technology centres, business incubators and accelerators (Mian et al., 2016). For this 
particular study, TBI mechanisms examined entailed a combination of classical business incubators and the unique

The categories from the sections above were then combined to consolidate into the Theme in the form of Technology 
Management.  This theme has been well examined initially by Cetindamar, Phaal and Probert (2009) as a dynamic 
capability in their seminal paper, emphasizing the development and exploitation of technological capabilities that are 
changing on a constant basis. This is also reflected in a model that that provides a better understanding of technology 
management by drawing boundaries and relationships between the concept and other management disciplines 
particularly with innovation. In the responses received from the respondents above, there seems to be a pattern in an 
integration of other management practices such as manufacturing and continuous improvement. This integration 
approach is consistent with the argument made by Krawczyk-Dembicka (2017) who look at technology management 
as involving the steps of identification, selection and acquisition. Finally the study reflects that it is possible for the 
managers of incubated innovative SMES to transform their resource base in the enterprise to develop dynamic 
capabilties as consistent with (Ambrosini and Altintas, 2019). 
 
6. Conclusion  
Given that Technology Management is the dynamic capability identified as being developed from product 
management services of business incubation. The Technology Management capability reflected from the respondents 
above gives an indication that products can be modified by the incubated SMEs based on adjusting their manufacturing 
process to adapt to changing business environment when they arise. This can be attributed to assistance received in 
the form of RandD and operations management which leads to better management of the technology by the incubated 
SMEs who have acquired product development services from technology business incubators and Technology Stations 
in particular (or from the global phenomenon, TBI). Central to the DCV perspective is the aspect of resource 
reconfiguration (Cyfert et al., 2021). From a reconfiguration perspective, in this study this aspect has been displayed, 
for instance the resources identified were products and technology as enabled by manufacturing and continuous 
improvement capabilities of the SMEs in the dynamic capabilities’ development process. 
 
The main question that the study asked was: What is the dynamic capability developed from product management 
services of technology business incubation? The results found that Technology Management is a dynamic capability 
developed from Product Development services during the business incubation process.  
 
This is important for the incubation process in three levels. Firstly, at a services level. Secondly at a dynamic 
capabilities level. Thirdly at a managerial level for SMEs in terms of how they make their decisions in assisting their 
enterprises thrive during business environmental changes which is at the essence of DCV.

Abstract 
Energy demand is a global crisis. Since the year 2010, most buildings’ energy consumption across the globe has 
increased by almost 14% (Paris Agreement, 2018). As a result, energy-supplying utilities have had to increase the 
burning of coal and gas to meet the demand, which results in high carbon emissions causing global warming 
(EcoMetrix Africa, 2021). This study evaluates the impact of implementing smart technologies in high-density 
residential zones by utilising a system that is energy-efficient and cost-saving. The study compared the energy 
consumption of two mixed student residences of the University of Johannesburg, where one is equipped with smart 
technologies while the other functions with a traditional energy supply system. The results obtained show that there 
is a 46.26% variance between the two residences' energy consumption. This study's results show that the 
implementation of smart technologies in high-density residential units can reduce energy consumption by 
approximately 46% compared to a traditional way of energy supply. The results also reveal that the implementation 
of smart technologies can reduce the contribution of carbon emissions by 33%.

1. Introduction
According to the Paris Agreement, carbon emissions should be reduced drastically to achieve the set target of net-zero 
carbon emissions by the year 2030 (Paris Agreement, 2018). There are many energy-efficient projects such as 
retrofitting, PV installations, smart technology installations and others of this nature that are being implemented to 
reduce energy consumption. These projects guarantee a net-zero carbon emission future (Laurina et al., 2018). Based 
on the power optimal 2018 report, it is highlighted that over the past decade, South Africa’s primary electricity supplier 
(Eskom) has escalated electricity prices drastically by 356%, at an inflation rate of 74% over a similar period. This 
shows that the price of electricity in the country has escalated four times faster than the inflation rate over the same 
period. Therefore, the implementation of energy-efficient projects would also play a role in reducing the steep increase 
in the electricity price.  
The electricity sector in South Africa is generated and powered by the national utility Eskom, which generates 
approximately 90% of the electricity used in the country. A total of 10% is supplied by municipalities and 
redistributors, which include independent power producers (IPPs) (Global Energy Demand, 2018). Eskom also 
supplies roughly 40% of electricity to other African countries (Matteo et al. 2019). The 2020 Eskom Energy 
Distribution Report indicates that Eskom is directly supplying power to 2 703 industrial, 51 848 commercial, 81 638 
agricultural and six million residential customers. Since March 2018, the Eskom net maximum generating capacity 
amounted to a total of 48 GW (Michael, 2020). The Eskom power station maximum generation matrix is presented in 
Figure 1. 
The South African electricity supply is dominated by coal-fired power stations that have supplied 83% of the baseload 
since 2018. The combined contribution of maximum generation capacity by other power stations constitutes 17%. The 
pumped scheme contributes 6%, gas turbines account for 5%, nuclear power stations 4%, and hydro-power stations 
contribute 2%. The South African primary energy supply includes indigenous products, and considering the

6. Conclusion 
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of implementing smart technologies in residential 
buildings. It was achieved by analysing and comparing the energy consumption of the University of Johannesburg’s 
Mayine and Thomas Sankara’s residences during the 2019 calendar year. The energy consumption and their respective 
energy costs data were analysed and compared graphically. The difference between the two energy consumption 
means values indicates that there is a 46.26% variance between the two residences' energy consumption. This means 
that the consumption at Mayine residence is almost double that of Thomas Sankara residence. The reason for this 
significant variance is because various energy-saving initiatives have been implemented at Thomas Sankara, such as 
occupancy, energy-saving lights, installation of high-efficient showerheads, installation of water heat pumps, as well 
as control ripple relays. The Mayine and Thomas Sankara residences contribute 234.36 tons 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 year and the 
157.11 tons  𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 year of carbon emission. These reveal that the implementation of smart technologies can reduce 
the carbon emissions of residential buildings by 33%. 
 
The analysed data showed that most energy consumption occurs during the winter season. The research findings also 
prove that there is higher consumption during the peak hours, from the morning at 6 am to 10 am and also in the 
evening from 5 pm till 10 pm. Furthermore, the electricity consumption rate during the winter season is more 
expensive as compared to all the other seasons. In addition, other significant energy consumption contributors that are 
not taken seriously at residences are the passage, bathroom and toilet lights which are always left on even when there 
is no activity taking place. These are the most crucial areas which need smart technology systems in the residences of 
institutions. 
 
For energy reduction at the residences, it is recommended that residence management implement an incentive strategy 
that will encourage an energy-saving culture in students, for example, hosting energy awareness per semester and 
during the event reward the residents who have used less energy for that semester. In addition, management can 
implement a programme where residents of university accommodation come up with innovative ideas for energy-
saving, such as designing motion sensor lighting systems and smart plug systems. These ideas can then be sponsored 
and implemented at the university residences as a means of energy efficiency. Furthermore, it is recommended that 
all the existing residential buildings are retrofitted. It can be done through the use of smart windows, smart roofing 
systems, smart plug systems and other innovations.

Abstract 
Water is a vital commodity for human life. To that end, a pipeline is a critical component to transport water from the 
source to end-users. The pipeline system is a highly complex network in and of itself. As a result, the dependability 
of such a component is critical in ensuring the stability and security of an uninterrupted water supply. The purpose of 
this research is to investigate the causes of premature failures in the South African water pipeline system. To 
accomplish this goal, this study examines the factors causing premature pipeline failures using existing literature and 
archival data. According to the findings, the major causes of premature water pipeline system damage include both 
internal and external corrosion, damage by others (vandalism, sabotage, and theft), miscellaneous, operator error, 
welding, mechanical damage, equipment, joint leaks, over-pressure and pig traps. It is expected that the findings of 
this study will help various stakeholders save billions of rand that are spent to replace damaged pipelines.

1. Introduction
Water is a crucial commodity for human life (Chaplin, 2001). The water pipeline is a key component that is used to 
transport water from the source to the end-users (Mcneiill & Edwards, 2001; Marais, et al., 2004). The pipeline system 
itself is a highly complex network. Therefore, the reliability of its components is critical in ensuring the stability and 
security of continuous water supply. Around the world, it becomes a great worry for water utilities when the water 
distribution system deteriorates (Nieuwoudt, et al., 2004). As a result of this deterioration process, pipelines eventually 
fail and cause the system to transport less water than it is meant to. Another worrying factor is that the water 
distribution system might get contaminated. With limited resources available to water utilities to repair the pipeline 
infrastructure, the importance of assessing the current and future state of the water pipeline systems should be 
emphasized. Currently, approximately 780 million people on the planet do not have access to clean drinking water. 
This equates to more than two and a half times the total population of the United States of America (Blignaut & Van 
Heerden, 2009). Every day up to 200 million hours are spent by communities across the entire world gathering water 
for household use (Deen, 2012). It has been established that every 20 seconds a youngster passes away due to an 
illness associated with water. Approximately 3.41 million individuals pass away every year as a result of water, 
sanitation and hygiene-related illnesses (Deen, 2012). It is essential to provide people with clean consumable water. 
Just like in the United States, there are places where some communities are in danger of getting water-borne illnesses 
as the water is used before it is thoroughly purified and therefore not suitable for human consumption (Colford, et al., 
2006). In most cases, unusual colour, flavour, and odour, bacterial pollution, loss of hydraulic volume and pressure, 
leaks, breakdowns, and street collapses are regarded as flaws in water distribution (Cosgrove & Loucks, 2015). 
Many areas in South Africa have been observed to be water-stressed in recent decades. This water crisis is largely the 
result of existing water pipeline systems, which in most cases fail before the end of their expected lifespan. To address 
this issue, the South African government must allocate additional funding to maintain existing infrastructure. 
However, given the current economic crisis, the government lacks sufficient financial resources. The research problem 
of this study was that South Africa is experiencing premature failure in its water pipeline systems, with little to no 
knowledge of the factors causing it.

5. Validation
According to Maree and Fraser (2004), a study is said to have longevity if the same methodological process was 
applied again under the same conditions and produced the same results. The ability of tools, processes and techniques 
to produce consistent results under specified conditions is referred to as reliability (Uma and Roger 2009). To ensure 
the study's reliability, the authors created a folder containing all communications, information and documentation 
related to it and detailed the study's step-by-step process for data collection and analysis. The authors employed two 
types of validation methods in this study: face validity and content validity. Drost (2011), characterizes face validity 
as a personal judgment on the operationalization of a concept. The author uses an example that one might look at a 
measure of reading ability, go through the content, and immediately make a judgment based on knowledge and 
expertise that the reading ability looks like a good measure, whereas to others the validation method may not be 
substantial. 
Content validity can be characterized as a qualitative technique of guaranteeing that the results achieved dwell on the 
importance of the concept applied as defined by Drost (2011). The author goes on to say that content validity can be 
assessed in two ways: firstly, by the number of questions regarding the test and secondly, by getting inputs from 
experts in the field. According to Rossiter (2011), among all types of validities, content validity is the most trustworthy 
technique for validating a measure. 
6. Conclusion
Around the world, it becomes a great worry for water utilities when the water pipeline distribution systems deteriorate 
and fail before they reach their expected lifespan. As a result of this deterioration process, pipelines eventually fail 
and therefore cause the system to transport less water than it was designed for. Another worrying factor is that the 
water distribution system might get contaminated. With limited resources available to water utilities for repairing the 
pipeline infrastructure, it outlines the importance of assessing the current and future state of the water pipeline systems. 
To this end, over the last decades, it has been observed that many areas in South Africa are facing a serious water 
crisis. This water crisis is largely attributed to the existing water pipeline systems, which in most cases are failing 
before they reach their expected lifespan. To resolve this problem, the South African government is required to allocate 
additional funding to sustain existing infrastructure. However, with the current economic crisis, the government does 
not have sufficient financial resources. Therefore, the research objective of this study was to explore the causes of 
premature failures of the current water pipeline systems. The findings revealed that the major causes damaging the 
water pipeline system prematurely include both internal and external corrosion, damage by others (vandalism, 
sabotage and theft), miscellaneous, operator error, weld, mechanical damage, equipment, joint leaks, over-pressure 
and pig traps. It is, therefore, believed that the outcome of this study would assist decision-makers in the South African 
water utility to save billions of rand that are often allocated to replace damaged pipelines.

Abstract 
Indonesia is the one country has sufficiently large and developed financial markets. With very large non-bankable 
segment in this country, one of the financial markets that plays intermediary function to the communities is the 
financing industry. However, the growth of this industry in disbursing financing to the public has actually been 
decadence over the last few years. In these conditions, several researchers state the important role of intrapreneurial 
orientation as a stimulus for industries that are experiencing stagnation in growth like this industry. Starting from 
this phenomenon, research will be conducted to examine and find out whether there are differences between 
managers across-companies with different rentability and/or company sizes. Two stage stratified random sampling 
technique will be used in obtaining data from respondents. Then quantitative research with SPSS will be carried out 
in three stages. First, the analysis will be carried out by testing the normality of the data. The normality test of the 
data will be carried out using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the data is normally distributed, then the second stage 
will be carried out with the Anova test. However, if the data is not normally distributed, the research will be 
conducted using the Kruskal Wallis test. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric statistical test that can be used 
to test whether there is a significant difference between the independent variable group and the dependent variable. 
In the third stage, descriptive analysis will be carried out to provide the potrait about the ingredient of intrapreneurial 
orientaton in manager level and inspiration to increasing it incrementally base on the results of the second stage of 
testing.

intrapreneurial orientation, company rentability and company size. 
1. Introduction
During of the decade, the growth of the financing industry in Indonesia can be said to be experiencing a slowdown. 
This condition occurs in terms of the growth of financing receivables and the growth of profitability. More detail, at 
the beginning of the decade account receivables in financing industry accelerate to grew by 23%. But at the end of 
the decade currently decline and slowdown to be grow 2% only. In these conditions, many researchers state about 
the lack of entrepreneurial orientation as one of the causes that must be corrected in order to become a solution and 
antidote for industries or companies that are experiencing slowing growth (Hitt, Ireland, & Hoskisson, 2001; Meyer, 
Neck, & Meeks, 2002; Kraus & Kauranen, 2009; Thornberry, 2001). 
To fostering intrapreneur orientation within the company, people within the company are the main protagonist 
(Morris et al., 2010 in Dhewanto, 2013). This is because these entrepreneurial values do not start at the institutional 
level, but start at the individual level (Dhewanto, 2013). Thus it can be said that to grow intrapreneur orientation, 
companies need to identify and develop employees who have intrapreneur potential as catalysts in the organization. 
However, companies also need to seek and facilitate so that the individuals within them can be intrinsically 
motivated to act as catalysts to bring out the spirit of innovation within the company (Anthony, 2012). Starting from 
this view, it can be concluded that how companies facilitate employees is crucial in fostering an entrepreneurial 
orientation, which in turn can be a solution for growing company performance.

Abstract 
In South Africa, local governments are primarily responsible for service delivery. The purpose of this research was to 
look into the factors that contribute to poor service delivery in South African local government, with the City of 
Johannesburg (CoJ) serving as the unit of analysis. Fundamentally, two critical questions had to be addressed: what 
are the major factors contributing to the CoJ metropolitan municipality's poor public service delivery? Second, what 
strategies can be implemented in the CoJ metropolitan municipality to improve public service delivery? The study 
used quantitative research methods with the support of the survey research strategy. Online questionnaires were 
distributed to 100 participants via the Google forms platform, yielding a useful response rate of 56%. Poor public 
office ethics, a lack of adequate resource capacity, a lack of strategic awareness by key personnel, a lack of staff 
training and development, undue political interference, a lack of digital transformation, and a lack of accountability 
and transparency were among the top-ranked contributing factors to poor public service delivery, according to the 
findings of this study. Finally, the study's findings and recommendations are hoped to assist the CoJ metropolitan 
municipality and provide a paradigm shift in the South African local government sphere in terms of improving public 
service delivery.

1. Introduction
Local governments have taken the lead in implementing sociopolitical and economic transformations (Van De Waldt 
2021). The state extends basic public service delivery functions to local communities via local government structures. 
Local government services and functions include electricity and gas supply, municipal health services, water and 
sanitation, refuse removal, municipal public transportation, municipal roads and stormwater systems, street trading, 
libraries, and other public facilities, firefighting services, abattoirs and fresh food markets, land use decisions, parks 
and recreational areas, and local tourism.  However, society suffers numerous consequences as a result of 
municipalities' poor public service delivery on the basic functions outlined for development or provision, operations 
and maintenance. Studies suggest that local governments in low- and middle-income countries persist in offering poor 
public service delivery (The World Bank 2021; Zon et al. 2017). Globally, contaminated drinking water due to a lack 
of safe water sources and sanitation is estimated to cause 829 000 death annually (WHO 2019). According to a 
comparative survey conducted by Rothstein and Nicholas (2017), poor service delivery by local governments is a 
global issue, including in South Africa. 
In South Africa, the local government faces numerous service delivery functional challenges related to efficient 
supply, operation, and maintenance to meet citizens' basic needs and demands (Kanyane, 2016). Between 2002 and 
2019, the percentage of households whose solid waste was collected weekly or less frequently decreased from 66,4 
per cent in 2018 to 61,5 per cent in 2019, and access to water decreased in five provinces, with observations in 
Mpumalanga (5,3%), Limpopo (3,8 %), and Free State (3,7 %)(Statistics South Africa 2019). Furthermore, the South 
African auditor general reported that 46 and 55 per cent of municipalities in South Africa had no approved road 
maintenance plan or priority list for the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years, respectively(Makwetu 2018). 
Poor service delivery by local governments has long-term socioeconomic and environmental consequences for the 
communities and ecosystems under their jurisdiction. Protests against the South African local government were

It is recommended that an effort be made in the CoJ administration to clear the blurred lines between political 
interference and intervention in order to improve and accelerate public service delivery. The relationship between the 
two parallel streams of local government, oversight (governance) and administrative departments (MoEs) must be 
harmonized. 
 
5.4 Validation  
Saunders et al. (2019) define reliability in research studies as the instrument's consistency in producing a stable and 
error-free result, including the quality of the processes and the details of the procedures to replicate the study result. 
Cronbach's Alpha is used to assess internal consistency. In this study, Cronbach's alpha was used to assess internal 
consistency using IBM Statistics Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) Version 27 and a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet 
(Makanyeza, et al., 2013). Cronbach's Alpha values of 0.7 and higher assessed how well the Likert scale items 
complement one another, and the factors influencing the scale's reliability were justified. In this study, we used content 
validity through a literature review and pilot study as suggested by Qu and Dumay (2011). In addition, we used the 
face validation method to improve the questionnaire structure and language. Three COJ municipal employees and one 
master's candidate colleague were asked to participate in the pilot study, and all recommended miscommunications, 
ambiguities, and malfunctions were resolved. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The problem of poor service delivery in South Africa is primarily the responsibility of local governments. The goal 
of this study was to investigate the current factors contributing to slowed service delivery in South African local 
government, using the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) as the unit of analysis. Fundamentally, two critical questions were 
to be asked: what are the major contributing factors to poor public service delivery in the CoJ metropolitan 
municipality? Second, which strategies can best accelerate the CoJ metropolitan municipality's poor public service 
delivery? Several contributing factors were identified in the study's literature review. The study used quantitative 
research methods with the support of the survey research strategy. The study further used a questionnaire with close-
ended questions as a data collection tool. 
 
 The findings revealed that, amongst others, poor public office ethics, lack of adequate resource capacity, lack of 
strategic awareness by key personnel, lack of staff training & development, undue political interference, lack of digital 
transformation, the lack of accountability & transparency were the top-ranked contributing factors towards decelerated 
public service delivery raised within the CoJ. Meaningful stakeholder engagement and public participation, employee 
skill development, and hiring adequate and qualified candidates were rated as the top strategies that could help to 
improve service delivery in the CoJ municipality. Depoliticizing and professionalizing local government was ranked 
last among all strategies. It is expected that this study would contribute to and inspire a constructive argument to 
debate possible management strategies for the identified problems confronting the local government. Finally, it is 
further hoped that the findings and recommendations of this study would assist the CoJ metropolitan municipality and 
offer a paradigm shift in the local government sphere in South Africa as far as accelerated public service delivery is 
concerned. 
 
The study's limitations include the fact that it was only conducted in one local municipality (the CoJ metropolitan 
municipality) in South Africa. It would be ideal to study and compare results from various municipalities in South 
Africa and around the world. Some service delivery factors within the CoJ metropolitan municipality are dynamic. As 
a result, this study was unable to address all of the factors associated with poor service delivery within the municipality. 
The opinions expressed in the results were limited to the Likert scale items created by the researcher. It would be more 
beneficial to allow respondents to express their individual perspectives on the subject using their words in future 
research.

Abstract 
This study sought to examine the relationship between the components of emotional intelligence and SME’s 
performance. Using the resource-based view and the emotional intelligence concept as the theoretical foundations, a 
census of 1,532 SMEs was selected in the Accra Metropolis for the study.  Empirical results from 717 SMEs, 
utilising the hierarchical linear regression model, revealed that owner/manger’s emotional intelligence can be used 
to help facilitate work relationships resulting in sales and market performances. Moreover, the study found that 
Emotional intelligence makes a positive effect on SMEs performance of small and medium-sized enterprises. The 
practical implications of the results are also discussed

Abstract 
The rapid expansion of electronic commerce or e-commerce in the recent years is increasingly blurring the boundary 
between ""conventional"" and ""electronic"" commerce. Despite the rapid growth, e-commerce needs improvements for 
better adoption and efficient usage. This paper examined forces driving the adoption and usage of e-commerce in retail 
sectors within Johannesburg, South Africa. The study used quantitative approach and collected data from about 100 
business owners and consumers in Johannesburg North using structured questionnaire. The study revealed that the 
internal driving force has contributed to the adoption of e-commerce, including initiation by owners, clients and 
service providers. It was observed that the business owners are being driven to adopt e-commerce (i) due to 
recommendations from business associates, (ii) for competitive advantage, and (iii) to cater for customers’ online 
preferences. They mostly reported using Internet and websites to promote their products and search for new or 
potential suppliers, as well as to order goods from suppliers and send electronic invoices to customers.

1. Introduction
In a conventional commerce, even a single transaction takes a long time to mature, for instance a manufacturer sells 
the product to a whole seller through a middleman, then the whole seller will sell the product to different retailers and 
finally the customer will purchase the product from the retailer. This chain will introduce more middleman if the 
difference between supplier and consumer is very far apart (Yadav and Sharma, 2014). This method is very time 
consuming and adds some margin of cost and eventually raise the price of the commodity which would place an extra 
pressure on the buying power of the customer. To speed-up this process and lower the add-on-value in the cost of 
commodity or to reduce the pressure on the buying power of the consumer, one requires e-commerce (Yadav and 
Sharma, 2014). However, the adoption and usage of e-commerce needs proper planning, resources and infrastructure, 
as well as conducive environment.  
Since its conception, e-commerce has taken the conventional sector by surprise. It is developing a whole digital 
economy, which has tremendous promise and is radically transforming the way business is conducted. The modern-
day e-commerce started with the advent of exchange of information over the Internet (Tornatzky and Fleischer, 1990; 
Whiteley, 2000). It includes delivery of products or services and payments through any online service platform, which 
enables the automation of business transactions, increases delivery speed and reduced service cost (Kalakota and 
Whinton, 1997). It is being adopted in every business, from large manufacturing companies, retailers and service 
industry to small off-site businesses. It is also known as e-business, web advertising and e-showcasing to name the 
few (Chaffey et al., 2006).   
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are essential driving force for economic growth and job creation and play an 
important role as innovation centers (OECD, 2013; BER, 2016; Rathaba, 2019, SEDA, 2020). The adoption of e-
commerce can provide several opportunities for SMEs, such as improved external communication, enhanced company 
image and brand, increased processing speed, extended market reach, reduced costs, reduced physical limitations of 
time and space (Jahanshahi et al., 2013; Rahayu and Day, 2017). However, there are some associated barriers, such 
as security and privacy issues, lack of required infrastructure and knowledge (Savrul et al., 2014; Rahayu and Day, 
2017). In 2014, the government of South African established the Ministry of Small Business Development to recognize

3.4 Discussion 
E-businesses can be run and operated by fewer number of people or even by a single person as opposed to traditional
organizations. The owners are central to the initiation of technology adoption in their businesses; however, e-
businesses are also being driven by customers. This internal drive has enabled the successful adoption and usage of
technology for SMEs under study. Frequent updates and easy access to information and products being offered by
businesses has boosted customer base. Increasing customer base and role of media platforms has provided competitive 
advantage for e-businesses. Most businesses use some form of technology to run their operations, for instance use of
Internet and official websites to promote products and to search for potential suppliers were popular among the
businesses. Adoption of technology has enabled businesses to receive and send electronic invoices, online
communication and transactions with consumers and suppliers, as well as many other administrative processes
including e-filing of taxes.
4. Conclusion
Several studies have found that companies in developed nations have benefited from the lucrative opportunities of e-
commerce; however, limited studies have assessed how companies in developed countries can benefit from the 
opportunities associated with e-commerce. The purpose of this research was to determine the driving forces and 
reasons of the adoption and usage of e-commerce in SMEs within retail sector of Johannesburg, South Africa. The 
findings revealed that company owners are the driving force behind the introduction of electronic technology, which 
indicates that owners are taking a positive initiative regarding e-commerce. Additionally, business associates, 
employees and consumers have influenced the adoption of electronic technologies. Several benefits provided by e-
commerce will be useful for successful running of businesses and their operations.

3.3 Application of Common Technologies in the Business 
Figure 5 presents common applications of technologies within SMEs under study. It highlights that the SMEs under 
study are using technology for different purposes, including communication, administrative processes and promoting 
their products online. Majority of the respondents (96%) reported the availability of Internet connection in the premises 
within their organization, and 85% indicated possession of official enterprise website. It was observed that the use of 
official websites to promote the company's products are popular among e-businesses. About 78% of the respondents 
reported to use the Internet to search for potential suppliers, while 77% reported to use the Internet for sharing 
information between the company and the government tax agency and also submitting online tax returns. Majority of 
the respondents also mentioned using technologies for administrative procedures (84%), and communications (e.g., 
email) (81%). The findings highlighted a high usage of basic technologies in SMEs.

Abstract 
A top priority for most countries and major organizations is to focus on actions to align with the 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) established by the United Nations in 2015. Today, the installed capacity of wind 
generation is steadily growing worldwide, while 34,000 wind turbines are 15 years or older. Furthermore, the number 
of decommissioned wind turbines is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. In this context, the 
evaluation of the waste management processes for wind turbine decommissioning in terms of sustainability is 
imperative. Wind turbine decommissioning options have to comply with SDGs linked to the safe disposal and/or 
recycling of energy production systems. This study aims to develop an indicator-oriented framework to evaluate the 
environmental, economic, and social impacts generated by different decommissioning scenarios of a wind turbine 
system to ensure it complies with these goals. Initially, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is performed to generate 
values for indicators that are related to each decommissioning scenario. Next, those indicators that are directly related 
to selected SDGs are identified. The proposed methodology applies Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess the 
efficiency of alternative wind turbine decommissioning scenarios based on selected criteria. These criteria are directly 
related to the previously identified indicators satisfying specific SDGs. Alternative decommissioning scenarios are 
benchmarked using different sustainability criteria/indicators as DEA inputs/outputs and utilized to determine best 
practice-based decision-making strategies. The joint application of LCA and DEA could represent a methodological 
framework for sustainability assessment and benchmark definition of waste management alternatives.

Abstract 
The topic is a discrimination related to e-KTP/Kartu Tanda Penduduk electronic in transpuan/transwoman circles. The 
Balinese used to be tolerant toward sexual marginality. A narrow re-interpretation of tradition and scriptures sometimes 
brings about new attitudes of repression. The government, instead of protecting transwomen as it does in advanced 
countries, does little. Many transpuans/transwomen originate from outside Bali and the civil registration office 
includes them among the “kaum rentan” fragile or marginal groups; transpuan, the gepeng/gelandangan (bums) and 
the mentally-ill people. Many make do without identity card (e-KTP), creating  social discrimination and disruption in 
personal life. This article focusses on a group called the Pretty Transpuan/Warcan located in Ubung, north of 
Denpasar. The data shows that they are subjected to all sorts of coercion and violence. This coercion often consists of 
illegal fees (KIPEM as Kartu Indentitas Penduduk Musiman as migrants permit) they are requested to pay. Protection 
is thus an issue; some hire preman (thugs) to protect them, even though it is now rarer due to the pandemic. However, 
institutional steps do exist: the Disdukcapil/civil registration regency offices is registering all citizens, including the 
“kaum rentan”’, but does not always do it properly. Exit politics (Connell, 1995; 220) which is episodic suggests 
skilful actors helping transpuans to gain e-KTP registration.

1. Introduction
Transgender is a little-known phenomenon, which is also found in Balinese society. This society used to be tolerant 
toward sexual marginality. Some of the Balinese dances show so called “gender fluidity” where the men  become 
women in dance groups or solo performances or vice versa. This kind of fluidity is found for instance in  “Calonarang” 
dance or in the “Gambuh” classical performance where the male role of Panji is usually played by a woman. Geertz 
discusses this fluidity in his book Negara, the Theater State (1980), where he mentions the existence of transgender 
people. Until today transgender performers are found in the Gandrung and also Arja Muani dance in which a male 
dancer sings in female way. However, nowadays a narrow re-interpretation of tradition and scriptures sometimes 
brings about attitudes of repression. When a Balinese family is faced with the  reality of one of their members displaying 
gender fluidity, this tradition of tolerance is increasingly being openly  denied. Is this change caused by the Islamic 
ethics prevalent in Indonesia? Probably. 
In another South-East Asian society such as Thailand, transgender is a fully acknowledged and widely accepted 
gender-friendly social phenomenon. Thai parents often authorize hormonal treatments to turn their son into a 
woman or vice versa, even though the latter case is less common. In the past, “discrimination was absent”, but now, 
when the Balinese accept sexual marginality, it is with more and more reservation as discovered by Zuryani and 
Erviantono (2021: 235) in North Bali where Wargas members like to be called transpuans a social signal to be 
accepted and gain acceptance as it has positive meaning (Trans; puan is the lady). This article also addresses the 
transwoman as a transpuan. This Wargas association in North Bali is also available to gain recognition from the 
surrounding community since the 1990s. In any case sexual transactions among them that they call it as “nyebong” is 
still taking place. However, most of the trans-ladies in Wargas work and is actively participating in social events, 
including fund raising and distributing 9 basic foods during Covid pandemic in 2020 to this present time. The case of 
Wargas as an association in the north of Bali is particularly interesting. Its head, Mami SC, once explained how she 
manages to get performing jobs or other jobs (such as teaching English for kids who is doing on line schooling during

used as a bridge to identify a person and enable that person to get a real e-KTP from a KK with bar code as family card 
document. As the other main proof of identity is only the family card, or Kartu Keluarga, because it is NIK recorded 
in the center of Dirjen Dukcapil data base in Jakarta. The Disdukcapil is regency office available in every district, city 
and regency all over Indonesia. Otherwise, it is almost impossible to get an  e-KTP, unless there is a “miracle”, as 
above with the police woman. 
 
As digitalization is expanding exponentially under the spur of the pandemic, and as sanitary steps are been taken using 
this information technology, it becomes ever more important to solve the e-KTP issue for marginal groups  such as 
transpuan. In the “Peduli Lindungi” platform, the entrance data, beside the registered mobile phone number, is also 
the NIK (Nomor Induk Kependudukan or National Registration Population Number) stated in every e-KTP. This is 
obtained through registration of the family head (kepala keluarga) card that is compulsory to have for each of 
household in Indonesia. In the future, the Dukcapil on line platform could be a primary source of data all over Indonesia. 
The KK, BPJS and Bank account platforms are already synchronized with one another and with the process can be done 
through the Disdukcapil on line under the name of Taring Dukcapil. Therefore, all citizens can gain access to the system 
and vice-versa. And it is ever expanding: an Akuwaras platform is now being set up as a health database for Denpasar’s 
population, and also the taxation records should follow suit. 
 
The transpuans want gender social justice. They want to be given the right to have a look (say a female) that does  not 
correspond to their e-KTP registered gender (say male). It should not be an issue, if we take into account to face that 
gender fluidity has a long history behind it in Balinese dance and theater. Yet there is discrimination. It is now time 
to stop it by properly processing their e-KTP. The Disdukcapil officers especially men officers, should not mock 
transpuans or be reluctant to register them. No cis men or cis women should be allowed to shame or expel transpuan 
under any pretext, even religious basis. A professional approach should be expected of all Disdukcapil officials when 
processing papers. Referring to Connell (1995) this can be construed as an episode of  exit politics. Episodic or not, 
gender justice has to be paramount. We should achieve inclusive treatment for marginal people. 
 
When we consider Tilly’s three metaphors about the prospects of democratization (1995), we need skillful actors to 
protect marginal people from any injustice treatments. As everyone at this moment hold a mobile phone to get out of 
the check point by installing “Peduli Lindungi” application. This application platform is made available  by the Ministry 
of Interior Affairs as government method to trace back the mobility of population during Corona  pandemic in 
Indonesia. Beside personal data, this application could save the vaccination certificates as the collective action to 
prevent the Covid-19 infections and contaminations. It has also method to do scan the QR code at every public space 
that open for public and a method to trace and to let in who enter the properties. Therefore, transpuans are among 
those who can enter public area without any problem as long as the application is running well and she could pass the 
check point without problem. 
 
The more this collective action is becoming popular, the expected outcome will create more open mindedness of 
people toward transgenders and they are becoming actors who appreciate human rights. The transpuans can have  their 
face full of make up in their photo taken and posted in the necessary document that showing of their identity. They can 
freely walk down the street or in the malls, in the public and private properties with their personal attributes that are 
not heteronormative. As long as they hold a proper KTP which is electronic, then they must be inclusively treated as 
normal citizens, not as the marginal groups as formally include those mentally ill people nor the homeless or the 
bums. Unless they create problems openly and commit criminality. Social justice appreciates even mentally ill people, 
the homeless, the beggar, the bums and transgender. They have their own pride as human beings although they are 
minority among heteronormative majority of people. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Gender theories (Buttler, 1990; Connell, 1995), can contribute to a search of solutions for the transpuan’s e-KTP issue 
in Bali. This issue is a little bit sensitive and therefore, this article aims at investigating social justice toward this minority 
group. Seen from the situation on the field, it appears clearly that the solutions are all non-local based and episodic, 
as well as an exit politics need to be implemented as suggested by Connell. It is the Suara Kita NGO from Jakarta that 
have incited Ms. TRS to seek recognition through the Badung and Denpasar Disdukcapil offices. In Singaraja the 
process went smoothly after Suara Kita got in touch with Mami SC in Singaraja, because Mami SC is a public figure 
and personally knows the regency head and the head of the Buleleng regency Disdukcapil. The exit politics advocated 
by Connell was played a major role in Wargas community through Mami SC. However, taking into account what

Tilly proposes three metaphors to shape multigenderism, those minorities are LGBT, they hold human rights as others. 
Transpuans among them are thought to be a lake, then skillful engineers can build one in a valley with a river and 
plenty of space for the lake behind a dam, the skillful actors then build up the lake of multigenderism but not in a vast, 
flat desert, they build it in a proper manners and gratitude toward gender diversity. Although in some places, there are 
also times and places when a lake forms naturally, we need a skillful engineer to make transpuan rights to get their e-
KTP available. In Denpasar and Badung, the south part of Bali, it was seemingly much more difficult, with the solution 
often being found through episodic personal assistance (usually women who help the transpuans). 
The episode of male clericals at the public service who was reluctant to help, this is undoubtedly part of social injustice. 
In the public sphere, they are actors who supposedly do more professional service with all the standard operating 
procedure to implement inclusive treatments for all. Public space is neutral and people nowadays hold their mobile 
phones to show more regarding registration on one to other platforms that permit them entering public space freely 
(initially, it was e-HAC platform). Everyone has their mobile application chosen and further data collection are needed 
when talking about ‘a must have mobile application’. Such as the “Peduli-Lindungi” is now one primary platform 
available a during Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. 
The more complete this available application, it is expected to be more user friendly and give more protections to each 
individual. Collective action needs to be encouraged by using “Peduli Lindungi” so as holding the e-KTP  as the 
expected outcome will be that, the actors as social engineer would appreciate human rights. The transpuans  can have 
their face full of make up with women outfit to be photographed and this picture could be posted in the necessary 
document that part of their identity although the gender is still a man. No public places could be prohibited for 
transpuans to freely walk and gather with their personal attributes that are non-heteronormative. However, to close the 
discussion, finally no discrimination should ever take place when transpuans need to get their data registration. They 
should have the possibility to register as male with a male name and gender as long as it is what is stated in their Kartu 
Keluarga, or by the court and each of them should then be given an e-KTP as national regulation. Besides that, if they 
want to have a female photograph of her own face on this card, this should be allowed. When gender justice is 
considered, no short-sighted moralistic judgment should be allowed to interfere.

Abstract 
Performance is a benchmark in determining an institution's excellent or flawed condition, both government and private 
institutions. Performance is measured in various models and aspects, such as culture, economy, politics, etc. This 
research was conducted at the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) office of South Sulawesi 
Province. It was carried out for 2 (two) months, starting from June 2020 to August 2020. The population in this study 
were all employees based in the Provincial ESDM Office South Sulawesi, with a population of 117 employees where 
the sampling technique used saturated sampling. The method of collecting data was done by interview, questionnaire 
(questionnaire), and observation, while data analysis used path analysis. The results showed that: 1) The effect of 
information quality on the quality of supervision showed significant results with a path coefficient of 0.492 (positive) 
; 2) The effect of information quality on employee performance also shows significant results with a path coefficient 
of 0.331 (positive) ; 3) The effect of service quality on the quality of supervision shows significant results with a path 
coefficient of 0.251 (positive) ; 4) The effect of service quality on employee performance also shows significant results 
with a path coefficient of 0.377 (positive) ; 5) The effect of the quality of supervision on employee performance shows 
a significant result with a path coefficient of 0.471 (positive) ; 6) The effect of information quality on employee 
performance through mediation of the quality of supervision shows significant results with a path coefficient of 0.176 
(positive) ; and 7) The influence of service quality on employee performance through mediation of quality supervision 
also shows significant results with a path coefficient of 0.102 (positive).

Abstract 
The stagnation of the construction of Blimbing Market causes losses suffered by various parties, including the 
government, developers and traders. This study discusses the dynamics of Blimbing Market development conflicts. 
This study aims to analyze the dynamics of conflict development of Malang City Blimbing Market. The study found 
that the stagnation of Blimbing Market development occurred due to differences in views between the parties to the 
conflict. This research uses a qualitative approach and data collection with literature review techniques. This study 
will attempt to map the development conflicts of Blimbing Market based on Kenneth E. Boulding's thinking 
consisting of conflict history, conflict context, conflict parties, issues, dynamics, and alternative routes to solution. 
Based on this study that the stagnation of Blimbing Market development occurs due to differences in views between 
the parties to the conflict, namely; First, between the Government of Malang and Karya Indah Sukses Ltd., second, 
the difference in views between Blimbing Market traders, third, differences in views between traders, fourth, 
differences in views between the Malang City Government and Karya Indah Sukses Ltd.  as an investor. This study 
refutes Lewis Coser's argument that conflict can not always strengthen internal relationships within a group, but that 
conflict can actually divide groups that were initially solid to be not solid. This happens to Blimbing Market traders 
when responding to the revitalization of Bimbing Market, traders are split into two, namely traders who are traders 
who do not want to move from Blimbing Market and traders who are willing to move to the shelter market.

1. Introduction
Traditional markets have occupied an important position in people's lives. For the community, traditional markets 
are a meeting place for buyers and sellers and a place for social interaction and the values of local wisdom, which 
are shown by the behaviour of the actors in it (Bangsawan et al. 2017). Traditional markets function as a forum for 
social processes for people to interact and communicate with each other (Sasanto and Yusuf, 2010). However, the 
traditional market is synonymous with outdated facilities, road access that is not worth going through, parking space 
facilities that are less spacious and the arrangement of traders' less neat stalls (Andre et al., 2017; Sasanto and Yusuf, 
2010;  Ainul et al., 2019). 
Even so, according to das Nair (2018) and Traill (2006) Traditional Markets still get middle-class customers even 
though theoretically they choose to go to the modern market because the modern market is considered a place for

1. Introduction
Human resources contained in companies and agencies are the main assets in carrying out the organizational process. 
As the role of humans in achieving organizational goals is the main factor for its success. The existing human resources 
must be utilized as much as possible to become agents of change, not the other way around that is damaging to the

Abstract 
Kampung Tangguh Semeru Wani Jogo Suroboyo is a program initiated by the Surabaya City Government to combat 
the COVID-19 outbreak. This innovation is a replication of the National Kampung Tangguh program but was created 
with the local language of Surabaya. This program is an integration of various interrelated programs to combat covid 
from multiple fields. This article studied using the library research method. As a result, the use of the local dialect 
succeeded in creating a close bond between the community and the program. This bonding has a significant impact 
on the effectiveness of this program to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. Even though statistically, the number of 
COVID-19 sufferers in Surabaya did not decrease directly after the program was launched, this program was able to 
reduce the negative impacts, especially on the socio-cultural aspects of the community. Through collaborative 
innovation using the local language typical of Surabaya, the community becomes more familiar with the function of 
this program to increase the active participation of all elements of society. In addition, this innovative program with a 
local language can make other parts of the Penta helix collaboration scheme feel like a unified whole in fighting the 
COVID-19 outbreak.

I. Introduction
The Coronavirus was first reported to have plagued Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, a province in China, in 
December 2019. At that time, the local government said that this virus had caused at least 2500 people to die. Slowly 
but surely, this virus then infected many people. On 30 January 2020, WHO stated that a new Coronavirus pandemic 
had hit the world, later named Corona Virus Disease 2019 or COVID-19. The rapid development of the virus then 
spread to several Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, 
etc. Even the speed of transmission of the virus can give birth to new epicenters such as in Iran and several countries 
on the Australian and European continents such as Italy and Spain. Starting from these two countries, the spread of 
the COVID-19 virus hit almost all European countries. Not long after that, this plague crossed the Atlantic Ocean to 
the Americas. The United States, the superpower, then became a new epicenter of the spread, with the number of 
patients reaching 1.7 million and dying as many as 100 thousand people (Susilo et al., 2020). 
In its development, Indonesia has also become one of the countries affected by the Coronavirus. The first confirmed 
case is patient 01, and patient 02 is a resident of Depok, West Java, announced directly by President Joko Widodo on 
2 March 2020. Confirmation of this case later became a new chapter of public and government attention to the handling 
of COVID-19. After 2 March 2020, the increase in positive cases of COVID-19 is increasingly showing an increasing 
trend. The COVID-19 Task Force noted that as of 27 May 2020, there were 23,581 confirmed positive patients, 6,057 
who had recovered, and 1,473 patients who died due to the COVID-19 virus (Covid-19, 2020).

The Penta helix collaboration between the City Government, the Community, Academics, the Private Sector, and the 
Media was subsequently observed to be more effective thanks to the use of the typical Suroboyo dialect as the 
program's name. The use of the Suroboyoan dialect to increase the effectiveness of this program is based on several 
policy best practices that occurred in several regions and past central-scale policies. The use of the Suroboyan dialect 
increases self-confidence and strong bonds between members of the community. The community feels that they have 
found their brother and get attention all the time. The use of this typical local dialect can be considered as a 
representation of respect for local wisdom. 
 
 
Figure 4. The Penta helix Collaboration 
 
Although COVID-19 is a national and global outbreak, people's needs are not the same (Figure 4). This is where the 
concept of Penta helix or multi-stakeholders plays a critical role in facilitating government programs. Respect for local 
wisdom through the involvement of local communities has a significant impact on delivering the maximum purpose 
of the program to the community. This is in accordance with the breath of decentralization that society no longer acts 
only as an object of policy but also as a subject of policy. As a policy object, people have distinctive characteristics 
that may not be the same in one region as another, so it takes the participation of the community to know the specific 
needs so that the government policy is by their needs. In mapping these specific needs, the role of academics in the 
formulation of academic manuscripts by concepts and theories in science becomes urgent as well. Some studies say 
that the government can appropriately solve not all disasters due to the problem of norms and culture, and religion in 
a place that will care about solving the problem. Therefore, the government must be open and empower the community 
to minimize new problems that will arise by being involved in solving the occurrence of natural disasters. This is an 
essential step in choosing a strategy for risk reduction and strengthening community capabilities. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The Kampung Tangguh Semeru Wani Jogo Suroboyo Program is a derivative program of the National Kampung 
Tangguh program. While the Kampung Tangguh program targets people throughout Indonesia in general, Kampung 
Tangguh Wani Jogo Suroboyo adopts a psychological approach among Surabaya residents by utilizing local dialect 
terminology typical of Surabaya. The use of regional dialects is expected to strengthen bonds between communities 
so that the effectiveness of this program can be more optimal. This collaborative innovation by adopting local dialects 
has succeeded in controlling the negative impact of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Surabaya. Although 
numerical data states that Surabaya City had become a black zone, thanks to the collaboration between the community, 
government, private sector, academia, and the media, the social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can be 
appropriately controlled. Social relations between citizens, which are predicted to fall apart due to the pandemic, have 
happened the other way around. Thanks to a shared commitment built with the typical Suroboyo slogan, the 
community became more concerned about each other. Bonding with fellow citizens of Surabaya has increased public 
awareness, not only social concern but concern for economic, security, and health aspects, so that it can be concluded 
that the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic will be more effective using policies that are based on local wisdom.

The success of the Penta helix collaboration at Kampung Tangguh Wani Jogo Suroboyo teaches us that amid the 
diversity in Indonesia, policies with a local wisdom perspective can be more effective in controlling the negative 
impacts of this pandemic. This paper intends to remind that in the future, the central government will provide more 
portions for regions to formulate disaster or pandemic management policies by their local wisdom. The central 
government needs to develop a master policy and establish policy boundaries, such as budgeting, monitoring, and 
evaluation.

Abstract 
As a forum for providing services to the community, public organizations must be supported by quality human 
resources. Inseparable from the human resource development system and the culture of the public organization in 
creating superior human resources and having good performance so that the services provided can increase community 
satisfaction. This research is a type of quantitative research, with a survey method conducted at the Personnel 
Education and Training Agency, the Population and Civil Registry Office, and five District Offices in Central Mamuju 
Regency. The population in this study amounted to 102 people. Data collection was carried out by distributing

1. Introduction
Entering the industrial era 4.0, public organizations as a forum for providing services to the community have a tough 
challenge. Public organizations are required to be able to compete with private organizations in providing services. 
Existing employees must operate all online-based systems to streamline and streamline service delivery to the 
community. From several research results that several previous researchers have conducted. It is known that the 
inability of employees to implement online-based service delivery is caused by the lack of available facilities and 
infrastructure, the lack of employee skills, and an organizational culture that is not innovative in change (Najoan, 
2015; Christin, 2006).

to pay attention to; according to them, completing work quickly does not guarantee good work results. In addition, 
good culture of cooperation between employees in carrying out their duties so far also supports the quality of service 
in Central Mamuju Regency. Employees are aware of their respective duties. 
 
The results of research data analysis show that human resources development on employee performance has a positive 
effect. The results obtained are in line with research (Panjaitan, 2017), which shows that education and training, both 
the provision of education and training, and non-training affect employee performance. 
 
Employees in Central Mamuju District have the desire to work better every day. Employees will never see their 
coworkers having difficulty doing work; employees are willing to help each other and work together to find solutions 
to solve problems. In addition, employees at public service agencies in Central Mamuju Regency view that their 
difficulties in doing their work are not a threat but an opportunity to give birth to innovations. This is also influenced 
by leaders who always share knowledge and skills with their subordinates. And always motivate them to work 
according to their respective abilities. 
 
The results of the research data analysis showed that organizational culture on employee performance had a positive 
effect. A strong corporate culture can influence employees. Organizational culture can be used as an organizational 
foundation to control employees in making changes. When employees make organizational culture a unique culture, 
a sense of belonging will arise in the employee's soul to realize optimal performance. 
 
The results of these studies indicate that when the organization's culture is good, the performance of employees in the 
public service sector will be good too. In other words, when the organizational culture has increased in influencing 
employees at work, it will improve employee performance and vice versa. If the corporate culture has decreased in 
affecting employees, the employee performance will decrease. 
 
The analysis of research data indicates that employee performance on the quality of public services has a positive 
effect. Employee performance will affect the existence of an organization because organizational performance 
depends on the performance of its employees. Like organizations engaged in public services, the quality of service 
and public trust in services is primarily determined by the performance of employees in providing services. 
 
In addition, employees' commitment to completing work makes people feel satisfied with the service they receive. 
Because employees try their best to do their work according to what society wants. Employees at public service 
agencies in Central Mamuju Regency also prepare all facilities and infrastructure to make the community comfortable 
while waiting for employees to complete their work. 
 
The results of the analysis of research data indicate that human resource development influences the quality of public 
services through employee performance, although not significantly. The knowledge, skills, and abilities of employees 
in public service agencies in Central Mamuju Regency obtained during education and training when they are expected 
to do their jobs will produce a good performance, resulting in quality public services. Conversely, when employees 
are unable or trying to apply knowledge and experience while carrying out education and training, of course, it will 
not improve their performance, so that the services provided will not be able to satisfy the community. 
 
The results of the research data analysis show that organizational culture has a positive effect on the quality of public 
services through employee performance. A healthy corporate culture reflects a good organization that can 
communicate organizational goals to employees to produce a good performance in providing services. 
 
Suppose the culture of public service agencies in Central Mamuju Regency is unhealthy and unable to unite the unique 
culture of employees at work. In that case, it will undoubtedly result in poor quality services because employees will 
tend to do work according to their habits and rules. When this happens, of course, employees at work do not have 
exemplary commitment, cooperation between fellow employees and do not have a good relationship with the 
leadership. So that in providing services will reap problems. On the other hand, when the culture of public service 
agencies in Central Mamuju District is healthy and able to unite the unique culture of employees at work, it will 
undoubtedly produce quality services because employees will work according to organizational rules.

Abstract 
Efficiency and responsiveness are widely identified supply chain strategies and capabilities. In most of the supply 
chain fit literature, a positive relationship between efficient/responsive strategy and performance has been presumed. 
However, the question is left unanswered whether these strategies are indeed positively related to performance and, if 
so, how. The answer is not straightforward, particularly when efficiency, a widely accepted supply chain strategy, is 
also considered a standard qualifier that may not be an order winner in a competitive marketplace. In this work, we 
ask whether these strategies are indeed positively related to performance. Specifically, we aim to answer the following 
research question: are efficient and responsive strategies and capabilities effective in achieving performance 
improvements? Specifically, we consider the two dimensions of efficiency and responsiveness as directed by the 
supply chain strategy and indicated by the operational capability. Based on the competence-based theory (CBT) of the 
firm, we propose a conceptual framework between strategy-driven innovation, competitive capability and 
performance, and specify the associations in both efficiency and responsiveness dimensions. A large dataset from 
New Zealand (NZ) businesses is used to test the relationships, and access to the data is obtained from Statistics New 
Zealand. We also examine the mediating role of competitive capability in both to the relationship, and investigate how 
these associations differ with product characteristics. Overall, we find a negative relationship in the efficiency 
dimension and a positive association in the responsiveness dimension. While the mediation effects are generally 
supported, the hypothesized moderation effects are partially supported as product type moderates the relationships in 
a direction opposite from what is suggested in the supply chain fit theory. As such, this work improves our 
understanding of how strategies in efficiency versus responsiveness can affect firm performance. We make several 
contributions. First, we contribute to the growing supply chain fit literature, by evaluating the mediating role of 
operational capabilities in both dimensions and answering whether and how efficient and responsive strategies 
improve performance. We find that product type moderates the relationships in the opposite direction from what is 
suggested by the supply chain fit theory. Second, we contribute to the supply chain strategy literature and find that 
efficiency could be negatively associated with performance. Third, this work contributes to the current body of 
knowledge by empirically investigating the impact of efficient and responsive strategies for New Zealand exporters. 
Though results derived from single-country data might seem not immediately generalizable, this work provides 
important insights for businesses in New Zealand and other countries facing similar contexts; we hope this could 
inspire future work extending the study into other contexts.

Abstract 
The research objective was to determine and analyze the influence of motivation and competence on health care quality 
and its impact on patient satisfaction in the General Hospital (RSUD) Majene Regency at emergency department. The 
population in the study consisted of 185 employees with the status of Civil Servants and Emergency Inpatient (IGD) 
patients. The sampling technique was carried out through accidental sampling, meaning that it carried out the selection 
on anyone who happened to be met at that time, so they were directly used as the research sample. Data collection 
techniques are through observation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, while data analysis uses path 
analysis. The results showed that competence has a significant role in supporting the improvement of service quality. 
Competence is also able to affect patient satisfaction; better competence can keep increased patient satisfaction. Apart 
from competence, the motivation variable is another variable that plays a role in improving service quality and patient 
satisfaction. The motivation for health workers is shown by power, willingness, forming expertise, responsibility, and 
goals. The indirect effect is healthcare quality as a variable that can moderate the motivation and competence variables 
on patient satisfaction. Healthcare quality is an intervening variable that maximizes service functions to encourage 
patient satisfaction in receiving services. The influence of motivation on patient satisfaction through healthcare quality 
is an indirect effect, with the most negligible impact showing that it can feel patient satisfaction with a better level of 
service quality. The different thing in this study is the use of motivation and competence variables as independent 
variables. Achieving the level of satisfaction for patients is not always measured by competence alone. But with 
motivation is a predictor that triggers someone to maximize themselves with their competence to do something better 
and optimal.

Abstract 
The current research is aimed to evaluate some programs for poverty reduction that have, all this time, been 
implemented in some target locations of the research as a synchronization for poverty reduction initiated by the 
East Java Government in collaboration with the Regional Government. The research, further, was focused on a 
handling program for People with Social Welfare Problems (i.e., homeless, beggars, prostitutes, street children, 
and psychotic homeless) and an assistive program for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises that existed around 
the research’s target locations. Further, qualitative research method was used. In accordance with the findings 
on the handling program for People with Social Welfare Problems and the assistive program for Small and 
Medium-sized Enterprises in the locations, numerous strategical indicators were used to evaluate those 
programs. The indicators set in each of the locations included effectivity, adequacy, uniformity, and accuracy; 
all of which had been met. Nevertheless, in terms of responsivity, it still remained inadequate. It was due to the 
fact that responsivity required good balance between the urgency of the programs and the actual needs of the 
program recipients. To evaluate the success of those programs, indeed, public responses from the target 
communities, as the recipients, were needed to identify the degree of satisfaction with the running programs.

1. Introduction
The term poverty is literally referred to the state of being without any possessions (Lukman et. al. 1996). 
According to Indonesia Dictionary, it is referred to as poor. Meanwhile, the combination of the terms constructs 
a common term – the poor, meaning a condition of extreme deficiency. Benyamin White argues that poverty 
constitutes differences in criteria based on social welfare levels of a certain area from the others (Dilon and 
Hermanto 1993). In addition, Parsudi Suparlan defines it as a lower-levelled standard of life, with lack of 
material possessions, in comparison to standard of life common to a certain community (Lukman et. al. 1996).  
In Indonesia, poverty is being handled through some programs; some of which were directed by the Ministry of 
National Development Planning (BAPPENAS) and the National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty

Service. Handling Street Communities with Social Welfare Problems, including making a letter of assignment 
for a social assistance survey, coordination with Kusnadi Hospital regarding ODGJ People with Mental 
Disorders, coordination with the Bina Laras Unit, Pasuruan in Banyuwangi regarding People with Mental 
Disorders, and so forth. 
On the assistive programs for SMEs, the Regional Development Program through the Indicative Ceiling of 
Bondowoso Regency was focused on some priority programs for the escalation of microbusiness. In real-life 
practices, it was found that the priority programs for micro-scaled businesses such as: a series of training 
programs for human resources was meant for skill improvement; production activities needed productive 
facilitation for business actors; for capital, partnerships were made with banking institutions in order to provide 
the business actors with info and facilities to get approval for capital; s program under the Center for 
Independent Business Capital Assistance (BPUM) had received a lot of proposals – many of which were 
approved, and many were not, by the verification from the Center; on marketing aspect, partnership programs 
were carried out with modern retailers, i.e., Indomaret, Alfamart, and Bukalapak; sssistive programs for 
business actors were done in the alliance with several assistants. 
According to the aforesaid data, it can be concluded the assistive programs for MSMEs authorized by the 
Bondowoso Government were only targeted to microenterprises. It was because of the regional terms and 
conditions – in which the small-scaled belonged to the control of the Provincial Government, and the medium 
one under the control of the Central Government. 
Meanwhile, to evaluate the handling of the People with Social Welfare Problems and assistive programs for 
SMEs in the target areas of research, some indicators were fulfilled, while some others were not. In consort with 
the indicators used in each of target areas of research, some of which i.e., effectivity, adequacy, equity, and 
accuracy, had been copiously fulfilled. Nonetheless, in terms of responsivity, the indicator still remained 
unfulfilled. It was because the responsivity should indicate consistency between the programs and actual needs 
required by target recipients. In fact, to identify such an issue, the communities had to give response in order to 
express their satisfaction with the running programs, which constituted the part of evaluation on the exercises of 
the programs.

Abstract 
This paper aims to find out the effectiveness, usefulness, and negative responses of customers to the fruit and vegetable 
shopping applications. The theory used by the researcher is Digital Society according to Immanuel Castells. The 
results showed that from dozens of applications that sell fruit and vegetables, the applications Sayur Box, Happy 
Fresh, TaniHub,  and  Brambang  were the most widely used. The Sayur Box and Happy Fresh applications were 
downloaded by nearly 1 million subscribers, had 12-20 thousand reviews and investors from home and abroad. The 
positive and negative responses conveyed by customers in using the application are related to the ease of using the 
application, affordable fruit and vegetable prices (not much different from prices in supermarkets and markets), 
maintained product quality, speed of service, also friendly and quick response. The behavior of application users who 
feel the ease and speed of service cannot be separated from the characteristics of a digital society that prioritizes 
practicality and convenience with the presence of information technology. This includes expressing opinions that tend 
to be firm, straightforward, and impolite to become an inherent part of digital society.

1. Introduction
Marketing is an important part of the production process to make a profit. Agricultural products are traditionally 
marketed directly by farmers in traditional markets, through middlemen, traders, collectors or brokers, exporters, and 
importers. Agricultural products have several weaknesses related to market competence because of the nature of 
agricultural goods that are produced seasonally, always immediately (freashable), easily damaged, large amounts but 
small value. This is the reason why the value of agricultural products is so volatile. 
In this pandemic situation, the agricultural sector is one of the sectors driving the economy. However, in the marketing 
process it is not done directly, but rather uses the services of third parties, related to restrictions on movement and 
reducing crowding to encourage marketing. One form of marketing carried out by farmers is digital marketing, of 
course, related to the nature of agricultural products, with the hope that agricultural products will be selling 
continuously so that farmers will get the benefit (Sibarani 2021).. Marketing using digital platforms in Indonesia is 
increasingly widespread because during this pandemic the number of internet users is increasing rapidly. Based on 
data released by We Are Social in a report entitled Digital 2021, the number of internet users in Indonesia in early 
2021 reached 202.6 million out of a total population of 274.9 million. This means that internet users are 73.7%, with 
an increase in the number of users by 15.5% (Kompas 2021). The internet users based on gender, age, and the purpose 
of internet usage are very various.

6. Conclusion 
The flow of digitalization cannot be dammed, affecting people's lives, including meeting the daily needs of fruits and 
vegetables. The behavior of buying fruit and vegetables has changed, from traditional markets or supermarkets to 
online shopping trends, this happens considering the ease and benefits of applying them coupled with the pandemic 
situation that restricts movement outside the home. These factors cause fruit and vegetable shopping applications to 
grow and are widely downloaded by the digital community. In this study, it can be found that the use of fruit and 
vegetable shopping applications increases every year because of its convenience, speed, and quality which are not 
much different from the quality of goods from supermarkets and traditional markets. Judging from the application 
used, the more complet and easy to use, of course, the more people will use the application, this cannot be separated 
from the capital that funds it. The thing that needs to be educated and becomes a general trend of using language in 
social media is that the delivery of messages is more polite. The results of this study are very descriptive and only 
map the basic conditions of a digital society that uses fruit and vegetable shopping applications. This research needs 
to be followed up more deeply with consumers by contacting them for data clarification and further to farmers, whether 
they receive benefits from the presence of this application that facilitates the marketing of agricultural products.

employees were also evaluated by the Region Land Transportation Management, XIX Regency, South Sulawesi. 
Several previous studies, namely Ardana, found that work placements not by educational backgrounds can cause 
employee dissatisfaction. Meanwhile, Dwipalguna (2015) found that job placement has a positive effect on job 
satisfaction (Ardana et al. 2012). Likewise, with Ngebu stated that job placement has a positive impact and 
significant on job satisfaction (Ngebu et al. 2018). So, in this study in line with the results of the research found

The results of the analysis in this study indicate that efficiency is closely related to improving employee 
performance. It can be said that the competencies possessed by employees, such as educational levels and practical 
experience of employees in doing work, can improve work performance. This is because every employee in the 
XIX area of the South Sulawesi Land Transportation Service has skills, knowledge, and experience that can be 
relied upon so that they can improve work performance. 
The opinion expressed by Sedarmayanti is that talent is related to the essential traits of a person that will have a 
direct impact or can predict good work performance. Meanwhile, Rivai and Sagala (2018) state that competence 
is the primary determinant of a person in producing good performance, so it can be said that the opinions expressed 
by Sedarmayanti, Rivai and Sagala support these results. Of the research the researchers found (Sedarmayanti, 
2016; Rivai et al. 2018). 
Then several previous research results, especially Aprilda, found that job placement has a positive and significant 
effect on work performance. Meanwhile, the view put forward by Moeheriono is that talent has one's essential 
experience regarding the effectiveness of individual performance at work. Thus, this study is in line with Aprilda 
and supports Moeheriono's view that job placement affects employee performance (Aprilda, 2012; Moeheriono, 
2014). 
5.4. The effect of work placement on work performance 
Based on the analysis results in this study, the results obtained that work placement plays a significant role in 
improving work performance. It can be said that the proper work placement by skills, knowledge, or experience 
in doing work will have an impact on increasing work performance, especially in the Region Land Transportation 
Management, XIX Regency, South Sulawesi. This is in line with the research results found by previous 
researchers, namely Randa Randi. 
5.5. The effect of job placement on job performance through the satisfaction Work 
The results of the mediation test that have been carried out can be said that job satisfaction. The effect of job 
placement can mediate job performance. Thus, it can be concluded that recruitment by the skills, knowledge, and 
experience possessed by each employee will increase job satisfaction. It impacts employee performance at the 
19th Regional Road Transport Administration Office in South Sulawesi. Then from a search conducted by 
previous researchers, Randa Randi, job satisfaction can partially mediate job placement on work performance. 
This study is in line with what the researchers found (Randi, 2020). 
6. Conclusions
The employee already has experience carrying out his job, plus most employees already know about doing the 
job. The results in this study indicate that efficiency has a huge role in providing job satisfaction to employees, so 
it can be said that the more efficient employees are, the greater their ability to increase employee job satisfaction 
in Indonesia. The level of recruitment carried out by the leadership has been carried out well. Judging from the 
educational background, the level of recruitment has increased in employment. Then in job placement, it becomes 
a consideration for the superior in terms of job designation. 
Efficiency is closely related to improving employee performance. It can be said that the competencies possessed 
by employees, such as educational levels and practical experience of employees in doing work, can improve work 
performance. Work placement plays a significant role in improving work performance. It can be said that the 
proper work placement by skills, knowledge, or experience in doing work will have an impact on increasing work 
performance. The effect of job placement can mediate job performance. Thus, it can be concluded that recruitment 
by the skills, knowledge, and experience possessed by each employee will increase job satisfaction.

Abstract 
This study aimed to measure and analyze the effect of compensation and supervision on job satisfaction through the 
discipline of regional contract labor at the Regional General Hospital of Central Mamuju Regency. This research 
design is a survey. It conducted this research at the Regional General Hospital of Central Mamuju Regency. This 
research lasted for about two months, from August to September 2019. Data collection was done through observation, 
questionnaires, interviews, and documentation. The total sample is 100 people data analysis through research 
instrument test, validity test, reliability test, and path analysis. The results showed that the direct effect gave the highest 
correlation value among the variables studied compared to the indirect effect. The immediate impact of compensation 
on work discipline has the highest correlation value compared to the impact of other variables. Meanwhile, the lowest 
correlation is shown in the indirect effect of the supervision variable on job satisfaction through work discipline. The 
highest correlation found in this study, namely the direct impact of compensation on work discipline, shows that giving 
high balance and following expectations will create a good level of work discipline. Payment encourages a person to 
work more actively and actively and even exert all his ability to meet organizational expectations. This is what 
encourages health workers in the scope of the Central Mamuju Regency General Hospital to have high work discipline 
behavior because of the high expectation of the value of the compensation given. Meanwhile, the lowest correlation 
shows a mismatch in acting through supervision towards increasing satisfaction through work discipline. Management 
without joy will encourage a good level of discipline, so the influence of this relationship is not considerable but 
positive.

The effect of monitoring on satisfaction is positive. Increased supervision followed by increased satisfaction, assuming 
other factors are considered constant. The study results are in line with the statement (Ernie Tisnawati Sule & 
Saifullah, 2010). One of the keys to understanding how employees can be controlled and supervised is job satisfaction. 
Organizations need to understand and control how employee satisfaction expectations are achieved. The results of the 
study support research (Yunita & Lidia, 2016) that supervision has a significant influence on job satisfaction. Then 
analysis by (Aprilandi et al., 2015), that leadership positively affects job satisfaction. 
The effect of work discipline on job satisfaction is positive. An increase in work discipline is followed by improved 
satisfaction, assuming that other factors are considered constant. This result aligns with the statement (Hasibuan, 2011) 
that satisfaction is a pleasant emotional attitude and likes work. This attitude is reflected through morale, discipline, 
and achievement. The results of the study support research (Riyanto, 2016) that work discipline has a positive effect 
on job satisfaction. Then, research by (Mustofa 2018) states that work discipline has a significant impact on employee 
satisfaction. 
The Effect of Compensation on Job Satisfaction through Work Discipline is positive. This can be seen in the path 
analysis having a positive effect; thus, work discipline can influence compensation on job satisfaction. Balance 
becomes an essential variable in increasing job satisfaction which then has an impact on growing results. The indirect 
effect of payment on job satisfaction through work discipline is shown by several compensation indicators: 
cooperation ties, job satisfaction, motivation, discipline, and employee stability. As a place of research, the Regional 
General Hospital of Central Mamuju Regency demands a high level of joy. The quality and quality of the hospital 
become excellent and reliable. 
The effect of Supervision on Job Satisfaction through Work Discipline is positive. This can be seen in the path analysis 
as having a significant impact; thus, work discipline can influence supervision of job satisfaction. The indirect effect 
of management on job satisfaction through work discipline also shows a positive result, meaning that this influence 
will indirectly impact the work discipline variable. Monitoring indicators include preventive, repressive, internal, and 
external supervision. Preventive supervision as a form of control that prioritizes prevention rather than resistance 
through good management in public services such as hospitals is needed. Many actions can trigger unwanted 
situations, such as the possibility of dissatisfaction among employees. After all, they feel that the division of labor 
unfairness, jealousy, and so on. This preventive measure has a positive value for leaders or subordinates, health 
workers, and patients. Repressive measures are also necessary to maintain existing conditions; this is important to 
maintain stability and the work environment. Likewise, internal and external supervision as a form of internal and 
external leadership encourages creating a conducive atmosphere that can be enjoyed together, not only in the internal 
environment but also externally, including hospital patients as individuals who must receive good supervision. 
Through supervision with mediation, the level of discipline encourages the birth of job satisfaction. 
5. Conclusion
Based on the research results, it can be concluded that the direct effect gives the highest correlation value among the 
variables studied compared to the indirect effect. The immediate impact of compensation on work discipline has the 
highest correlation value compared to the influence of other variables. Meanwhile, the lowest correlation is shown in 
the indirect effect of the supervisory variable on job satisfaction through work discipline. The highest correlation 
found in this study, namely the direct impact of compensation on work discipline, shows that giving high balance and 
their expectations will create a good level of work discipline. Payment encourages a person to work more actively and 
actively and even exert all his abilities to meet the organization's expectations. This is what encourages health workers 
in the scope of the Central Mamuju Regency General Hospital to have high work discipline behavior because of the 
high expectation of the value of the compensation given. At the same time, the lowest correlation indicates a 
discrepancy in terms of acting through supervision of increasing satisfaction through work discipline. Leadership 
without joy will also encourage a good level of discipline, so the influence of this relationship is not significant but 
positive. For the following research, it is necessary to add other variables that may affect the dependent variable.

Abstract 
The research objective was to measure and analyze the influence of health facilities and competence on the quality of 
services through the performance of health workers at the Central Mamuju District General Hospital. This research 
design is a survey. This research was conducted at the Regional General Hospital of Central Mamuju Regency. This 
research lasted for about two months, from July 2019 to August 2019. Data collection was carried out through 
observation, interviews, questionnaires, documentation. The sample in the study was 100 people data analysis through 
research instrument test, validity test, reliability test, and path analysis. The results showed that the direct effect of 
competence on the performance of health workers had the highest correlation value compared to the impact of other 
variables. In contrast, the lowest correlation was shown in the indirect effect of the health facility variable on service 
quality through the performance of health workers. The highest correlation found in this study is the direct result of 
competence in health workers' performance. It shows that competence is the foundation in improving performance 
and even quality service quality. The competence of respondents is measured through the knowledge, skills, personal 
characteristics, and motives of the respondents. Another case with the lowest correlation found in the indirect 
relationship between health facilities and service quality through the performance of health workers shows that not 
always good facilities will guarantee quality and even high performance. Still, it can be ascertained that good 
performance tends to use good quality as well.

1. Introduction
According to Khoeriyah health facilities as public facilities for the community need to increase the level of health that 
can affect regional activities and productivity (Khoeriyah, 2013). The existence of health facilities will have an impact 
on quality health and health conditions in an area. In addition to health facilities that affect service quality, competency 
factors also affect service quality. According to Azwar, 2010 to maintain the quality of health services in hospitals, 
benefits become the competence of qualified health workers and continue to be involved in a hospital quality control 
program (Azwar, 2010). Health workers also affect the quality of service. According to Mathis Robert the quality of

The influence of health facilities on the performance of health workers is positive; this is in line with the statement 
that facilities are infrastructure facilities that facilitate work (Anoraga, 2005). Also, these results support research 
(Hannan et al., 2016) that facilities have a significant positive effect on nurse performance. Furthermore, research by 
(Awaluddin, Alam, & Yusuf, 2011), that facilities have a significant positive impact on employee performance. 
The Effect of Competence on Health Personnel Performance is positive; an increase in competence is followed by an 
increase in performance, assuming other factors are constant. The results of this study are supported by Lasmahadi's 
statement (Prayitno et al., 2002) that competence is a personal aspect of employees that enables them to achieve 
superior performance. These aspects include nature, values, systems, skills, and knowledge. Competence will drive 
behavior while behavior produces performance. (Palan, 2007) revealed that competence drives behavior. This basis is 
evident in how individuals behave in the workplace. Competence concerns people with what they can do, not what 
they can do. Competence lies with those who excel. The results of the study support research (Nita Indrawati, 2017) 
that competence has a significant influence on employee performance. Then, research by (Zulfikar 2016) found that 
competence has a considerable impact on employee performance. 
The influence of health facilities on service quality is positive; improving health facilities is followed by increased 
service quality, assuming other factors are held constant. This result is supported by the statement (Khoeriyah, 2013) 
that health facilities as public facilities for community needs function to increase health levels. The existence of 
infrastructure facilities will have an impact on quality health status. 
The influence of competence on service quality is positive; increasing competence is followed by improving service 
quality, assuming other factors are held constant—implementing quality in hospitals. The results of this study are in 
line with research (Maya Cynthia Rebecca, 2017) (Vika Nafidatul Jannah, 2018) that competence influences service 
quality. 
Health Worker Performance on Service Quality is positive; performance improvement is followed by quality 
improvement, assuming other factors are constant. The study results are supported by the statement (Mathis Robert & 
Jackson John, 2006) that the quality of work is measured through the views/perceptions of employees on the quality 
of work produced. Then, Zeithaml & Berry (Sudarmanto, 2015) stated that reliability includes correct, precise, and 
accurate performance and service. The study results align with research (Surya & Yon, 2018) that influential version 
has a significant influence on service quality. Furthermore, analysis by (Handayani Ekawati, 2013) shows employee 
performance on service quality. 
The influence of health facilities on service quality through the performance of health workers is positive. This can be 
seen in the path analysis of the indirect effect of health facilities by implementing health workers having a significant 
influence on service quality. Thus, the performance of health workers can influence health facilities on service quality. 
Health facilities as a support for health implementation activities significantly impact improving the quality of health 
services. Work facilities intended in this study are work tools, work equipment, and social facilities. 
The influence of competence on service quality through the performance of health workers is a positive competency 
on service quality through the implementation of health workers. Thus, the version of health workers can affect the 
competence of service quality. The indirect effect of competence on service quality through employee performance is 
seen in the level of good knowledge possessed by health workers; knowledge is the primary basis in improving the 
understanding of health workers. Skills are also a support for improving the quality of hospital services through the 
performance of health workers; without good skills, it will be difficult for anyone to carry out their job duties, 
especially tasks or jobs that require high skills. Self-concept and values reflect the personality of a health worker; 
attitudes and discounts will be a reference in measuring how well and capable the person can interact with others. 
Health workers with a good self-concept will foster an attitude of enthusiasm from the patients they serve. 
6. Conclusions
Based on the results of research on the effect of health facilities, competence, and performance of health workers on 
service quality, it can be concluded that all variables show a correlation that influences each other with different levels. 
Among the effects of the variables studied, the direct impact gives the highest correlation value compared to the 
indirect effect. The immediate effect of competence on the performance of health workers has the highest correlation 
value compared to the influence of other variables. Meanwhile, the lowest correlation is shown in the indirect effect 
of the health facility variable on service quality through the performance of health workers. Based on the highest

correlation found in this study, the direct influence of competence on the performance of health workers shows that 
competence is the foundation in improving performance and even quality service quality. This competence of 
respondents is measured through knowledge, skills, personal characteristics, and motives of the respondents.In 
contrast, the lowest correlation found in the indirect relationship between health facilities and service quality through 
the performance of health workers shows that not always good facilities will guarantee quality and even high 
performance. Still, good performance will inevitably result in good quality and reasonable utilization of facilities. For 
further research, it is necessary to add other variables that are certain to influence service quality.

5. Conclusion 
The results of the concrete panel test show the results of 7.000 kg/cm2, 8.000 kg/cm2 and 7.800 kg/cm2. Based on 
these results, it shows that composite concrete panels can be used as part of simple building structures. 
 
In addition, the sand test obtained results for sand humidity of 0.77%, sand absorption in water of 17.9%, the volume 
weight of sand without a joist was 1.56 gr/cm3, with a vibration of 1.76 gr/cm3, with a vibration of 1.71 gr /cm3, 
cleanliness of sand against mud 2.6%. Coarse aggregate test results found that the humidity of crushed stone was 
0.01%, the absorption of crushed stone to water was 2.6%, the volume weight of crushed stone without being jostled 
was 1.49 gr/cm3, with joist gr/cm3, the cleanliness of crushed stone against silt 0.2%, crushed stone specific gravity 
2.22%. The sand used is from the sand of Lumajang City which is adjacent to Mount Semeru 
 
The recommendation that can be given is that when implementing concrete puzzles in the field, skilled workers are 
needed and understand the world of construction techniques so that basic training needs to be held first in making 
galvalum composite panel concrete. 
 
Galvalume composite concrete panels are a relatively recent innovation, so the precision and design of the panels is 
not yet precise/accurate. The use of galvalum as a filler in the manufacture of composite concrete panels needs to be 
proven through a long time test to determine weather resistance and so on.

The advantages are when implementing galvalum composite concrete panels, it can be made outside the field in precast 
form so that work can be carried out at any time and in a different place from the construction site. 
The resulting concrete panels are strong in weight and have been carried out in laboratory tests with good results. 
The resulting panel shape is uniform and has relatively the same quality.

Abstract 
Picking systems are great allies for companies that must manage a wide range of stock keeping units (SKU) and/or 
purchase order (PO) volume. The available systems allow optimization of the most valued resources within a company: 
time and labor; allowing organizations to gain greater competitiveness within their industry. Based on a descriptive and 
comparative scope design, this study focuses on the analysis of three automated simulation cases for order preparation 
systems to analyze its effectiveness within the warehouses: put-to-light, put-to-wall, and routing system. Likewise, it was 
sought to analyze the particularities of the three case studies in order to constitute a support framework for the 
management of the companies during their distribution center improvement process. The findings show that the first two 
simulation cases of the three chosen focus their study on solving makespan problems in picking, while the last case 
specializes in systemic preparations prior to the order preparation process; furthermore, these three selected cases have 
used the Gurobi Optimizer software to carry out the simulation.

1. Introduction
Online shopping, also known as e-commerce, has become very popular due to the rapid development of the internet, even 
more so with the spread of COVID-19, where the social distancing implemented by the governments from different 
countries generated radical changes in life of people. Thus, this growth of information and communication technologies 
(ICT) has been key to replace activities such as face-to-face work with remote work, education with e-learning, purchases 
with e-shopping, among others. (Mouratidis and Papagiannakis, 2021). 
In addition, referring to online purchases, Xuan (2022) considers that, with the progressive advance of ICT, consumers 
have become more demanding in the requirements for products and/or services that they request, because they seek greater 
personalization in them, causing companies to compete with each other using various strategies that require high 
investment to guarantee a level of service superior to their peers, since focusing only on the quality and price of products 
is no longer enough to obtain higher sales. However, these efforts to strengthen services must be balanced with the 
reduction of total logistics costs, in which the preparation of orders (picking) represents an important role. 
Currently, there are multiple warehouses around the world that are constantly studying the possibility of making their 
picking operations more efficient and, as a result, the material handling industry has developed technological tools, such

within the distribution center, the size of the establishment, among others. These scenarios also reflect possible future 
situations that could occur after applying the new automated system in the picking process in order to test its effectiveness 
and efficiency during its simulation stage on the chosen platform. 
 
Finally, for those companies considering the application of an automated picking system it is recommended to perform 
an analysis that considers the exact situation and characteristics of their distribution center, as well as the objectives to be 
achieved by such implementation. Any modification in a warehouse must be feasible in the long term, since these mean 
possible service shutdowns that not every company could be allowed in a recurring or unexpected way.

Abstract 
This study proposes improvements in one of the processes of the operational flow of an electric cable manufacturing 
company with the objective of reducing the environmental impact of its emissions. The improvement focuses on the 
copper annealing sub-process, in relation to the wire drawing operation. Under an experimental design, a diagnosis 
was made of the 2.5 mm diameter wire production process. It was found that it generated unnecessary waste of 
electrical energy in the annealing stage. With the help of a group of experts, the carbon footprint indicator was also 
calculated. The solution implemented consisted of the partial elimination of the primary drawing annealing operation 
and recurring adjustments for the efficient operation of the rest of the process. The benefit of the proposal, validated 
through laboratory tests, was calculated at USD 2.81 per year for each dollar invested. The results show that the wires 
only changed in their mechanical properties, having mainly an elongation of 35%-36% for the soft wire and 2% for 
the hard wire. However, the change in these mechanical properties does not chemically affect the quality of the final 
product thanks to the adjustments made, reducing the carbon footprint by 1444,186 tCO2 per year. This proposal could 
be replicated in similar companies in the metallurgical sector.

1. Introduction
Climate change has been present as a process related to a group of manifestations over time causing a variation in the 
parameters established for the climate during annual temperature periods, precipitations and atmospheric movements 
(Cordova, 2020). This climate variation is mainly produced by Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs) as a result of the 
inefficient use of natural resources. This is causing manufacturing companies to actively seek solutions regarding 
these types of gasses emissions, misuse of electrical energy and resources within industrial processes.  
In the past years, tools have been developed for GHGs management, one of them being the carbon footprint associated 
with organizations, permitting the quantification of these directly or indirectly generated emissions by the company’s 
activities (Nuñez, 2012). This tool has been progressively gaining relevance due to clients’ demand, and as well as the

Table 6 shows the results of the tests carried out on the soft copper wire samples. It shows an elongation between 35-
36% and a relatively low tensile strength at break, proving that it is a soft copper wire. In turn, Table 7 shows a 
minimum elongation between 2-2.5% and a high tensile strength at break, proving that it is a hard copper wire. In 
spite of this variation in the mechanical properties of the copper wire, its use in the following processes is developed 
without any problem because its chemical composition does not vary and the hard material would be annealed in the 
second drawing and returned to its soft physical state, preserving its conductive properties. 
 
4. Discussion 
The improvement was implemented by making modifications to the annealing machine, obtaining as an economic 
result the cost-benefit of 2.81 USD for each Dollar invested. By having a positive indicator, it was justified that the 
improvement proposal could be beneficial for the company thanks to the energy savings implied by the reduction of 
the carbon footprint diagnosed in the initial section by mitigating 1.44 Mt of CO2eq per year.  
 
In a study that applied cumulative energy demand modeling in an aluminum extrusion plant by adapting its 
improvements within the production process, it achieved a significant decrease in energy costs. It had a 10% reduction 
in waste from the extrusion process that could save the North American extrusion industry between 270 and 311 
million dollars per year, in addition to avoiding the emission of between 0.5 and 2.3 Mt of CO2eq per year (Oberhausen 
et al., 2022). Thus, by making modifications or improvements within the initial annealing process, similar results to 
the previously mentioned cases could be achieved.  
 
From the Technical point of view, in many cases temperature plays an important role in the drawing process. However, 
for this research it was not considered as a variable because if this variable was used and these values were altered, 
the entire drawing method and equipment would have to be changed. A modification of the model implemented by 
engineer Avitzur is usually presented. This model can help select the process parameters that satisfy the minimum 
drawing tension conditions for copper material using the temperature in a drawing machine that uses a different 
method (Haddi et al., 2022).  
 
Likewise, the scope of the study could be expanded to all processes to identify their environmental impacts also with 
the use of the carbon footprint. This was also used in textile and metallurgy companies, among others, where different 
areas of the company make the necessary changes to mitigate these impacts or else, by hiring third parties to perform 
these tasks. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The implementation of the improvement proposal achieved the main objective of the research by reducing electricity 
consumption related to the company's carbon footprint during the annealing process. Furthermore, by applying 
industrial engineering tools in the implementation design, an economic saving was achieved, which was measured 
through the cost-benefit indicator, obtaining 2.81 USD, supporting the feasibility and being attractive for professionals 
and/or researchers who wish to replicate or improve the developed proposal.

By comparing the results obtained with those of other studies on carbon footprint reduction, the optimal economic and 
environmental benefits of optimizing energy use in different industries could be verified. 
 
As a recommendation, an exhaustive study should be made of the different operations within the process to determine 
potential critical points in terms of energy savings. The limitation within the research is the lack of the com 
panies’ authorities' willingness to change because the previous work method has been the easiest method to develop. 
However, by not analyzing in depth the environmental aspects and impacts, they are not aware that simple 
improvements can be made within the process that end up being beneficial in many aspects not only for a single 
company, but in general to many industries in the sector and the country.

Abstract 
The situation of the restaurants sector in Peru, since the COVID-19 pandemic, has varied in comparison to the rise 
that was expected in the sector before the sanitary crisis. Due to the massive contagions and the uncontrollable nature 
of the disease, government regulations were implemented, and the process of adjusting to the protocols for serving the 
public took time, affecting the progress of businesses in this area. This study focuses on this problem with the objective 
of identifying the most determining factors to promote the development and growth of the restaurant sector, in a stage 
that some call the new normality. To this end, a compilation of documents related to the subject was carried out and 
two rounds of open interviews were conducted with the participation of seven experts on the subject.  Thereafter, the 
factors were identified and ranked according to their level of mobility and dependence in a matrix of impacts with the 
help of MICMAC software (Matrix of Cross Impacts Multiplication Applied to a Classification). The findings of the 
study show that the most influential factors of the system are compliance with the required protocols, reinforcement 
of the delivery service and training in hygiene and disinfection. These results serve as a basis for planning possible 
scenarios aimed at the future development of the sector, as well as local strategies that can be transferred to other 
contexts in the region.

1. Introduction
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is still present in the world, the new coronavirus detected in December 2019, 
called SARS-CoV-2, and its variations are continuing to spread. Given the characteristics of this health crisis, the 
World Health Organization (WHO, 2020) and the health institutions of the respective governments, took actions to 
control - in some way - massive contagions and deadly consequences. The recommendations, since the first days, 
included travel restrictions, social distancing and strict protocols on public attention. In this context, restaurants were 
closed as a necessary measure in the interest of public health, resulting in negative effects on the restaurant sector, as 
well as on different sectors of the economy. 
In fact, the situation of the restaurant sector in Peru, before the pandemic, was on the rise, with positive growth; 
however, after government regulations and measures were implemented, the progress of businesses in this sector 
changed. Services that were already flourishing in the last decades are forced to change their approach, facing new 
challenges with the recession caused by the coronavirus (Lakshmi and Shareena 2020). According to figures from 
Passport Euromonitor International (2021), consumer sales in the restaurant sector in Peru were increasing every year; 
however, from 2019 to 2020 they decreased by 48% and from 2020 to March 2021 they decreased by 29%. A reality 
that shows the reduction in sales revenue for this sector of the country's economy. 
Also, the unemployment rate, due to the sanitary emergency, has increased; in recent years it has moved from an 
unemployment rate of 7.8% in March 2020 to 15.3% in March 2021 (Banco Central de Reserva Del Perú 2021). As a 
consequence of the quarantine periods in which many establishments had to close their doors or were forced to reduce 
staff. 
Furthermore, most sectors are facing new cost categories, such as greater control of employees, extra shifts, safety 
practices and sanitation (Hailu 2020). This means that the environment is not favorable for the development of this

because it minimizes the contact between customers and restaurant employees and allows customers to enjoy their 
favorite restaurant food at home, thereby giving the restaurant industry, which has been severely hurt, another chance 
to thrive and evolve (Hong et al. 2021). This is proven by a study that through regression functions to differentiate the 
personal characteristics of customers who used the delivery service, determines that customers who purchased food 
by delivery were linked with lower observed perceived threat (Mehrolia et al. 2020). Therefore, it is worth noting that 
boosting the delivery service (F4), which also influences the performance of novel, well-thought-out activities for 
businesses in this sector to initiate and continue providing their services will be the first step towards the reactivation 
of the restaurants. 
6. Conclusion
Different factors affecting the restaurant sector in Peru as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. 
After analysis, the results show that factors 3, 4 and 6 (compliance with required protocols, reinforcement of delivery 
service and training in hygiene and disinfection) are the most representative of the conflict area (upper right quadrant). 
This makes them the most important factors for the restaurant sector in the sanitary situation and should be considered 
by the managers of these businesses in order to act on them strategically. To a lesser extent, factors 5, 10, 11 
(innovation in the face of the pandemic, financial concerns and increased customer confidence), also located in the 
conflict area, should be recognized by the sector for their evolution. Therefore, with a high number of factors in the 
conflict area, more than 50% of the total number of factors, which generate a high degree of mobility and dependence, 
it follows that the map of influences and dependencies presents an unstable system. In this scenario, any decision on 
one of the factors has repercussions on all the others and turns back on itself.  
Therefore, the main factors that influence the improvement of the operations of several restaurants in pandemic are 
identified, as well as the less influential factors for the recovery of these businesses.  
Finally, the identification of factors aims at establishing elements of judgment for a strategic planning of future 
scenarios, leading to an eventual prospective analysis oriented to the development of the restaurant sector in the studied 
context, which can be transferred to other scenarios in the region.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to discuss the forms, the factors and the implications of adaptation of Muhammadiyah 
members to the religious tradition of Nahdlatul Ulama. Robert K. Merton's theory was used to see the adaptation 
process which has been carried out by Muhammadiyah members in Gorontalo. The study applied a 
phenomenological qualitative approach. In the process of collecting data, the study used observation and interview 
techniques. The data analysis classified the data including primary and secondary data. The results showed that the 
adaptation of Muhammadiyah members was in the form of implementing the religious tradition of Nahdlatul Ulama. 
They were: mongaruwa (spirit prayer), molibungo (female circumcision), and be'ati (oath of allegiance). The factors 
that caused the adaptation of Muhammadiyah members were the process of collaboration, and continuously mutual 
openness with Nahdlatul Ulama members in the community. In addition, the implications of the adaptation: first, 
there was a harmonious social life among Muslims. Lastly, Muhammadiyah members were not rigid in the midst of 
the religious traditions of the Nahdlatul Ulama members and the local traditions of Gorontalo.

1. Introduction
Nahdlatul Ulama has a traditional character which can be found in the cultural spaces of the Gorontalo community. 
When you find Qadhi (a leader of priests), Imamu (a priest), Kasisi (a village priest) who leads the religious 
ceremonies or Hulango (traditional shaman), Baate (the head of tradition), Hu'u (the representative of tradition), and 
Mayulu (security) who lead various traditional activities. Gorontalonese easily refer them to Nahdlatul Ulama 
members. This religious organization has become a symbol of a cultural group (Eka Octalia Indah Librianti 2019). 
Meanwhile, Muhammadiyah members have a modern character who are known to be strong with the spirit of 
seeking and purifying Islam; it turns out that they have succeeded in finding a social position in Gorontalo 
community which is thick with the traditional nuances (Muhammad Dachlan 2017). This position aims for a 
balanced social structure and emphasizes the stability, unity and harmony of the social system (Robert K. Merton 
2015). 
The study of the adaptation of Muhammadiyah members to the religious tradition of Nahdlatul Ulama Gorontalo 
showed two things. First, the study of Islamic thought of Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama. The first-mentioned 
Islamic organization is based more on an urban-based society, genealogically. Therefore, the basis of thought and 
movement is labeled modernist. Meanwhile, the last-mentioned Islamic group, Nahdlatul Ulama, is a group that was

There is a dominant factor why conflicts are not ignited, even though the opportunities and potentials are wide open 
as experienced by other regions. The factor is none other than the Muslim community of Gorontalo conformed by 
their environment. There are also those who are not aware that they have come out of the early ideology that they 
firmly hold. Generally, the social setting has made them follow the rules of the environment in which they live. 
Sometimes, there are also those who are aware, but still follow the rules that apply in their social space rather than 
being ostracized by other groups. Thus, the only way is to secure themselves. If a Muhammadiyah person lives in 
the midst of the NU majority, inevitably, he or she must participate in carrying out the NU tradition, and vice versa. 
Safri Mardison (2013: 79) analyzes this problem in a social context, that the results of interactions among people 
usually lead everyone to tend to avoid conflict and choose a comfort zone. The sense of safety and comfort that a 
person gets is a way for him to survive in a group. 
 
6.  Conclusions  
Muhammadiyah members still exist carrying Islamic modernism and puritanism, even though they are in the midst 
of traditional society. Their (da'wah) religious proselytizing strategy is to implement social adaptation in the midst 
of the Nahdlatul Ulama Muslim community. The goal is to survive and be accepted in developing a progressive 
Islamic mission. The form of adaptation that they do is carrying out the religious traditions of Nahdlatul Ulama such 
as tahlilan, yasinan, maulidan, and other traditions. This factor is influenced by community members who are open 
to each other, including Muhammadiyah members, so as to create a free, open and fluid atmosphere. Geographical 
proximity makes the two organizations open to each other. Because Gorontaloness are in urban areas, especially in 
rural areas, they will be judged to deviate from customs; if they close themselves off from other people. The other 
factor in the form of collaboration among the Gorontalo Muslims community, especially those with Muhammadiyah 
and Nahdlatul Ulama backgrounds, always occurs, both at the elite level in the organizational structure and in the 
midst of ordinary people. Meanwhile, the implication of the adaptation of Muhammadiyah members is to create a 
harmonious and humanistic atmosphere in socio-religious life. 
 
7.   Acknowledgments  
The researcher would like to thank the administrators and members of Muhammadiyah who have shared the 
information. It was about their attitudes in the midst of the religious tradition of Nahdlatul Ulama. He is also 
extremely grateful to Prof. Irwan Abdullah through the IA Schoolar Foundation who has guided him in writing this 
article. We greatly appreciate the APSSI Conference Committee.

The beta coefficient of the role of knowledge (x1) on immunization coverage (y2) 0.143. with an SE value of 0.039 
at the level of 0.003. That the part of knowledge (x1) influences immunization coverage (y2), the statistical value of 
the role of knowledge (x1) on immunization coverage (y2) was 0.143 with a significance of 0.003 below 0.05, meaning 
that the part of knowledge had a significant positive effect on immunization coverage. The fourth hypothesis that the 
role of knowledge influences immunization coverage was proven. The beta coefficient of Nursing Service Quality 
(x2) on immunization coverage (y2) was 0.164, with an SE value of 0.057 at the level of 0.003. The quality of nursing 
services (x2) has a positive influence on immunization coverage (y2). The statistical value of nursing service quality 
(x2) on immunization coverage (y2) was 0.164 with a significance of 0.003 below 0.05. The quality of nursing services 
had a significant positive effect on immunization coverage. The fifth hypothesis that the quality of nursing services at 
the Lara Public Health Center influences immunization coverage. 
 
4.7. Indirect Influence 
According to the results of the Sobel test, the calculated t value of the role of knowledge (x1) on immunization 
coverage (y2) through community responses (y1) is 4.954, and the larger t-table is 1.653. Thus, the sixth hypothesis 
that the role of knowledge has a significant positive effect on immunization coverage through community responses 
at the Lara Public Health Center is proven. According to the results of the Sobel test, the calculated t value of nursing 
service satisfaction (x2) on immunization coverage (y2) through community responses (y1) is 8,750. It is more 
significant than t-table worth 1,653. Thus, the seventh hypothesis that the quality of nursing services has a significant 
positive effect on immunization coverage through community responses at the Lara Public Health Center is proven. 
 
5. Discussion 
Based on the views and assessments. Of the respondents on the role of knowledge obtained through the results of the 
questionnaire. It shows that the part of knowledge in the sixth indicator is in the high category. Namely, the age factor 
has a vital role for the community to understand better the immunizations given to them. Meanwhile, based on the 
formulation of the problem that has been described previously. From the results of hypothesis testing with path 
analysis of the path coefficient model I., it was found that there was a significant positive effect between the knowledge 
role variables on community responses. In the Work Area of the Lara Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central 
Mamuju. In the path analysis model results, I obtained the value of knowledge X1 = 0.257 with a probability level, 
the part of knowledge was 0.000 (p < 0.05). With this, the first hypothesis that the writer proposes can be accepted. 
There is a positive and significant effect between the knowledge variables on the community response in the Work 
Area of the Lara Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju. 
 
From the results of data processing on the respondents' answers, it was found that the service satisfaction variable to 
the community response in the Lara Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju was in a pretty good 
category. Therefore, the hypothesis that the author proposes shows a significant positive effect between the satisfaction 
of nursing services on the response of the community in the work area of the Lara Public Health Center, Karossa 
District, Central Mamuju. This is obtained from the path analysis test results (Path Analysis) path coefficient model. 
I obtained the value of service satisfaction X2 = 0.710 with a probability level (sig) motivation is 0.000 (p <0.05). The 
results of the path analysis test prove that the hypothesis proposed by the author is accepted, namely that there is a 
significant positive effect between nursing service satisfaction and community response in the Lara Public Health 
Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju. The correlation number is positive, which means that if service satisfaction 
increases by one point, the community response in the Lara Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju 
will increase. 
 
Based on the direct test results with the Path Analysis test, the authors conclude that the community response shows 
a significant positive effect on the coverage area of the Lara Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju. 
The results of the path analysis test (Path Analysis) path coefficient model II obtained a community response value of 
Y1 = 0.651 with a probability level (sig) of community response is 0.000 (p < 0.05). The results of the Path Analysis 
test prove that the hypothesis proposed by the author is accepted because there is a positive and significant influence 
between the community's response to the coverage area of the Lara Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central 
Mamuju. This shows that the good or bad of the community's response is influenced by the low level of community 
satisfaction with the services provided well.

Abstract 
This study analyzes the model of the influence of competence and innovation on employee performance mediated by 
compensation variables in the scope of the Development Planning Agency at Sub-National Level (BAPPEDA) 
Bulukumba Regency. Primary data collection using a questionnaire. The statement used can be declared valid if the 
correlation value (r) exceeds 0.3. Cronbach Alpha test is used to test the level of reliability (reliability) of each variable. 
If the Cronbach alpha value is getting closer to 1, it indicates that the consistency of reliability is also higher. Data 
analysis was performed using SPSS with stratified regression analysis. This requirement is used to determine the 
correlation between the independent variables, namely competence (X1) and innovation (X2) on employee 
performance (Y2) which is mediated by the compensation variable (Y1). This research was conducted at BAPPEDA 
Bulukumba Regency for five months. The data source in this research is secondary data from information on the object 
of research, scientific journals, and books related to research variables, and primary data obtained directly from 
respondents or the samples in this study. Data analysis used a path analysis. The results showed that: 1) Competence 
has a positive and significant effect on compensation; 2) Innovation has a positive and significant effect on 
compensation; 3) Competence has a positive and significant effect on performance; 4) Innovation has a positive and 
significant effect on performance; 5) Compensation has a positive and significant effect on performance; 6) 
Competence has a positive and significant effect on performance through compensation; and 7) Innovation has a 
positive and significant effect on performance through compensation.

Research by Putra and Aji showed a significant positive effect between competence on compensation (Putra, 2016; 
Aji et al. 2017). Further investigation by Rasyid found that balance has a positive and significant impact on employee 
performance (Rasyid et al. 2018). So, it can be said that competence has a positive and significant effect on 
performance mediated by compensation. So that in this research, the H6 and H7 are accepted. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The study results prove that competence and innovation have a significant effect on employee compensation and 
performance. Competence increases employee compensation, especially the value of the benefits provided, especially 
in the mastery of task completion techniques, in-depth knowledge of tasks, and ability to carry out tasks. Furthermore, 
compensation will be a driving force for employees to improve their performance, as seen by the high work 
commitment, independence, and high work quality as characteristics of improving employee performance.

Abstract 
This study aims to measure and analyze the effect of locus of control and competence on medical and paramedical 
functional performance through motivation at the Maros Veterinary Center (BBVet Maros). This study used a 
quantitative approach with a research design, namely an explanatory survey. Sampling was carried out by saturated 
sampling technique with a total sample of 116 functional medical and paramedical employees of BBVet Maros. The 
analytical tool used is path analysis to determine the direct and indirect effect on the variables studied. Based on the 
data analysis, the research results show that locus of control and competence, and motivation positively and 
significantly affect the Maros Veterinary Center's performance. So those employees are expected to develop locus of 
control inside or outside themselves, increase motivation from within employees through challenges at work, and 
support from superiors through objective promotions and employee placement according to their areas of expertise to 
improve employee performance at BBVet Maros. 
Keywords 
Locus of Control, Competence, Motivation, and Performance. 
1. Introduction
Entering the era of globalization, which is full of challenges, a government agency must have a strong foundation and 
innovation. Human resources (HR) are one of the critical factors that determine the success of the agency. Quality 
human resources will be able to face all the global challenges that will arise. Therefore, a directed and planned HR 
management strategy is needed to produce human resources committed and perform well to carry out every task that 
is their responsibility in the organization and overcome problems that may be encountered while carrying out these 
tasks. This is related to applying the science of HR management policy which examines various organizational 
behavior factors on performance which is called the science of organizational behavior.

The results of this study are in line with the theory of Wibowo, explaining that two main factors influence motivation, 
namely the first factor of employees consisting of abilities, knowledge, character and characteristics, emotions, moods, 
beliefs, and beliefs values. The second factor of work includes the physical environment, asSigned tasks, the 
organization's approach to superior recognition and recognition, supervision, guidance, and organizational culture. 
Thus, behavioral motivation is directly influenced by knowledge, abilities, and skills. This is supported by empirical 
research from Nilam that competence on work motivation Significantly affects. So, it can be concluded that 
competence has a positive effect on work motivation. 
 
5.3. The Influence of Locus of Control on Employee Performance Through Motivation 
Testing the sixth hypothesis shows that the locus of control strongly influences employee performance through 
motivation at the Maros Veterinary Center; the Significance value of Sig indicates this. 0.000 < 0.05. So, it can be 
said that the locus of control has a positive and significant effect on performance through motivation at the Maros 
Veterinary Center. This study implies that empirical findings show that the locus of control must be further improved 
to improve performance through motivation, i.e., the employee must determine that his own control causes events, 
occurrences, and destiny. This shows that the higher the locus of control, the more motivation will increase, which 
will impact performance. 
 
Wahyosumidjo states that motivation as a process that arises from factors from within a person himself is called 
intrinsic, and factors outside of a person are called extrinsic. With great encouragement or motivation for every 
employee who works at the Maros Veterinary Center. Max can direct their attitudes and actions from the various 
individual goals they have so that they are willing to put aside their personal goals and can work well, effectively, 
efficiently, and effectively. They have high achievements for the institution.

Cross-Sector Coordination of Village Community Social 
Institutions and Agricultural Intensification 
to Support Food Independence

Abstract 
In rural studies, the themes of rural community social institutions, agricultural intensification, and food self-
sufficiency are interesting studies. Coordination of village community social institutions is still weak. The agricultural 
intensification system is still experiencing problems. Food independence is still vulnerable. The purpose of this study 
is to analyze the coordination of village community social institutions, and the intensification of agriculture to support 
food self-sufficiency. The study from the perspective of rural sociology was carried out in 4 villages, namely 
Plawangan, Kertawinangun, Soge, and Ilir, Indramayu Regency, in 2021. The four villages are downstream areas with 
semi-technical, rain-fed, and irrigated downstream areas. This research method is qualitative. Collecting data through 
field observations, documents, interviews, and focus group discussions. Data analysis by triangulation. The results 
showed that the coordination of village community social institutions was able to control irrigation water to farmers' 
fields, with a shifting system. Crop failure (puso) due to flooding or lack of irrigation water can be overcome. 
Agricultural intensification can work, and can increase crop productivity by around 6 to 7 tons of grain per ha per 
growing season. Agricultural intensification is able to support food self-sufficiency for the region concerned.

1. Introduction
Rural livelihood is an interesting theme in socio-economic studies of rural communities. Moreover, Indonesia which 
incidentally is still dominated by agricultural areas, the study of rural community social institutions, agricultural 
intensification, and food self-sufficiency is an important and urgent rural study. Weak social institutional coordination 
of rural communities is an obstacle in agricultural intensification. In fact, agricultural intensification in Indonesia has 
developed since the New Order around 1980 until the present post-reform (2021). Even Indonesia during the New 
Order era was successful in food self-sufficiency. However, until 2021 Indonesia will still import rice. Therefore, this 
study would like to present an analysis of cross-sectoral coordination of village community social institutions, 
agricultural intensification and food self-sufficiency. The research locations were carried out in 4 (four) villages, 
namely Plawangan, Kertawinangun, Soge, and Ilir, Indramayu Regency, West Java, in 2021. Cross-sectoral 
coordination of village community social institutions in carrying out agricultural intensification requires 
strengthening. Intensification of lowland rice farming is related to various parties. The linkage is not only between 
fellow farmers, but also between farmers and the social institutions of the village community. The linkage in the 
intensification of lowland rice begins with determining cropping patterns, determining the planting period, tillage, 
selecting seeds, seeding, irrigating or irrigating, fertilizing, eradicating pests, diseases, harvesting, post-harvesting, 
and marketing. 
The whole process, the stages of intensification of lowland rice farming requires cross-sectoral coordination with 
various related parties. Failure to coordinate at one stage can be fatal, hampering other stages of rice farming activities. 
In essence, the failure of cross-sectoral coordination can have an impact on productivity, so that the rice harvest 
produced is not optimal, even crop failure can occur. The three aspects to be studied are cross-sector coordination of 
village community social institutions, agricultural intensification, and food self-sufficiency is part of the development 
of the results of a qualitative research that has been carried out by the author in 2021, entitled: Puso Disaster Mitigation 
and Social Change of Farming Communities. Assessment of cross-sectoral coordination of village community social 
institutions is focused on coordination between village institutions, sub-district agencies, agricultural agencies,

possible, its handling needs to involve various related parties, so that the rice harvest can be successful. The findings 
state that household access to food availability can be said to be not experiencing difficulties because rice commodities 
in the market are quite available (informan KoKdh). This condition should be maintained, so that household and 
community access to food availability is always easy. The findings indicate that the affordability of the community to 
food commodities can be said to be quite difficult. The price of rice in the market is quite high, while when farmers 
sell their rice harvest, they are priced below standard (informan KPlw, KKtw, KSg, and KIr). To overcome this, the 
government, such as BULOG, needs to play an active role in stabilizing the prices of food commodities, including 
rice. Market operations by distributing food to all regions proportionally need to be carried out, so that people can buy 
food at affordable prices. 
 
Regional food independence, even national food independence, must be fulfilled independently by empowering all 
human capital, social capital, and economic capital owned by Indonesian farmers (Rahmawati, 2012). In this case, 
human capital is the ability and skills possessed by all agricultural actors to manage agricultural resources. These 
agricultural actors include farmers, farmer groups, Agricultural Extension Center, Agriculture Service, Irrigation 
Agency, and Cai Partners. Empowerment is carried out through coordination of these agricultural actors with village 
officials, sub-district officials, and security officers. This coordination is needed in order to overcome every problem 
in the ins and outs of farming faced by farmers. Empowerment of all human capital is important so that farmers can 
improve their social and economic life. Social capital is the glue of community diversity. Social capital binds the 
social relations of all farming communities (Fukuyama, 2000). These social ties are established through elements of 
social capital, such as local wisdom, values, mutual cooperation, trust, and social networks. These elements of social 
capital appear to be a force in facing farmers' food self-sufficiency efforts. Strengthening social capital can be formed 
through coordination of village community social institutions. Economic capital includes increasing agricultural 
productivity through intensification, diversification and extensification of agriculture. 
 
Food is food or drink for human consumption sourced from agricultural, plantation, forestry, animal husbandry, 
fishery, water and water products that have been processed or not. The definition of food also includes food raw 
materials, food additives, and other materials used in the process of preparing, processing, and making food or 
beverages for human consumption. In the context of this research, the definition of food is focused on food sourced 
from the production of farmers who are sourced from lowland rice farming, and the diversification of the food crops 
they cultivate. Each household always tries to meet its food needs through various means, such as own business, by 
producing food crops or buying food according to their needs. Farmers are actually food producers who in their lives 
also need food. If farmers can meet their own food needs, it means that the farming household already has food 
independence, and vice versa. 
 
Food independence for a farming household is strongly influenced by food production from its farming business 
(Mulyo, 2015). Farming activities cannot get maximum results if the cultivated land is included in the edge area. This 
situation has an impact on the state of food security of farm households living in the downstream area, the final estuary 
of irrigation canals for agricultural land. This happened in the research location, namely in the villages of Plawangan, 
Kertawinangun, Soge and Ilir, Indramayu district. Dependence on food from imports and the inability to achieve food 
self-sufficiency can cause national security to be disrupted. The agricultural sector has a very strategic role in 
supporting food independence, it is from the agricultural sector that the most basic human needs can be met. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Based on the results of the discussion, it can be concluded as follows; Cross-sectoral coordination between village 
community social institutions, which is carried out synergistically involving village institutions, sub-district agencies, 
agricultural agencies, irrigation agencies, and security agencies can guard the entry of irrigation water into farmers' 
fields, with a rotating system. Cross-sectoral coordination between village community social institutions is able to 
strengthen the role of village community social institutions. Cross-sectoral coordination between local government 
and village community social institutions is able to overcome puso risk. Cross-sectoral coordination between the local 
government and the social institutions of the village community is the supporting capacity for carrying out agricultural 
intensification. The cause of crop failure (puso) is due to lack of irrigation water supply or due to flooding caused by 
high rainfall. The problems of flooding and drought can be overcome, through cross-sectoral coordination between 
the local government and the social institutions of the village community. The rotational irrigation system, which 
usually occurs during the gadu (sadon) season, is able to reduce conflicts over irrigation water struggles between 
farming communities; Agricultural intensification is able to increase crop productivity by around 6-7 tons of unhulled 
rice per hectare per growing season. Intensification of lowland rice farming can continue by implementing the Sapta

Farming Business. Sapta farming is a reference in rice farming for farming communities. Sapta farming management 
is carried out dynamically and sustainably. Constraints in the management of Sapta Farming can be overcome through 
the cooperation of all local government agencies together with related community social institutions. Intensification 
of agriculture becomes the carrying capacity of food security (rice) for the region; Cross-sectoral coordination between 
village community social institutions, and agricultural intensification can increase agricultural productivity. 
Agricultural productivity supports food self-sufficiency. Thus, crop productivity supports food availability for 
households, good food quality, food sufficiency for households, household access to food availability, and public 
affordability of food commodity prices.

Abstract 
This paper aims to find a positive form of practice that the political elite practices at the time of the election. The 
process of social interaction that shapes individual behavior in politics is also a means of political elites supporting 
interests. The study tries to find a form of political strategy that political elites can use to create an agreement. The 
relationship between the public as voters and the political elite certainly gave rise to many models of social exchange. 
To minimize the bad image of politics, the author seeks to explain the positive procession of social interactions born 
from both sides. The method used by the author with a qualitative approach was sourced from secondary data in the 
form of books and journals. This paper reveals that positive values can be formed in a political contest. The interaction 
of political elites gives birth to relationships and social networks that can be used as a tool of support. The behavior 
of the political elite closely related to negative imagery indicates stigmatization carried out by the lay community. In 
the end, the author found a storyline related to the compromises made by the political elite, namely as a means of 
mitigating conflict, the process of interaction that gave birth to the agreement, alternative politics to the strengthening 
of networks for the politics of sustainability. Furthermore, compromise can be seen as behavior that is beneficial to 
the public interest and politics can be interpreted as a form of the common good.

1. Introduction
The process of democratization shows that the success of elections in Indonesia has gone well. History states that this 
democratic process gave rise to good institutions that could function according to the needs of the state (Zuhro,2019) 
However, this picture is equally important in a democracy to determine the successes and failures in which the 
democratic process takes place. The behavior that occurs in the democratization process creates a political culture in 
each of these institutions. This culture forms a habitual attitude of action and values in believing that this behavior is 
carried out to direct society and the political elite (Prasetiyo, 2015)  
When there is a contradictory debate between directing the community and the political elite, the democratic process 
cannot run smoothly, all of which must be supported by democratic institutions to be able to develop capabilities 
credibly so that they can be recognized by the public. This action shows that the credibility of the institution represents 
the interests of society (Sarbaini,2015). The main condition in the democratization process should guarantee the work 
and performance of state institutions in a democratic manner, even though there are some that are not sustainable with 
the interests of the community. All this happens because political culture can create public distrust of the institutional 
capacity (Arianto, 2019).  
Public trust is a real picture of the democratic process when political elites ask to be elected to represent their chosen 
regions. This shows that elite electability is an action based on public trust, complementing and fulfilling one another 
(Asrorin,2020). This condition is in fact strong enough. The community as constituents understands that the interests 
of the political elite in efforts to create democratization through the election process are part of the political interests 
themselves (Juanamasta et al. 2019; Hentihu et al. 2021). Therefore, the behavior that occurs is part of the democratic

anyone the political elite can participate in broader political interests. 
5. Conclusion
The social interaction of political elites to build voter networks raises an understanding of positive strategies that can 
be used in the social exchange process in political contestation. One of these efforts is to use compromise as an 
exchange strategy. Compromise is a virtue for lobbying and negotiations carried out by the political elite. This action 
is supported by the communication skills of the political elite to find an analysis of the form of the vision and mission 
they will make. A good compromise and in accordance with the needs of the community as voters, in fact, can have 
an impact on the acquisition of significant votes. This behavior is a form of contesting elite long-term political 
intelligence. As a means of reducing conflicts of interest, compromise is the middle way to formulate a collective 
agreement. The actions of the political elite who prioritize positive communication through compromise also create 
political trust by the public as voters. Trust built on the basis of social exchange does not always correspond to nominal 
value. The behavior of the political elite maximizes the needs of the community to replace financial capital. 
Compromise merely reduces the pragmatic political attitudes and incapacity of the political elite. Therefore, 
compromise can be categorized as an attempt by the political elite to establish personal closeness both during the 
election process and until the elite will take office. Because what must be done by political elites when they have 
power must continue to build their voter network so that the election process does not require expensive political costs 
and negative actions that can damage democracy.

Abstract 
The Covid 19 pandemic has an impact on all levels of society in Bangka Belitung . The Situation give impact on 
Social, Economic and Cultural conditions. The community also has different reactions in dealing with the pandemic 
situation, which has an impact on the socio-cultural aspects of the community. One of the people who have local 
wisdom in Bangka Belitunga is the Mapur ethnic. The Mapur ethnic is a representative of the Malay community in 
Bangka Belitung. This study aims to explore the process of negotiating the cultural identity of the Mapur community 
resilience the Covid 19 pandemic situation. The negotiation of cultural identity can be seen from the meaning of the 
Mapur Tribe to the Covid 19 pandemic which appears as a symbol that intersects experiencing friction and interplay 
with the local wisdom of the tribe. The location of this research is in Belinyu District which is the location where the 
Mapur Tribe lives. The method used in this study is a qualitative method with a phenomenological research approach. 
Data was collected using non-participant observation techniques and in-depth interviews.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is one of the countries that is predicted to experience a pandemic period that will take a long time (Nugraha 
2020). The vast country, different geography and topography and the level of population density spread over several 
large islands, are challenges in overcoming the pandemic. Remote, outermost, and underdeveloped areas also have a 
great risk when exposed to outbreaks, due to the difficulty of accessing health services in these areas.  
One of the vulnerable groups that have begun to be exposed to the pandemic is the indigenous people. Indigenous 
peoples who were originally considered safe from the pandemic began to report cases and fatalities (Arif 2021). The 
more open their access to the outside world, the more vulnerable they are from exposure to the plague. This condition 
encourages the government to implement a vaccination policy for vulnerable groups including indigenous peoples. 
Indigenous peoples responded differently to this vaccination policy. Masyarakat adat Badui refused vaccine, even 
though the traditional leader has been vaccinated twice. dan memastikan Suku Badui menutup sementara wilayah 
adatnya dari orang luar guna menjaga dari ancaman wabah (Raharjo and Aranditio 2021). Even though indigenous 
Badui refuse to be vaccinated, but they still try to use traditional medicine and mantras to protect and protect 
themselves. In contrast to the Baduy indigenous peoples, the indigenous Makekal Hulu, Merangin, Jambi and 
Rambang Kapak Tengah indigenous peoples, Muara Enim, South Sumatra, these indigenous people tend to receive 
vaccinations, but are constrained by limited access to vaccines (Diana et al. 2021). In addition, the problem of the 
population identification number (NIK) as a vaccination requirement and the lack of socialization about vaccines to 
indigenous peoples are obstacles to accelerating the vaccination program. Along with the significant increase in 
positive cases of COVID-19 in indigenous communities, especially in Aru Kayau, North Kalimantan, Tana Toraja, 
South Sulawesi, Sigi, Central Sulawesi, indigenous peoples need to be protected so that they remain empowered to 
maintain biodiversity and food storage by accelerating access to vaccination programs.

The internal problems of the Mapur indigenous community that have arisen are related to the conflict due to PT GPL's 
corporate policy that accommodates some indigenous people as members of the oil palm smallholder cooperative 
which triggers jealousy and inequality among indigenous people. The consequence of being a member of the plasma 
smallholders is receiving cash of IDR 500,000 per month/family through a bank account. This gap can be reduced 
relatively by the presence of PT Timah Tbk's CSR program and is able to re-knit social cohesion among indigenous 
people. 
 
How do poor people deal with distractions or pressures? With the synergy of traditional elders and youth, they 
established the Air Abik Mapur Customary Institution (LAM) in 2019 by taking advantage of the momentum of the 
annual Nujuh Jerami traditional party which was packaged into the Mapur Festival and an event for recognition of 
population identity as believers. The Mapur Festival was attended by the Regent of Bangka and the Head of Malay 
Customs (LAM) of Bangka as well as the inauguration of the LAM Air Abik board  and the symbolic handing over 
of family cards (KK) and Identity Cards (KTP) for adherents of the faith  
 
6. Conclusions 
The indigenous Mapur community in Air Abik has experienced various disturbances, both to their livelihoods and 
their lives as a whole. There are disturbances that come from outside (external), such as government development 
policies and pandemic disasters. However, there are also those that come from within, namely internal conflicts in 
accessing livelihood sources from oil palm smallholder cooperatives that cause social inequality. From these various 
disturbances, the Mapur indigenous community in Air Abik was able to anticipate by carrying out a cultural identity 
negotiation strategy to maintain life and social integration. The negotiation of cultural identity is implemented through 
the adaptation of PT Timah Tbk's interests related to CSR funds and the interests of the local government related to 
vaccination on the one hand, and on the other hand the interest to develop Mapur culture through gebong memrong as 
a historical and cultural tourism destination as well as the preservation of traditional medicine to prevent pandemics. 
This cultural identity negotiation reflects that the Mapur indigenous community in Air Abik has high social resilience 
as well as being able to save the population from a vicious pandemic.

Abstract 
The covid-19 pandemic has an impact on increasing the number of poor people in Malang City. Women experience a 
double impact; those are economic and psychological shocks. The aims of this research are, first to explore women's 
poverty in Malang City using Multidimensional Poverty Index by Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiatives 
(OPHI); second to explore women's resilience using the women's resilience index using measured indicators 0-1 
Guttman scale. This research uses the quantitative research method. Results of this research are Multidimensional 
Poverty Index in Malang City is low, and the women's resilience index in Malang City is high particularly in household 
decision-making indicators. The lowest indicator of women's resilience is social and institutional capacity. The 
conclusion of this research is there is a relation between women's resilience and poverty, The lower the poverty rate in 
women's households, the higher the tendency of women's resilience. However, policy targets are needed to further 
enhance women's resilience, especially regarding the social and institutional capacities of women.

Introduction
Women and poverty are important studies to explore, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. UNDP says that 
Covid-19 will expand the poverty gap between men and women. By 2021, for every 100 men aged 25-34 years living 
in conditions of extreme poverty (live on an income of around 27 thousand per day), there will be 118 women in 
conditions of extreme poverty (UNDP, 2020) UNDP projects this to increase to 121 women in 100 men living in 
poverty by 2030 (UNDP, 2020). 
The government's policy of limiting community activities during the Covid-19 pandemic has added 306,850 poor 
people in East Java (BPS East Java Province, 2021&2019). Poverty in East Java increased by 1.26% from 2019 to 
11.46% in September 2020 (BPS Province of East Java, 2021). This percentage is higher than the average national 
poverty percentage which was at 10.19% in September 2020 (BPS, 2021). Sampang Regency, Madura, is the poorest 
area in East Java with a percentage of 22.78% in September 2020, while Batu City and Malang City are the areas with 
the lowest poverty rates with a percentage of 3.89% and 4.44% (BPS East Java Province, 2021).  
Another interesting phenomenon concerning poverty in Malang is the open unemployment rate. Below is a table of 
the open unemployment rate in Malang City from 2018 to 2020 (Table 1).

Talking about obstacles in solving social problems in the family, the majority of respondents amounted to 58.8%, or 
as many as 67 respondents from a total of 114 respondents stated that the respondents had never experienced any 
obstacles. While the minority of respondents stated that the obstacles that had occurred were such as unstable family 
members' emotions, family members who were closed to each other, and the apathy of family members to the lack of 
communication. 
While economic problems have occurred in households during the COVID19 pandemic, most respondents by 37% or 
as many as 43 respondents from a total of 114 respondents said they experienced problems with differences in the 
amount of income. In addition, some respondents experience poor money management by 28.1%, debt by 29.8%, not 
having long-term goals by 15.8% to a wasteful attitude by 21.1%. But apart from that, there were also 21.1% or 24 
respondents who stated that the respondents did not experience any economic problems. 
The obstacles in solving these economic problems are most respondents by 40.4% or as many as 46 respondents have 
never experienced any obstacles. But on the other hand, 39.5% or as many as 45 respondents think that the economy 
is a sensitive issue in the household. And followed by other obstacles, such as family members who are closed to each 
other and the apathy of family members. So based on the explanation above, the economic problems that became a 
big problem during the COVID19 pandemic have affected social and institutional capacity indicators. And the 
obstacles experienced when facing social and economic problems have also affected the value of the social and 
institutional capacity indicators obtained by 42.11. 
So based on the exposure of the data that has been obtained on the indicators of return to decisions in the household, 
social participation, economic access, social and institutional capacity above are the things that have influenced the 
resilience index of women in Malang City in 2021. In this case, among the four resilience indicators, indicators The 
dimension of decision-making in the household is one of the highest resilience capacities possessed by women in 
Malang City in 2021.

Conclusion
The conclusion in this study is that Malang City has a low Multidimensional Poverty Index even in the Covid-19 
pandemic. BPS data shows that poverty in the city of Malang increased by 0.4%, however, this did not have a drastic 
impact on multidimensional poverty in the city of Malang. Second, the women's resilience index in Malang City shows 
a high number with an average of 75.77. This shows that when hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, women have a high 
level of resilience.

Abstract 
This paper aims to describe how the development of information on COVID-19 handling policies adopted by the 
government in conditions of people who have cultural diversity and the ability to capture information and how the 
government's relationship with society in the policy. The pandemic in Indonesia began with the government's 
underestimation of the covid-19 virus. Almost all Ministers express their opinions openly to the public, which 
sometimes contradict each other, causing information uncertainty to arise. This paper uses a meta-analysis research 
method to collect scientific evidence regarding the uncertain information during the pandemic era in Indonesia. This 
paper uses a sociological perspective to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis collected from books, previous 
research results, official government letters, and mass media articles. The study results show that: (i) government 
policies regarding the handling of covid-19 are generally successful, but there are shortcomings such as inconsistency, 
and does not provide protection for some people; (ii) there is non-uniform communication to the public, which makes 
the public angry; (iii) literacy and public access to information have different characteristics between different groups, 
and; (iv) the relationship between the community and the government is generally dominated by legal sanctions.

1. Introduction
The Covid-19 virus was discovered in late December 2019 in China. The World Health Organization (WHO) called 
for international attention by declaring a public health emergency caused by the coronavirus / SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-
19) on January 30, 2020. Then WHO, through a press conference on COVID-19 on March 11, 2020, confirmed the
coronavirus as a global pandemic. Meanwhile, the first coronavirus case in Indonesia was found on March 1, 2020, in
Depok, West Jawa. After receiving advice from the WHO, the Indonesian government stated that the Covid-19
pandemic was a national disaster. Officially the status of a national catastrophe was decided on March 31, 2020, by
Presidential Decree of the Republic of Indonesia No. 11 of 2020 concerning the Determination of the Corona Virus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency, and also limiting community activities through Government
Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia No. 21 of 2020 concerning Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB).
Furthermore, on April 13, 2020, the Presidential Decree of the Republic of Indonesia No. 12 of 2020 of the
Determination of Non-Natural Disasters for the Spread of Covid-19 as a National Disaster was issued (Setiawan and
Komalasari, 2020).
Other policies taken by the government include: observing and evacuating Indonesian citizens in Wuhan; alert the 
hospital; carry out strict supervision of 19 areas directly related to China; closing flights to and from China; establish 
a Task Force to speed up the response of coronavirus spreading; work, study, and worship from home; campaigning 
for social distancing; Prohibition of Homecoming through the SE Minister of PANRB Number 46 of 2020 concerning 
Restrictions on Traveling Out of Territory for State Civil Apparatus Employees (ASN); The New Normal Order

Abstract 
Human trafficking that occurs in vulnerable groups such as women is a crime that violates human rights. Until now, 
the practice of buying and selling human beings, especially women, continues to multiply, especially in the pattern of 
victim screening. The reality is that the Covid-19 pandemic has not reduced the number of cases of trafficking in 
women who have socially experienced various inequalities and particular vulnerabilities due to their marginal social 
position, thus making them entangled in indications of trafficking in women that dominate and pose a significant 
threat. The study of intersectionality is considered capable of seeing the different situations faced by women and 
marginalized groups. It becomes a meeting point study on gender issues, especially during the current pandemic, 
which shows the increasing cases of trafficking in women. And the purpose of this research is to explain the form of 
handling the crisis of trafficking in women with intersectionality law regulations. This study uses a qualitative method 
by collecting data on intersectionality law regulations through report documents, literature, news, and journalism 
related to the research. Data analysis used the Nvivo12 Plus qualitative data processing application with crosstab query 
tools analysis and cluster analysis group. Furthermore, the study results show that intersectionality legal regulations 
refer to gender equality. However, these regulations are still ineffective and still discriminate against women or are 
less gender-sensitive to suppress the spread of cases of trafficking in women. The vulnerable sector is shown in the 
sex trade, worrying, especially during the current pandemic. Based on the study results, it is concluded that there is a 
need for new legal regulations regarding intersectionality that provide legal construction as a basis for women in 
fighting against unfair hegemony and guaranteed in various legal instruments, both international and national law.

1. Introduction
Commemoration of World Anti-Trafficking in Human Rights today is different from previous years, when the 
widespread Coronavirus in various countries, some world bodies are commemorating the great potential for worsening 
cases of human trafficking when the coronavirus continues to hit (Mazrieva, 2020). The number of women or children 
as victims of human trafficking is countless even today (Department of State United States of America, 2020) states 
that at least 25 million people are victims of crime. The Inter-Agency Coordination Against Trafficking (ICAT) noted 
that 49% of victims of human trafficking were women and 23% were girls (Sigiro et al., 2020). Furthermore, data 
from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) also prove cases of trafficking in women are very troubling 
with the number of victims being 90.3% of women and 23.6% of girls who are groups vulnerable to violence 
(Sulistyowati, 2021). 
Trafficking in women is a very serious global phenomenon, most victims of trafficking occur in national border areas 
and victims are generally transferred to superpower countries (UNODC, 2021). Trafficking in women includes sexual 
exploitation, forced marriage, forced labor, forced begging, and trafficking of children for the sale and purchase of 
organs, and trafficking in women accounts for more than 60% of migrant worker recruitment (Crawford, 2017). 
Reported to UN data in (UNODC, 2021) The ASEAN region shows cases of trafficking in women from the Mekong 
region, the Middle East, several countries in Africa, Central Asia, Russia, and Sri Lanka as well as various other 
Southeast Asian regions. sexual and labor, this is in line with the report of The Straits Times (Khotimah, 2019).

Examining the dimensions of the policy issued by CEDAW does not significantly touch the upstream of the existing 
problems, especially related to trafficking in women. As in some countries, there are still ambiguity factors, 
capabilities, and different temporal dimensions. All the efforts that have been made by CEDAW are considered to be 
less comprehensive and in-depth so it is necessary to have a renewal starting from the concept, systematization, 
regulation, and implementation. Moreover, efforts to increase cooperation in ASEAN should not be ignored. The form 
of the new regulation should also provide an umbrella for fellow ASEAN members to minimize all forms of human 
trafficking, especially women and children. 
Therefore, Efforts to minimize the crime of human trafficking, especially women and children, have so far not shown 
maximum results, for that all forms of acceleration of regulatory reform should continue to be carried out. This is done 
by considering the balance from many points of view to obtain objective and comprehensive results. Previously there 
was a formal mechanism that could be used to tackle the crime of trafficking in persons, including women and children, 
namely the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) but it was not effective 
because it did not explain in detail the procedures for dealing with the crime of trafficking in women. 
If we refer to the criticism of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and 
various other UN conventions in the enforcement of human rights, they have various shortcomings with inappropriate 
perspectives. The urgency of intersectionality is then able to identify forms of multiple discrimination. The study of 
intersectionality is a cross-sectional study for system relations in the form of oppression, domination, or 
discrimination, where the urgency of intersectionality is not only based on a single point of crime against women but 
also based on race, class, gender, age, global location, and sexual preferences so that it can cover and cover problems 
related to women's and gender issues, especially in the case of trafficking in women. 
Thus, extensive reforms in legal regulations related to trafficking in women can be developed with the concept of 
intersectionality, in  which  intersectionality becomes  the  urgency of  new  regulations  to  analyze various 
discrimination against women which are part of human rights violations so the concept of new legal urgency can 
provide an umbrella for acts of discrimination resulting from a combination of cases of violence against women. 
woman. With the concept of intersectionality in law enforcement, Indonesian women and children victims of human 
trafficking can be identified and classified as victims of what kind of crime with a legal order that is adjusted to the 
severity of the crime in the discrimination category. 
6. Conclusion
The crime of trafficking in women is a problem that has long been a major international problem and continues to this 
day. Criminal behavior is also triggered by various indicators where the vulnerable sectors that trigger and become 
motivators of crime are at the economic, social, and cultural levels, where the targets of trafficking in women are 
mostly traded as sex workers and unskilled workers. In addition, at this time, the need for social distancing due to the 
Covid-19 pandemic is also a factor in increasing unemployment due to layoffs, which is a problem for increasing 
crime because victims of layoffs are unable to meet their daily needs. 
This research also overall shows that in eradicating trafficking in women, the government must increase efforts and 
cooperation with related parties dealing with child trafficking such as Komnas HAM, police, courts, etc. law so that 
every regulation in the country does not conflict and the public understand the importance of legal certainty when 
faced with serious problems directly. From this research, it is also hoped that the obstacles and shortcomings in the 
handling of trafficking in women and children can be addressed with new legal regulations that bind firmly and clearly 
for the safety of the community.

indicate that experience is also essential in helping the quality of human resources at the Regional Secretariat of 
Bantaeng Regency. However, low work experience can still be overcome through training or overtime employees 
work to become qualified in carrying out their main tasks and functions sooner or later. They are given at the Regional 
Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency. 
 
5.6. The Influence of HR Management on Employee Performance through HR Quality 
Through the results of the Sobel test in this study, the authors can describe that the quality of human resources can 
mediate human resource management on the performance of employees at the Regional Secretariat of Bantaeng 
Regency. This means that the quality of human resources is the key to the success of a good HR management action 
at the Bantaeng Regency Regional Secretariat in realizing employee performance. This means that even though the 
regional secretariat can have quality HR management, it can manage employee placement as needed. They are 
employee development through formal-informal education, correct remuneration, effective communication, and 
employee work discipline. However, it does not have quality human resources or Low education levels, limited 
employee training opportunities, joint problem solving, and inexperienced employees. It will undoubtedly have 
difficulty realizing employees who perform well according to the needs and demands of the Bantaeng Regency 
Regional Secretariat. 
 
The results of this study are following the opinion of Simamora in Hartatik. She says that human resource management 
has social and ethical responsibilities towards the needs and challenges of society (Hartatik, 2014). As well as 
minimizing the negative impact of these demands on the organization, having formal organizational goals, maintaining 
the contribution of the HR department at the level of Following the needs of the organization, HR management must 
focus on achieving harmony between the knowledge, abilities, conditions, and interests of employees and the 
organization. 
 
5.7. The Influence of the Work Environment on Employee Performance through the Quality of 
Human Resources 
The authors' results describe that the quality of human resources can mediate the work environment and employee 
performance at the Regional Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency. This means that the quality of human resources is a 
variable that will determine the success of the function and role of the work environment in achieving employee 
performance at the Regional Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency. The author believes that the regional secretariat has 
already had a physical work environment and a non-physical work environment that can support employee 
performance. The most important thing is that the employee can utilize and use the work environment as a supporting 
facility to maximize performance at the Regional Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency. 
 
The results of this study are following the research of Ninda Rolena (Poetry.2019), entitled 'The influence of the work 
environment on the quality of human resources has an impact on the performance of employees of PT. Madani 
Nasional Permodalan (PERSERO)', the study results stated that there was a positive and significant influence between 
the work environment on employee performance through the quality of human resources. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Human resource management, work environment, and quality of human resources directly affect the performance of 
employees at the Regional Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency. This means that the performance of employees at the 
Regional Secretariat can be continuously improved with good human resource management, a good work 
environment, and reliable quality of human resources. Furthermore, the quality of human resources is an intervening 
variable that can mediate human resource management and work environment on employee performance at the 
Regional Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency. This means that the quality of human resources in the Regional Secretariat 
will improve the quality of human resource management so that it can have implications for improving employee 
performance at the Regional Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency.

1. Introduction
Human resources are one of the implementing elements in organizational activities that are tasked and responsible for
carrying out operational activities of the organization. Therefore, human resources are objects of achieving goals and
become actors to realize organizational goals (Astuti & Buqhari, 2018).
 The profession is a job that is carried out as the main activity to earn a living and relies on expertise. Meanwhile, 
professionalism is the commitment of professionals to their profession and the 'spirit' or spirit, way of thinking, 
methods, and practices that permeate and describe a series of characteristics of the work in question.

observations and interviews, it shows that several officers do not have a professional attitude in their work, so it 
impacts their discipline and performance. 
 
According to the Big Indonesian Dictionary, professionalism is defined as something that requires particular skills to 
carry it out. Professional is a set of skills needed to do a job that is carried out efficiently and effectively with a high 
level of expertise to achieve maximum work goals (Indarti, 2014). 
 
The professional attitude of the police officers at the Jeneponto Police Station is reflected in the implementation of 
quality work that meets three criteria. They have the expertise to carry out tasks according to their field, carry job or 
profession by setting standard standards in the discipline concerned and take carry. 
 
The attitude of professionalism can also have an impact on the discipline of the police, as stated by Prijodarnanto, who 
explains that what is meant by field is the conditions created and formed through the process of a series of behaviors 
that show the values of obedience, obedience, loyalty, order, and order. These values have become part of the behavior 
in his life (Wanta, 2017). This behavior is created through the process of fostering through family, education, and 
experience. So, it can be understood that discipline is integrated within a person. The field is obtained from the 
coaching that starts from the smallest and simplest environment, namely the family. 
 
Discipline coaching from the family is beneficial in shaping behavior in him and can achieve self-discipline. 
Muchdarsyah argues: Discipline is a mental attitude that is reflected in the actions or behavior of individuals, groups, 
or communities in the form of obedience to the actions or provisions set by the government or ethics, norms, and rules 
that apply in society for specific purposes (Muchdarsyah, 2003). 
 
This research is in line with the theory put forward by Mangkunegara in Evi Fransiska, which states that the attitude 
of professionalism and discipline of employees at work is one of the factors in supporting employee performance that 
organizational goals can be achieved (Fransiska, 2019). These results are also supported by Evi Fransiska's research 
with the title The Effect of Professionalism, Experience, and Discipline on the Performance of the Office of the 
Ministry of Religion of Probolinggo Regency. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The professionalism variable partially shows a positive and significant influence on the performance of the police 
officers at the Jeneponto Police Station, which means that the better the professionalism, the better the performance 
of the police officers. Then the discipline variable partially shows a positive and significant influence on the 
performance of the police officers at the Jeneponto Police Station, which means that the better the discipline, the better 
the performance of the police officers. Then the professionalism variable partially shows a positive and significant 
influence on the domain of the police officers at the Jeneponto Police Station, which means the better the 
professionalism, the more disciplined it will be. And, the professionalism variable partially shows a positive and 
significant effect on performance through the discipline of police officers at Polres Jeneponto, which means the better 
the professionalism, the better the understanding through the field.

5. Conclusion
If skills are improved and perfected, employees will be motivated to work. The reward will encourage employees to 
work hard. If our motivation is good, we will automatically succeed. If we are good enough, our stat performance will 
increase, and if we do not have power, we’ll have less turnover. Higher employee rewards will improve employee 
performance, and if the tips are lower or lower, client performance will decline work. By providing fair compensation 
to employees, they will be motivated to develop and improve the workforce. If incentives increase, labor productivity 
will increase to improve employee performance.

1. Introduction
Economic mobilization affects the increasing mobility of people and goods, either by land, sea, or air. This increased 
transportation and frequency of transportation traffic, especially flights passing through Indonesia, because Indonesia's 
territory is classified as strategic on international and national transportation routes.  
Indonesia is one of the regions that is often traversed by international flight and shipping routes. Indonesia's vast 
airspace and sea areas provide an advantage in flight routes for Southeast Asia and Australia routes. With such 
conditions, to improve the smoothness and quality of air transportation services, the implementation in the field is

Abstract 
The Purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of patient satisfaction in moderating nurses' quality of service and 
performance on patient loyalty at the Lasepang Health Center, Bantaeng Regency. This research was conducted at 
Lasepang Health Center, Bantaeng Regency, performed for two months from November to December 2020. The 
design of this study was a survey with a quantitative approach. The sample in this research was 50 respondents from 
patients who came for treatment at the Lasepang Health Center, Bantaeng Regency. The sampling technique is 
accidental sampling. Data collection was carried out through observation, questionnaires, interviews, documentation, 
while the data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. The study results indicated that nurses' quality of service 
and performance had a significant positive impact on patient loyalty. Thus, to increase patient loyalty, it is necessary 
to have a quality service that can match the benefits intended for the health center (expected service) with the services 
received or experienced (perceived usefulness) from the sufferer or the results experienced. In addition to the quality 
of service, increased patient loyalty is also influenced by the performance of nurses. With the nurse implementation, 
the results of the nurse work in terms of quality, nurses get from carrying out their duties and their responsibilities as 
charged. Then it was proven that patient satisfaction was able to moderate the effect of service quality and nurse 
performance on patient loyalty at the Lasepang Health Center, Bantaeng Regency. Thus, patient satisfaction, namely 
the level of a patient's feeling, is the result of an analogy between evaluating the ability or the outcome of health 
services. The patient's dream in the patient's totality of the patient's experience to the health agency strengthens service 
quality and nurse performance on patient loyalty.

The test showed an R Square value of 0.751 or 75.1% (Table 6). The deal showed that nurse performance variables 
and patient satisfaction predicted patient loyalty variables of 75.1%, while the remaining 24.9% were explained by 
other predictors that were not studied.

5. Discussion 
Effect of Quality of service on Patient Loyalty. This research is in line with previous research conducted by Ritna 
Dewi, Zulhafiqi, Setyo Budiarto conclusions that the quality of service has a significant positive impact on patient 
loyalty. The managerial implication on the effect of quality of service on patient loyalty is the patient's commitment 
to voluntarily always come to the Health Center to perform medical treatment and recommend the Health Center 
service (Dewi, 2016; Zulhafiqi, 2014; Budiarto, 2012). Effect of Nurse Performance on Patient Loyalty. This research 
is in line with previous research conducted by Imamah Nudyatama, Lia Nurmila, Roby Irzal Maulana, based on the 
results of his study that employee performance influences customer loyalty (Nudyatama, 2017; Nurmila, 2018; 
Maulana, 2019).  
 
Patient Satisfaction Moderates the Effect of Service Quality on Patient Loyalty. This research is supported by the view 
that the factors affecting patient loyalty are the quality of service. The managerial implication on patient satisfaction 
in moderating the quality of service to patient loyalty is the level of feeling condition of a sufferer. The result of 
analogy between evaluating the ability or the development of health services is about the sufferer's dream in the state 
of experience of the totality of the sufferer to the health agency moderating the quality of service to the patient's loyalty 
using service procedures.

Patient Satisfaction Moderates the Effect of Nurse Performance on Patient Loyalty. The statement supports this 
research that the factors that affect patient loyalty are nurses' performance (Nursalam, (2008). In empirical studies, it 
was found that nurse performance on patient loyalty has not been conclusive. In other words, some researchers create 
significant consequences, and others create no critical repercussions. For Sekaran, if the two-factor bond has not been 
conclusive until the researchers can further put the elastic moderation to clarify the bond. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From the results and discussion, it can be concluded where the quality of service with the performance of nurses has 
a significant impact on patient loyalty. It is necessary to provide quality of service to increase patient loyalty that can 
conform to the desired quality in Health Center (expected benefit), and services felt or received (perceived service) 
from patients or perceived results. Then it was proven that the patient's satisfaction was able to moderate the impact 
of the quality of service and nurses' work on patient loyalty in the Lasepang Health Center, Bantaeng Regency. Thus, 
patient satisfaction is the level of the emotional condition of a sufferer. The result of the analogy between evaluation 
or final product of health services is about the sufferer's dream in the condition of the experience of the totality of the 
sufferer to the health board precisely strengthens the influence of the quality of service and performance of nurses on 
patient loyalty.

Abstract 
The increasing number of Covid-19 cases and death rates and the spread across regions and countries indicate that the 
feed has been extraordinary and has impacted political, economic, social, cultural defense and security aspects, and 
Indonesia's people's welfare. Referring to the available evidence, Covid-19 is transmitted through close contact and 
droplet splashes, not through air transmission. The most effective preventive measures in the community: hand 
hygiene; Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth; applying cough etiquette; wearing a mask; maintain a distance (at 
least 1 meter). The research objective of this study was to analyze the effect of health promotion and personal hygiene 
on the incidence of Covid-19 through physical distancing in the Central Mamuju Regency. Quantitative research 
methods with analytical survey methods are used as a research method. Data collection through questionnaire 
distribution was carried out in Central Mamuju District. The sample was determined by a sampling technique using 
the Slovin formula, which was then sorted according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The model that was 
successfully collected came from 137 respondents. The analysis used in this research is path analysis. Based on the 
results of the study, it was found that 1) health promotion did not affect physical distancing; 2) personal hygiene has 
a positive and significant effect on physical distancing; and 3) Health promotion, personal hygiene, and physical 
distancing did not have a substantial impact on the incidence of Covid-19 in Central Mamuju District. Health 
promotion and personal hygiene have a negative but insignificant effect on the incidence of Covid-19 through physical 
distancing in Central Mamuju Regency.

Abstract 
This article focuses on the problem of Islamic boarding schools failing to foster and create a healthy environment in 
the physical environment of the boarding school. Some Islamic boarding schools are still vulnerable to providing clean 
water and have environmental sanitation problems. This paper aims to explain why these problems can occur in the 
Islamic boarding school environment, how the efforts of Islamic boarding schools to overcome these problems are 
experienced by Islamic boarding schools, and what obstacles are experienced by Islamic boarding schools in realizing 
a sanitary environment. This study was conducted on a small scale, namely at the Darut Taqwa Ngalah Islamic 
Boarding School in Pasuruan Regency, East Java. This study uses a case study approach in the data collection process, 
with observation and interview techniques. The results showed that the problem of environmental sanitation in Islamic 
boarding schools is a complex problem because it is triggered by various factors, namely the physical, social and 
cultural environment. These factors are interrelated and cannot be separated from each other in shaping the behavior 
of students who are less clean and healthy.

1. Introduction
Pesantren is an Islamic educational institution in Indonesia. This institution is classified as traditional in which students 
are required to live together and study under the guidance of a teacher who is better known as a kyai. Such an education 
system turned out to be the result of adaptation of educational practices in the period before the entry of Islam in 
Indonesia, namely the Hindu-Buddhist period. This can be seen from the naming of pesantren which can not be 
separated from the terminology that exists in Hindu circles. The word pesantren is rooted in the word santri with the 
prefix ""pe"" and the suffix ""an"". The term comes from the Indian language, namely ""Shasti"", which means ""people who 
know the sacred books of Hinduism"" or ""a scholar of Hindu scriptures."" The word Shastri itself comes from the word 
shastra, which means sacred books, religious books, or knowledge. (Haedari, 1985). 
This learning system, which requires students to live together with their teachers, makes the pesantren always equipped 
with a dormitory as a place to stay for the students. Therefore, the term 'pesantren' is also often attached or added to 
the term 'pondok' so that it becomes a unified term, namely pondok pesantren or Islamic boarding school. The 
unification of these two terms forms one understanding, namely the place of learning for students (Malik; Nath et al.; 
Suharyanto et al.). Like a boarding school, a pesantren is also usually equipped with a mosque for worship, a room 
for study and other religious activities that are gathered in one complex. This complex is usually surrounded by a wall 
as a form of supervision over the activities of entering and leaving the students in accordance with the regulations in 
force at the lodge (Dhofier, 1985). 
In Indonesia, Islamic boarding schools are religious-based educational institutions whose development cannot be 
separated from the community in which the boarding school grows and develops. If viewed from a historical point of 
view, in general, Islamic boarding schools are located in rural areas and are integrated with the life of the village 
community. Therefore, life in Islamic boarding schools has a very diverse setting because it is shaped by social and 
cultural situations as well as the physical environment in accordance with the existence of the Islamic boarding school 
(Elizabeth, 2017). 
When linking the relationship between Islamic boarding schools and the surrounding environment, Islamic boarding 
schools generally have a role as a reference for the community where the Islamic boarding school is located. Islamic 
boarding schools are also a driving force in community development and development. At least there are several 
reasons that cause this, namely because the Islamic boarding school is a source for studying religious knowledge

The next program is the cadre of students through field schools and periodic seminars. Several representative students 
from each dormitory (usually the boarding school administrators) were included in the field school program initiated 
by IWINS. In this field school, the students are introduced and given knowledge about how a clean, healthy lifestyle 
and environmental sanitation are applied in everyday life. Participants are also given regular seminars to strengthen 
their knowledge in the field of environmental sanitation. The result of this program is that the students finally know 
and have awareness about the importance of maintaining personal and environmental hygiene to maintain their health. 
5.3. Some Obstacles in Program Implementation  
The strengthening program carried out by the pesantren in collaboration with IWINS is not without problems. Some 
of the answers from the students that the researchers found during the interview indicated that there were several 
obstacles that came from the gap between the program concept and the environmental reality of the students. For 
example, in the clean toilet procurement program that was initiated, it turned out to have shortcomings because it did 
not take into account the large number of water consumers with the capacity of clean water provided. So what happens 
is that some bathrooms can't have water perfectly. As a result, there were some bathrooms which ended up not being 
used because there was no water. Even if they were used, the students had to bring a bucket filled with water first. The 
concept of a shower bathroom does not seem to fit the environmental conditions of the Ngalah Islamic boarding school 
dormitory because in each bathroom there is no bathtub that can accommodate water as an anticipation when the water 
availability is low.  
 
The concept of an individual bathroom is also a separate obstacle for the students. This is because the very large 
number of students in one dormitory requires them to queue for a long time if they want to use the bathroom. The 
result is the emergence of bathing behavior that is not routinely carried out, the behavior of damaging the bathroom 
door due to impatient waiting in line and feeling sleepy at school due to lack of sleep due to queuing for the bathroom 
since midnight. This is further strengthened by the recognition of the students who crave the communal bathroom 
which used to exist before being replaced with an individual bathroom. In the communal bathroom, the students tend 
not to experience incidents like the one above because they can bathe together. Here's an excerpt from her confession: 
“ya enak dulu (with laugh)...ya kan kalau satu-satu itu nggak tau itu dilama-lamain atau gimana. Kalau bareng-
bareng kan bisa ikut-ikutan di sampingnya, jadi bisa cepet gitu buk. Jadikan nggak ada yang telat gitu. Kalau nunggu 
kan pintunya ditutup, jadi nggak ketauan itu ada siapa, biasanya lama.” (The results of the interview Thursday 15 
February 2018 at 12.00 WIB at the Ngalah Islamic Boarding School's female dormitory)  
 
In addition to the problem of the toilet construction program, several obstacles were also found in the cadre program 
for the students. These obstacles include the problem of the lack of activity of the cadre students to participate in the 
training programs and seminars held. Some students expressed the reason for their inactivity due to the attitude of 
having to be accompanied by their playmates when participating in the training, so that when one person was unable 
to attend, the other students would not attend. As a result, these students do not regularly attend seminar programs that 
are held regularly, so that they end up missing out on information and cannot understand the materials for the next 
seminar. As a result, over time they end up not being active at all in the training program. 
 
The cadre process also encountered problems, because, on average, the cadres were dormitory administrators, who, 
incidentally, were old students who would soon graduate and leave the boarding school. There is no written rule that 
regulates how the boarding school organizational system is run in the pesantren. So that what happens is that the 
process of changing the board is only carried out when the previous management has graduated from the boarding 
school. The process of appointing a new board is also not through voting or deliberation of the residents of the 
dormitory, but it is the prerogative of the previous board to choose who is appropriate. This is, of course, a weakness, 
because the standardization of management criteria is very subjective. This kind of cadre process also resulted in the 
disconnection of the IWINS program with the santri cadres because the santri who were involved in the training 
program were no longer in the boarding school when they graduated. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The problem of environmental sanitation in the Ngalah Islamic boarding school is a fairly complex problem because 
it is triggered by various factors, namely: 1. a physical environment where the large number of students is not matched 
by adequate room and water capacity, 2. The factor of the social environment where the number of students who live 
in cottages with various cultural and regional backgrounds can certainly produce diverse patterns of interaction among 
the students, 3. Cultural factors in which a lifestyle characterized by Sufism is always instilled so that this qana'ah trait

can be embedded in the students. These factors are interrelated and cannot be separated from each other in shaping 
the behavior of students who are less clean and healthy.  
 
In order to solve this problem, Pondok Ngalah cooperates with IWINS-USAID through a toilet construction program 
and training of santri cadres which in its implementation cannot be separated from several external and internal 
constraints of the Islamic boarding school. These obstacles include the gap between the program concept and the 
environmental reality of the students, such as the construction of toilets that do not pay attention to the water capacity 
(water source) in the cottage environment and also the very large number of students. Another problem is the inactivity 
of the cadre students to participate in training programs and seminars held and the absence of written rules governing 
how the organizational system of the hostel is run in the pesantren.   
 
Based on the results of this study, the suggestion from the researcher is that the Islamic boarding school needs to 
consider the number of students who are accepted with the capacity of the Islamic boarding school. The boarding 
school needs to think about the ideal comparison between the number of students accepted and the capacity of the 
Islamic boarding school. Infrastructure factors or cottage facilities such as room size, toilet rooms and so on are very 
important to create a sanitary environment in Islamic boarding schools. The hope is that with a clean, tidy and not 
crowded or jostling environment, the learning and teaching process at the cottage can run smoothly and clean and 
healthy living behavior can also easily grow in the students.  
 
In addition to improvements in the context of infrastructure, Islamic boarding schools also need to strengthen pesantren 
institutions to the lowest level, such as the existing rules in dormitories. The organizational system in the dormitory 
needs to be regulated in such a way that the process of inheriting clean and healthy living behavior that has been 
initiated through the cadres of students in the dormitory can continue to be spread to other students and also passed 
on to the next generation of students. The government also needs to take part in creating a sanitary environment in the 
Islamic boarding school environment, such as providing control and appealing to the owners of Islamic boarding 
schools to continue to pay attention to the facilities owned by the Islamic boarding schools and inviting the Islamic 
boarding schools to cooperate in related programs. with improving public health. Financial assistance can also be 
provided by the government to encourage the improvement and development of better and more adequate Islamic 
boarding school facilities.

Abstract 
The issue of masculinity is still an issue that is often discussed in society. Masculinity is often described as the image 
of a man with a strong body and a position that is superior to women. Over time, the concept of masculinity began to 
shift. Masculinity is now starting to be depicted with feminine men. The depiction was introduced through Korean 
entertainment media (Hallyu). One way is through the boyband BTS. This study aims to explain the representation of 
masculinity to BTS fans. The theory used in this research is social representation theory according to Stuart Hall. The 
research methodology used in this study is qualitative with a phenomenological approach. Researchers get data from 
the Instagram account @bts.bighiofficial to find a form of representation of the masculinity of BTS fans. The results 
found are 1) The new masculinity that exists in society is depicted by men who have feminine traits. 2) Through social 
media Instagram, members of BTS are able to represent the masculinity of their fans. 
Keywords 
Representation, Masculinity, BTS, Instagram and Hallyu. 
1. Introduction
The issue of gender is still one of the debates in society. Society often distinguishes between men and women based 
on what they display. As in the patriarchal system, a man is often described as strong, courageous, and must be able 
to solve problems. Meanwhile, women are often depicted as weak, gentle, and in need of protection from others 
(Budiastuti and Wulan, 2014). This depiction causes the standard of masculinity and femininity in society. Emerging 
standards often lead to gender inequalities that can be experienced by both women and men. Standards about 
masculinity and femininity are usually propagated through culture, including popular culture (Budiastuti and Wulan, 
2014). One of the popular culture that is becoming a trend in society is Hallyu (Korean Wave). The Hallyu 
phenomenon occurs in both European and Asian countries such as Indonesia. Based on data released by Twitter, 
within 1 year Indonesia was ranked fourth with the largest K-Pop fans on Twitter (Febriastuti 2020). The data is issued 
based on the number of posts by Twitter users in Indonesia. 
The Hallyu phenomenon spreads through music, films, and drama series that are broadcast through digital media. 
Music in Hallyu is dominated by boybands and girlbands (Lee and Zhang, 2021). The existence of boybands and 
girlbands is able to have a considerable impact on the emergence of social communities among fans. Boyband and 
girlband fan communities are often referred to as fandoms (fanbase) which are often found on social media (Fella and 
Abdus Sair 2020). Some names of Korean boyband and girlband fanbases include Blink which is the designation of 
the BLACKPINK girlband fanbase, Army which is the BTS boyband fanbase, ELF which is the Super Junior boyband 
fanbase, and there are still several other fanbase names (Wahyudi, 2020). 
One of the South Korean boy bands that is currently popular and is being talked about is BTS (Bangtan Sonyeondan 
or Bulletproof Boy Scouts). The BTS boyband itself has quite a lot of fans in Indonesia. Based on the observations of 
researchers on one Twitter account, the BTS fanbase has been followed by 135 thousand Twitter users. In addition, 
on Instagram social media several BTS fanbase accounts. Fanbase account were also found with 49.8 million followers 
is @bts.bighitofficial (@bts.bighitofficial: 2021). The @bts.bighitofficial account provides treats related to BTS' 
albums. The treats are displayed neatly so that they attract the eyes of those who see them. Through these social media, 
BTS fans were treated to activities from each BTS member. In addition, on the @bts.bighitofficial Instagram account, 
the appearance of each BTS member looks different from the concept of other K-Pop idols. The body image displayed 
by each member is able to influence every fan and make it a standard of masculinity. They build an attractive body 
image that is different from the others. Social media Instagram, so far comes with interesting photo and video content

are haters. Army also often has a rigid image of people outside the community. Army can also be referred to as an 
Exclusive community. They think that people outside the Army will not understand the topic of BTS. Army members 
also often use imaginative language when talking to fellow soldiers. For example, an Army member who idolizes a 
BTS member named Jin will think of himself as a wife, sister, brother, or friend in Jin's real world. Likewise with 
other bias fans. 
 
Several informants stated that the masculine concept displayed by BTS through Instagram also influenced them in 
choosing a partner. Although, from a visual perspective, they admit that they don't really expect to get a partner who 
is similar to their biased idol. The Army prioritizes similarities in terms of traits, be it maturity, cuteness, affection, 
and the gentle nature that they catch from BTS members. This they captured and represented from the Instagram 
account @bts.bighitofficial. 
 
5.4 Validation 
In addition, posting on the Instagram social media account @bts.bighitofficial is a form of representation of 
masculinity to BTS fans. Social representation is a form of reproduction of the meaning that exists in society. Stuart 
Hall argues that in the process of social reproduction, there are several things involved, including language, signs, and 
images. Some of the things involved in the process of social reproduction are representative of something (Kurnia 
2004). In this section, the language, signs, and images in the @bts.bighitofficial Instagram account are a representation 
of masculinity for K-Pop fans. 
 
The language of BTS fans reflects admiration for the image being posted on the @bts.bighitofficial account. They 
praised every performance displayed by BTS members. In addition, every fan has a responsibility to support the work 
of their idol. If BTS participates in a voting competition, every fan must vote. On social activities carried out by BTS, 
every fan is ready to spend some money to launch these activities (Fachrosi et al. 2020). Signs such as the brand used 
by BTS members are also an important aspect that can be seen in the depiction of the representation of masculinity. 
The goods advertised by BTS are always crowded in the market. For example, the BTS Meal product that attracts 
people's enthusiasm (Safitri 2021). The sensation of eating together with BTS members makes every fan interested in 
buying these products. In addition, there is an exchange of symbols among BTS fans in buying BTS Meal products. 
 
Regarding signs, many signs are used between BTS members and Army. For example, the color purple, the color 
means I will believe and love you forever (Kumparan, 2020). The meaning of this color was revealed by a BTS 
member named V (Taehyung) at the end of a fan meeting appearance in November 2016. The color was then identical 
to BTS and Army. In addition, the researchers also found a lot of use of the purple love emoji in the comments column 
of the @bts.bighitofficial Instagram account. BTS fans always give praise in all the comments column. 
 
In addition to purple, the sign that is often used between Army and BTS is the character BT21. The character is in the 
form of a doll that describes each member of BTS. Dolls are usually identical as girls' games, but for Army and BTS 
dolls are likened to the characters of each BTS member. Army that has it can feel close to every member of BTS. This 
then attracted the attention of the Army more than just idolizing through the screen. The appearance of each BTS 
member also brings out masculine signs. The earrings they use and the clothes they wear are usually categorized as 
unisex (can be used by both men and women). these signs are then consumed by fans and create a new form of 
masculinity according to the thing captured by the Army. The signs that appear between BTS and Army further explain 
what Army means as a form of masculinity. They won't care about other opinions that think BTS is not masculine. 
 
The process of social representation in society is also supported by the existence of social media. The media, in this 
case the @bts.bighitofficial Instagram account, greatly influences the image of masculinity on BTS fans. They are 
able to become agents who direct the thoughts of their followers. The reality that exists in the world of BTS fans is 
constructed from the language they read, the signs they see, and the images that appear on social media. This shows 
that the representation of masculinity that appears on Instagram social media accounts is depicted with white men, 
using accessories, and having high traits and intelligence. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The shift in the meaning of masculinity in society is one of the impacts of technological developments, especially 
social media. On social media Instagram, it was found that the concept of masculinity among BTS fans is shown 
845","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

through men who are white, use accessories, use bright colors, and have a gentle and kind nature. The masculinity 
indicator that appears on social media Instagram is a form of representation of the masculinity of BTS fans.

Abstract 
The government's mission to improve people's welfare through the maize agropolitan program has apparently only 
been enjoyed by farmers. Meanwhile, peasants do not move from poor conditions. Peasants are getting poorer when 
they follow the government's advice to implement agricultural technology. Peasants get a lot of crops but mostly to 
pay for agricultural facilities. In order to survive, some choose to become tenant peasant, some still apply local 
wisdom; held the mopo'a huta (soil fertilizing) ritual. By this ritual, peasants believe that they will get help from the 
spirits of nature. they will provide soil fertility and save crops from pests. In this way, peasants only get a small 
amount, but the cost of implementing technology is low, so peasants still receive benefits. This paper concludes that 
the mopo'a huta ritual is a way for peasants to resist agropolitan programs. 
Keywords 
Agropolitan Program, Maize, Resistance, peasants, and Mopo'a Huta Ritual. 
1. Introduction
The agropolitan program, which was initiated by the provincial government on a macro level, has been proven to have 
increased maize production. This puts Gorontalo province in the fourth rank of corn contributors at the national level 
in 2019. Based on data from the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, Gorontalo Province in 2019 successfully 
produced 1.4 million tons and it is targeted that by 2020 the planting area for corn can increase to over 300 thousand 
hectares, as written by Jawapos.com (2020). The adoption of agricultural technology is the key to that success. 
However, on a micro level, the adoption of technology has not solved the problem, so the peasant community in the 
village of Molamahu Gorontalo held the mopo'a huta ritual as a way out of drought, soil fertility and plant pests. The 
mopo'a huta ritual contains dayango dances to invite spirits accompanied by the sound of towohu for several nights. 
At the end of the ritual, the community makes offerings (sesajen) to be offered to spirits. According to the belief of 
peasants who adhere to this ritual, spirits who control nature will immediately send rain, fertilize the soil and disinfect 
plant pests. The enthusiasm of the peasant community to hold the dayango dance cannot be stopped, even though 
there have been several times tensions between the community and security forces who did not give permission, the 
Gorontalo district government finally allowed the community to conduct dayango ritual, as written by 
Republikpos.com (2018). 
As far as the author has investigated, studies on the mopo'a huta ritual in which there are dayango dances can be 
grouped into two clusters. First; studies that still revolve around descriptions of the negative stigma against dayango 
dances such as heresy, infidelity, duality of God, animism and deviant beliefs, (Niaga, 2013) (Galuwo, 2018) (Abbas, 
2020). Second; studies that show the practice of the Dayango dance as a ritual to reject disease outbreaks and ask for 
rain and fertility (Saud, 2012); (Hunowu et al., 2020). As written by Saud (Saud, 2012), Dayango dance has specific 
purposes, for example mass treatment, rejecting disease outbreaks, asking for rain and soil fertility, etc. Meanwhile, 
according to Niaga (Niaga, 2013): and Galuwo (Galuwo, 2018), spirits who have been given sesajen are tasked with 
caring for the universe, maintaining plants, and treating diseases that attack living things. From the two clusters, it can 
be seen that holding the mopo'a huta ritual as an effort to minimize the high costs of using agricultural technology has

technology causes them to return to their traditional conditions. Hold the mopo'a huta ritual as a form of resistance. A 
veiled resistance as argued by Scott, (2000), poor peasants survive by resisting, stealing bitterness, delaying and 
slowing down work, malingering, etc.  
The resistance of the peasants by holding the mopo'a huta ritual was getting weaker as the number of followers 
decreased. The solidarity that strengthens them through the mutual cooperation tradition of providing ritual equipment 
is no longer sufficient for ritual implementation so that the costs are heavier and the implementation is random, as a 
result the ritual effect is no longer effective. Thus it can be said that the resistance of the peasants is getting weaker. 
There needs to be serious partisanship from the government to help small farmers, for example programming 
environmentally friendly agriculture and holding farmer savings and loan cooperation (koperasi). Koperasi that truly 
becomes a farmer partner in providing production facilities and accommodating farmers' harvest (Susilo, 2013) not a 
koperasi owned by entrepreneur as an instrument to exploit the peasants. Agricultural koperasi has an important role 
in supporting small farmers to increase market access, improve peasants’ bargaining power, and increase their ability 
to adopt technology. 
This research is limited to showing that the mopo'a huta ritual is a traditional agricultural practice which is a form of 
resistance from the peasants against modernization. Have not seen in depth the values and implications of the mopo'a 
huta ritual in forming community solidarity. Another aspect that is important to explore is another form of peasant 
resistance. Future research can look deeper into the patron-client relationship that traps the peasants in endless poverty.

Difable Women: Marginalized Identities

Abstract 
Women in  their gender  identity  is  second sex, which is  the second  sex which means occupying the subordinate 
position  of the first  sex   (male)  as  the dominant  position.  This is inseparable from the patriarchal  culture  that 
places the position  of  women below men, as well as  women  have limited  roles, especially in public   spaces. It 
cannot be  denied  until  now the  domestic  sphere  is  still  considered  as a responsibility of    women.  What 
about women with disabilities  or people with disabilities? Disabled groups are a  minority  group  that has  been 
neglected for their rights. They are a minor, marginalized group, whose disability identity often    stigmatizes 
helplessness and  incompetence. Women  with disabilities, of course,  have  problems  that  can be said to be more 
complex  than  'normal'  women in  general. Not  only  confined to patriarchal culture, the negative stigma  labeled 
becomes  increasingly  severe  for  women with disabilities. This study was  about  women  with disabilities  who 
experience  stigma,  not  only  stigma  against  women, but  stigma  against  difable  women. Their identity as 
women with disabilities is an experience that represents  the marginalization of this minority  group. The subjects 
of  this  study were women with disabilities who were both married  and   unmarried. The  results showed  that 
the stigma labeled on  women with disabilities seemed to be an  identity  attached  to them. It  is  then even 
believed by them themselves. Nevertheless, there is a subjective  awareness in these disabled women to then try 
to  get out of the negative  stigma, but the support that is expected to come from people with disabilities. Their 
surroundings are less  felt. The research method used  is a qualitative  research method  with  a  symbolic 
interaction  perspective.  The theories used  are  George H. Mead's  theory  of  symbolic interaction and the theory 
of stigma  and  identity  of  Erving Goffman.

1. Introduction
The study of identity is a study that has been widely discussed in the last period.  This is as a consequence and 
part of the development of thought and knowledge in the contemporary social field, such as the development of 
feminism, postmodernism, and the latter postcolonial that prioritizes thinking about the concept of the subject or 
the existence of the individual self.  Identity is a question that focuses on a person's 'self' as part of a community 
becomes important.   Identity is often thought to be something inherent in the individual.  It is then read or 
identified either by himself or by others.  Identity can be instantly in a person.  This means that identity is attached 
because of the grace of God, such as gender, skin color, and body shape.  However, identity also exists in the form 
of the result of formation during the individual's life, for example culture, class, his role in daily life (regarding 
his profession or status).  Therefore the identity attached to the individual is never singular and can be capricious. 
Richard Jenkins argues that social identity is our understanding of who we are and who others are, and 
reciprocally, others in understanding themselves and understanding others.  Identity is something that can be 
negotiated and shaped in the process of human interaction. For Jenkins, the question of identity is a question of 
meaning, and it is socially constructed (in Haralambos and Holborn, 2000: 921). This study sought to look at 
another identity issue, namely the identity of people with disabilities. Studies of""disability""or  difable or disability 
as part of identity studies are still rare.  Even in the study of the world of work, although people with disabilities 
experienced a growth in portion count, when compared to other aspects (e.g. based on race, ethnicity, or gender), 
attention to people with disabilities is still relatively small (McLaughlin et al. 2004). 
Society's general negative and longstanding view of people suffering from disabilities can actually curb their 
mental as well as mobility.  Usually those who feel themselves disabled are overshadowed by irrational anxiety, 
easily discouraged and humiliated, and the future is felt dark (Kartono, 1983). In addition, Prasadio stated that 
people who are considered disabled are distinguished from normal people, so that the body or mental state of a 
person who is not normal gives birth to views or attitudes of society that are often negative towards their existence. 
Therefore, those with disabilities are often the forgotten group (Prasadio, 1982).  This problem becomes more

radically;   Third,stigma imposed on the basis of tribal, racial, national, and religious. Based on this research, the 
stigma in question is the first type of stigma, namely hatred of the body, the form of body abnormalities or physical 
disability. This is seen from the data obtained, especially related to marginalization in terms of employment, there 
are still companies that avoid hiring people with disabilities. The cause is the stigma that disabled people are 
unable to work properly and the laboratory, the performance of those with disabilities is considered not to be as 
good as a 'normal' person. In addition, the notion that disabled people are only fit to work behind the scenes and 
not fit to be employed in the front office also still dominates the stigma about disabled people in public spaces. 
The front office requires people who look attractive so it is considered that the presence of a disabled person in 
the front office will be detrimental to the company or office.  
 
In addition to these three concepts of stigma, Goffman also divides stigma based on stigmatization or knowedge 
of others over the stigma that one has, among others: First,stigma discredit, namely 'deficiencies' or differences 
owned by someone known by others. For example physical disabilities that can be seen visually;   
Second,discreditable stigma, i.e. 'deficiencies' or differences that one has are not known by others because they 
are invisible.  For example,a homosexual. Based on goffman's concept, the study led to a discredit stigma, because 
'deficiencies' or disabilities can be known directly by others because they are visually visible. The problem is that 
when others can know directly about this physical disability, then automatically stigmatization appears. The 
perception that disabled women are the number two human being in need to come to the fore, the opportunity to 
be able to demonstrate the ability to be subordinated. Even people tend to ignore the needs of individuals to display 
their abilities to the maximum. It is precisely the compassion that arises as a form of stigma against this disabled 
woman. Instead of giving them a chance, they shut down the opportunity.  
 
6. Conclusion 
People with disabilities are  part of society and they are a  minority group in terms of numbers  and  subordinated 
in terms of position. They are seen as anomalies, outside of normalcy, this causes them to be positioned 
unfavorably, they are viewed as poor and marginalized. This  is in contrast to the growing stigma in society that 
disability is a disgrace, an evil, one that should be avoided  that gives rise to compassion and supposition of 
incompetence. 
 
The stigma about disability causes society to also view people with disabilities as weak, helpless, unable to do 
anything, have no job, no hope, as people who should be pitied, as people who are 'lacking',incomplete, and not 
perfect creatures. The negative stigma is so attached to people with disabilities, sometimes even forcing people 
with disabilities to 'become' as perceived by society. That is, if people with disabilities are considered weak, then 
the community (audience) expects people with disabilities to behave or look weak, because that is how they are 
constructed. This is what Goffman calls  virtual social identity,which is the demand about how an actor(with a 
disability) is required to behave or display his identity. While in  the self-disabled  themselves, there is a desire to 
show what he is actually able to do, contrary to what society considers their abilities. What people with disabilities 
are actually able to do is what Goffman calls  the real social identity in the whole  self as part of the way they 
construct their identity. 
 
Disabled women are becoming increasingly subordinated, traditional and patriarchal views on women demand 
that women meet the criteria of 'perfect' women in society, but when women are disabled, the position of 
subordination turns into highly-subordination. Disabled women are increasingly being compressed, not only by 
society, even from their own families, and also from another ‘normal’ women.

Abstract 
The political reformation in Indonesia has become an important mainstay of rural developments. Through the 
Rural Act, Indonesia's central government considers developing a village-based economy by disbursing village 
funds alongside by establishment of a Village-Owned Public Agency (Badan Umum Milik Desa). That idealism 
yet leaves much noteworthy criticism as exemplified by the existence of backward villages, impoverishments, and 
the demise of Village-Owned Public Agency issues that remain neglected. To the exception, both Sambirejo 
Village in Sleman and Kutuh Village in Badung have shown a contrast presage to which considered as an impotent 
village. Those villages categorize as unicorn villages with an income of over IDR one billion per year. As 
researchers, we decide to choose the previously-mentioned villages as a subject of our research in the field of 
political pillar studies. Applying qualitative research methods, we analyze political pillars through the Theory of 
Power (relational power) which incorporates governance actor market actors. By this article, we persist to 
explicate how actors and its relational power influence the rural development process by using the highest region's 
own source revenue (Pendapatan Asli Daerah or PADes). Thereafter we try to identify the best practices of rural 
development innovations. To sum up, the success factor of rural developments is the results of villages’ 
governance intersectionality with various sectors and stakeholders, through the dint of rural tourism 
developments.

1. Introduction
The enactment of Rural Law Number 6 of 2014 shifts the village’s political landscape, which prior integrated into 
local government regulations. In the aftermath, villages in Indonesia will co-opt wider space to upscale their 
authority, restructure the village administration, and gain more village funding sources. Since 2015, villages in 
Indonesia earn the disbursement of 1.4 billion rupiahs per year (Puspasari 2016). The provision of village funds 
has become a form of central government's aid as many villages in Indonesia entangle to poverty. Hence, it is 
necessary to increase the funding allocation for villages (Lewis 2015; Yusuf et al. 2019; Karim 2020). Through 
the regency government, village funds will be useful as a form of fiscal transfer to the resource management at 
the village and regency levels, as well as providing poverty eradication programs (Watts et al. 2019). 
The shift of village autonomy still bears negative consequences inherited by the New Order’s centralized and 
interventionist policies (Antlöv 2003). After the advent of the Reformation, the local government seems to elude 
the central intervention; by means to assemble more inclusive and autonomous governance (Taufani and Iswanto 
2018; Kristiansen and Santoso 2006). By decentralized government, it will provide extensive authority to the local 
government's autonomy itself (Riggs et al. 2016). This economic increment illustrates to which the decrease in 
power at a higher level of government provides wider opportunities for the local government to regulate at its own 
pace (Kushandajani and Alfirdaus 2019; Sahide et al. 2016; Vel et.al. 2017). At the post decentralization, stock-
still, it remains to leave the question of whether that immense amount of fundings have succeeded to transform 
all Indonesian villages into a better place by Law 6/2014. Thus, we would observe those funding distributions to 
the credit of Law 6/2014. Referring to the Indonesian Village Development Index (IDM) in 2020, there are 3,535 
of the most undeveloped villages, 17,541 undeveloped villages, 38,019 developing villages, 8,692 developed 
villages and 839 villages consider as independent (idm.kemendesa.go.id). Besides, the rate of poverty also shows 
a decreasing trend. According to Statistics Indonesia’s data by March 2015, the poverty rate in the village was 
17.94 percent, while in September 2020 shows a decrement to 13.20 percent (bps.go.id). By the village funding 
distributions, the percentage of poor in Indonesia villages has decreased by 4.74 percent, even in the midst of a 
COVID-19 pandemic situation.

Through the excerpts of the interview, it appears that the assessment of the community's role in tourism progress 
is not institutionalized but is more valued as a socio-cultural part. For the Traditional Village government, the 
community's contribution can be seen from how the community works together to maintain the existence of Kutuh 
Village with its culture and rituals. From the ritual values that place the asset zone well built by the community. 
Culture for the Balinese people, has indeed become part of their identity, they believe that cultural development 
will affect aspects of life. Therefore, it is necessary to preserve the nation's culture with creativity and develop it 
following progress (Satiada, 2003). With this the nation's culture develops and is sustainable without losing its 
roots (Mantra, 1996). 
 
Indigenous peoples have a strong position in the preservation and rotation of the life cycle of the Kutuh village 
because all assets owned, both land ownership, are in the name of the customary village. It's just that people who 
occupy customary lands have an obligation as an activity committee at the temple. Balinese people often call it 
Ayahan Desa, which is a work obligation to manage places of worship. The challenge faced by the traditional 
village government is how to change the mindset of the people who used to leave their land just like that so that 
it becomes land that can be efficient and generate income for the community and village. This background begins 
with people's ignorance of how to manage business professionally. In this regard, the Head of the Traditional 
Village then gives directions to the community. 
 
Another thing that the customary village government does to the community is to change the behavior of the 
community through power – what used to be farmers are now people's servants. The change in mindset 
(knowledge) that needs to be instilled in the community is how to serve living beings with various characters who 
used to only serve the dead. So they seek to cultivate new knowledge as a tourist servant. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The tourism sector is growing and developing well in both study locations. The growth and development of this 
sector is supported by the work of governance actors with unique dynamics in each village. Each research location, 
both in Sambirejo Village and Kutuh Village, has a different socio-cultural background. Sambirejo, which is 
located in the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY), owns the land owned by Sultan Hamengkubohuno. While in 
Kutuh Village, which is in Bali Province, there are two leaderships in one village, namely the leadership of the 
Traditional Village and the leadership of the Service Village. The socio-cultural context that characterizes each 
location becomes the color in the context of their government and policy making. 
 
Governance actors in the two study villages played a role in village development, thus contributing to the high 
income of the village. However, the dominant role appears to be in the hands of each village government, namely 
the village government in Sambirejo and the customary village government in Kutuh. The majority of community 
and private involvement did not come from their own initiatives but came from village government initiatives in 
each location. Especially the relationship between the village government and the community looks asymmetrical, 
with the dominance of the Village Government which relies on the leadership quality of the village government. 
However, even though they are asymmetrical, this condition has succeeded in bringing both villages into the 
unicorn category. In Sambirejo Village - especially at the Tebing Breksi tourist location - the institutionalization 
of tourist villages is manifested in BUMDes formed by the village government, Pokdarwis formed by the district 
government, Village Economic Center which was inaugurated by the central government and Lowok Ijo which is 
a local community group. In Kutuh Village, the institutionalization of tourism villages is manifested through 
BUMDA and BUMDes where both are the result of the intertwining of the authorities of the actors in the duality 
of leadership led by the Traditional Village Head and Perbekel (Head of Village Service). 
 
Apart from the village government, development in the two villages cannot be separated from the role of supra-
village governments such as district/city governments, provincial governments and the central government. This 
study found that the provincial government had a greater contribution than the district government in the two 
villages. This can be seen from the policy and infrastructure support by the DIY Provincial Government for 
Sambirejo Village, as well as capital loan support through the LPD by the Bali Provincial Government for Kutuh 
Village. Meanwhile, the role of the district government in both locations does not appear significant. However, 
although the role of each actor is not the same in supporting the realization of a tourist village, the relations and 
roles between the governance actors are always dynamic. 
 
In terms of development success, the focus of development in the tourism sector has not only succeeded in 
showing output but also succeeded in showing positive development outcomes. One of these outcomes are shown 
through their ability to empower the residents' economy, not only internally from their respective villages but also 
residents from other villages. However, this development outcome certainly needs to be investigated more deeply 
considering that first, the rural communities in both locations are agricultural communities with a subsistence

economic background. Subsequently, we would like to observe the shift of community relationships after the 
development of tourism villages. Those income aspects obtained from the tourism sector also contributes to the 
service sector of the local village government. By those incomes, it covers on how vulnerable groups (such as the 
elderly, women, children, disabilities and poor groups) are empowered in village government policies. Both of 
these can be directions for future research.

Abstract 
Patronage has become more massive since the change in the electoral system to open proportionality. This article 
discusses variations in the practice of political patronage incumbents and new legislative candidates for the 2019 
General Election from the perspective of political sociology. Data was collected by using candidate shadowing 
techniques, interviews with legislative candidates, success teams and voters. Primary-secondary data were 
analyzed and then interpreted qualitatively in depth. The results of the study indicate a tendency to shift from 
active legislative candidates to voters through brokers or successful teams. Giving to voters is interpreted as a 
political charity, goods are positioned as symbols of attention and service as a bonus. Contribution of research in 
the context of patronage variations and the concept of political alms, active voters. In addition, the strategy of 
sharing votes in one family, if receiving money from several candidates. The factor of the amount of money, 
proximity to the candidate becomes the basis of choice. So that the practice of patronage does not guarantee the 
electability of candidates. Political patronage has broad implications, apart from damaging the image of 
democracy, it also fosters the practice of money politics and corruption.

1. Introduction
The reformation era is expected to give birth to a government that is free from corrupt practices through 
democratic elections. However, from the 1999 to 2019 elections, they have not been able to present legislative 
members who are free from political corruption practices. The failure of substantive democratic practices, not 
only because of the morality problem of politicians and voters, but also by an open proportional electoral system 
(open list). This system has opened up opportunities for fierce and even brutal contestation between candidates. 
Opportunities for candidate electability are no longer based on the acquisition of party votes, but more importantly 
the votes acquired by each candidate. In addition, the political practices of the reform era are also marked by the 
image of politicians (Piliang, 2011, Mujani et al, 2010 and Taqwa, 2013). 
The open proportional electoral system has consequences for the contestation between candidates. Previously, 
there were competitors between parties, not between parties but also between candidates, both candidates between 
parties and between candidates in the same party. In addition to technical election problems which still leave many 
problems, there are also issues of political practice that nullify the spirit of democracy, namely transactional 
politics which are almost evenly carried out by legislative candidates, both at the district and national levels. 
Knowing the patronage practices and the amount of funds spent can be an indication of rampant post-election 
corruption practices. Political corruption motives for DPR (People's Representative Council) and DPRD 
(Regional People's Representative Assembly) members are to return the expensive costs incurred in the election 
(Riwanto, 2015: 89). By knowing the variations and how political patronage operations in the field can at least 
provide an overview of the rampant practices of political corruption after the legislative elections. So there are 
many political implications in the future, as the political impact of this money. 
The above conditions have provided an open space for the practice of political patronage which has become a 
global phenomenon in developing countries. This is indeed a lot happening in countries where people are not yet 
mature in democracy, such as in the countries of the African continent (Bamidele and Titeca, 2006). People in 
developing democratic countries still hope to get instant and definite benefits, rather than long-term benefits that 
have not been guaranteed. The same is true of a number of cities in Latin American countries. Even the practice 
of political patronage has had a broad impact, the formation of socio-economic structures in society (Menes, 
2019).

This massive patronage practice will have a wide impact, including the proliferation of corruption practices after 
the election, because the legislative candidates try hard to return political funds during the campaign. This is in 
line with the research of Menes (tt) and Muhtadi (2013). Likewise, research by Riwanto (2015: 89) states that the 
motive for political corruption by DPR and DPRD members is to return the expensive costs incurred during 
elections. 
 
Patronage practices have an impact on people's mindset, especially meaning that democratic principles have been 
contaminated in patronage practices. The voice of conscience of a person in the form of pure aspiration can be 
purchased for the sake of interest. So it is this deflection of demands for conscience which can be called a crime. 
Another aspect of political ethics is the giving of money to the people in the hope that the election of certain 
political parties will have an impact on political education, namely mobilization which in turn clogs political 
participation. People in a process like this remain the object of political exploitation by those in power. 
 
The emergence of social inequality with the existence of patronage practices between the rich and the poor because 
only people who have financial capital can serve in the government and in the absence of good political capacity, 
problems such as corruption will arise. If the patronage continues, it is certain that the world of politics will 
become increasingly damaged. Procedural democracy will only become the ground for mediocre people, namely 
those who do not have sufficient performance, to gain power. It is even possible that procedural democracy will 
be exploited by those who have an unstoppable desire and greed to control state assets. Therefore, they do all 
kinds of ways to gain power. This power will later be used to return the money that has been used to obtain office. 
In fact, he will be used to get wealth many times over. For this reason, patronage must be considered a major 
crime in politics that must be fought and eliminated together. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that the massive political patronage practice is considered a 
habit of politicians and the public, whether it is the provision of money, goods (basic food), services and services, 
both incumbent and new candidates, all of them practice patronage, except for one candidate only with goods. 
Meanwhile, service patronage and business opportunities are limited to incumbent candidates, because they 
already have political capital, particularly bargaining power with the executive. The incumbent also has power, 
so it is easy to recruit other people to work with him. However, the incumbent candidates who have contributed, 
if they do not give money, will not be elected by the citizens. Giving money creates opportunities, and the money 
seems to have just become a ticket, like the dowry of a candidate in the post-conflict local election. There are 
concerns from the legislative candidates that if they do not conduct patronage, there will be no chance of being 
elected as a member of the council. Giving is not necessarily chosen, especially if you don't give at all. 
 
Voters almost all received money, apart from goods that were later called ""political alms (sedekah politik)"". Apart 
from the concept of political almsgiving as an invention, the amount of funds for candidates per electoral and per 
voter issued by candidates and how the process reaches the voters is also a finding and novelty. Likewise, the 
strategy of voters in one family to divide votes based on the amount of money received by candidates or timses is 
also a novelty of this research. 
 
There is a tendency for voters to receive multiple gifts, in addition to receiving double alms, money politics, also 
receiving goods, while hoping to get a job or service. Even those who think that money is a ""proposal"", while the

giving of goods is a ""sign"". Furthermore, there are still others who hope that after the election they will receive a 
""bonus"" in the form of work or other services. 
 
Interesting further research between political patronage in the presidential election and regional head elections, 
whether the patronage patterns have similarities and differences and political patronage patterns in the elections 
for regional heads and village heads. Is there a tandem collaboration between the candidates for the Regency 
DPRD and the Provincial DPRD or National Legislative Candidates (DPR) including in the distribution of 
political patronage, how does the patronage work in a tandem system (collaboration between candidates in stages).

Abstract 
Social enterprise towards community empowerment are commonly developed as poverty alleviation strategies by 
combining community, corporates, and government strengths and initiatives. The development of social enterprise in 
Indonesia has rapidly grown over recent years. In the middle of covid-19 pandemic influences the uncertainty 
condition to keep the business able to survive. In this disadvantaged situation, many social enterprise organizations 
face vulnerability situations regarding problems and challenges that occurred. However, some social enterprises can 
survive by facing the challenges into opportunities. Thus, developing some strategies becomes the best choice for 
resilience. The study conducts a qualitative method by focusing on in-depth interviews by using interviews, literature 
studies, and social media documentation. This study aims to describe the challenges, opportunities, and strategies of 
the best practices from three social enterprise organizations in Indonesia. The finding reveals that multi-stakeholders 
including government, higher education institutions, media, other companies, and local communities finally able to 
encourage the social enterprise organizations in formulating and implementing the strategies to strengthen their 
resilience during the pandemic.

1. Introduction
Social enterprise emerged to address the pressing social challenges by targeting primarily the social impact rather than 
profit maximation. Organization Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that it brings innovation in 
meeting social needs and operates on the basis of social inclusion and sustainable growth (OECD & European 
Commission 2013). A similar endorsement is given by the European Union arguing that social enterprise help in 
achieving wider social, environmental, and community objectives. It also creates jobs and supports democratic 
participation.  
There is yet a single legal form on social enterprise, however, the European Commission refers to social enterprise to 
cover the following characteristic (European Commission & OECD 2015). First, the aim of commercial activity is to 
provide common good or societal objectives. Therefore, social innovation is a unique characteristic of this type of 
enterprise Second, the profit gained is reinvested to achieve the societal objectives. Lastly, the organization of social 
enterprise adopts a participatory principle that highlights democratic participation that focuses on social justice. These 
characteristics distinguished social enterprise from the rest and strengthen their valuable contribution toward social 
inclusion.

6. Conclusion 
This study showed challenges that emerged during the covid-19 pandemic. However, these situations were responded 
as the opportunities to strengthen the resiliency through formulating some strategies. Based on the best practice we 
learned through these three social enterprise organizations towards community empowerment, their resilience 
resources include the community-market sustainability, digital technology adaptation, and multi-stakeholders’ 
collaboration involving the local community, government, media, higher education, and partnerships with the other 
companies. Furthermore, the strategies are modified towards all sectors to create adaptation and innovation in response 
to the challenges and opportunities during the unpredictable situations or crises.  
Also, based on the findings and discussions, it is essential for social enterprise organizations to put in concerns on the 
resources availability for developing the networks. This paper contributes to the idea that local community becomes 
the essential source for maintaining the social enterprise organization social benefit during the crises. However, the 
other significances are related to initiating the adaptive strategies rather than waiting for the assistances or help from 
other sources. This action would be the best choice to develop the organization resilience in economic and social 
uncertainty. Also, social enterprise organizations may develop their role for bridging the collaboration between the 
stakeholders to deliver the wider social benefit for the community. However, a limitation of this study was only based 
on a small sample of recruited participants from the best practice social enterprise organizations making this research 
finding difficult to generalize. Therefore, there is necessary to study larger samples recruited as the representative 
population. Another limitation of this study was only captured in the limited period during covid-19 pandemic. 
Therefore, to capture the nature of social resilience of the organizations, longitudinal studies are expected to provide 
deeper and more valuable insights.

Abstract 
This study aims to analyze the importance of clean and healthy public toilet to the development of amenities in 
Surakarta tourist destinations using Structural Functional theory. The target of this explorative research consisted of 
tourism stakeholders in Surakarta. Observation, in-depth interview and focus group discussion were used as techniques 
of collecting data. Interactive analysis model was used to analyze the data. Toilet is needed for promoting the tourism 
and a part of sanitation and service; thus tourism stakeholders’ treatment and responsible commitment to clean and 
healthy toilet are required in tourist destination. Toilet facilities and accessories are public facilities to support tourist 
attractions. The clean and healthy toilet revitalizing program is compatible to trend tourists currently, because 
sanitation and health factors are important to improve the tourists’ trust.  
Keywords 
Revitalization, Public Toilet, Amenities, Health, Tourist Destination. 
1. Introduction
Indonesian tourism is the promising superior sector to Indonesian people before Covid-19 pandemic era, but in fact it 
in worse condition due to the lowering economic ability and the decreasing number of global tourist visits. The Travel 
and Tourism Competitiveness Report released by World Economic Forum in 2019 shows that Indonesian tourism’s 
competitiveness in the world increases from 42nd to 40th ranking in 2017. The pillars valued are business environment, 
safety, health and sanitation, human resource and job opportunity, environmental sustainability and etc. hygiene pillar 
is an aspect improved and valued good by Indonesia (Camilleri, 2018; Firdaus et al, 2020).   
Toilet symbolizes amenity, service, and modern civilization. Without a good clean toilet, perception on tourist object 
and attraction’s amenity and beauty will fall down. As an indicator of tourism, toilet should be proper, with its fulfilled 
need for water and cleanliness according to standard foreign guest (Wilkinson et al, 1995; Sang, 2017). However, the 
condition of toilet has not been proper in various Indonesian tourist objects and attractions. Even a global survey 
shows that Indonesian toilets score 40 out of scale 100. Meanwhile, toilet is a very important facility to foreigners. 
Therefore, the organizer of tourist objects and attractions pay more attention to toilet condition. The condition of toilet 
should actually be comfortable and clean not only in tourist destinations but also in people’s houses entirely.   
In recent years, tourism industry has been an extraordinary global phenomenon. Some reports released by Global and 
national institutions state that this industry becomes the largest one, viewed from geographical spread, growth, 
interrelation to other industry, labor, and economic coverage generated. In the last 25 years, UNWTO records tourist 
journey growth by 500%. The fact within society shows the shift in need for tour. Having tour constituting primary 
need some years ago now shifts to secondary need. Having tour also represents an individual’s social status within 
society. Such phenomena indicate that tourism has been promising giant industry today and in the following years. 
Considering the phenomena, government, private, and people should begin prepare well and correctly the aspects 
underlying this industry creation.   
Generally, tourism industry is a combination of product and service. The consumers of tourism industry, usually called 
tourist, buy not only products like food, beverage, and souvenir, but also experience with how they enjoy the tourist 
destination. Even, the products including tourist attraction, hotel room, and plane seat sold purely are service, because 
tourist may enjoy them only but they may not bring them home.

condition of toilet in tourist object is not only the real implementation of religion tenet mentioning that cleanliness is 
a part of faith. An approach should be taken to make toilets in tourist object in high quality. So the phrase “cleanliness 
is a part of faith” is not merely lip service, but it should be proven that tourist object is a clean, safe, and comfortable 
place. Indonesian tourism will not revive and incapable of selling high quality and sustainable tourism with low quality 
toilet. Destination will not be a priority, when it has low-quality toilet.  
 
The existence of toilet in tourist objects and attractions are an important part of tourists’ need not only to defecate but 
to do some other things. This public facility should be managed as well as possible by tourist destination provider by 
considering some aspects:  saving, making healthy, securing, comforting, and facilitating both users and providers.  
 
The tourists who have ever visited a tourist destination are surely aware of the public toilet-related problems existing 
in tourist object. The problem is related to the cleanliness of public toilet or called hygiene and sanitation of public 
toilet. Public toilet in tourist objects is important because this facility indicates personality or self identity of nation or 
surrounding community. The visiting tourists will view the surrounding people from the cleanliness of public toilet. 
It is because every tourist will think that tourist object providers, in this case surrounding people, have failed in creating 
a clean public toilet. Moreover, if the tourists are foreigners, the provider of tourist object will feel shy with the non-
well-managed toilet because foreign tourists have bad experience and they will tell others in their state about it. The 
management of public toilet in tourist objects, particularly in Surakarta, still belongs to low category. The providers 
of tourist object and people as users have low awareness of the importance of public toilet.  
 
The provider of tourist destinations in Surakarta state that there are some reasons why the management of public toilet 
is still poor in tourist objects in Surakarta: limited fund to build public toilet, people’s poor knowledge on how to 
manage public toilet, and high cost of public toilet development and treatment, and public toilet users’ low awareness 
of using it duly. In addition, socialization has not been made adequately about the knowledge on the importance of 
public toilet cleanliness, government has not paid maximum attention to the facility of public toilet, and clean water 
is not available or available in limited amount.     
 
Three aspects important to consider in managing public toilet in tourist destination: profitability, sustainability, and 
acceptability to local people. The management system selected should be profitable to the providers, as it becomes the 
main appeal to the provider to be willing to manage the toilet. It should also be able to ensure routine supervision 
system; thus, the provider will do the job seriously and sustainably. Public participation, in this case people’s sense of 
belonging will be really helpful to the maintenance of toilet facilities.  Public participation highly determines whether 
or not the facilities of public toilet built by the government are actually desirable. In addition, people should be 
habituated to have clean and healthy life behavior, including in using public toilet. It can be accomplished through 
giving socialization and to appeal to family, RT (neighborhood association), RW (citizen association), kelurahan 
(village) and Tourism Service Office to change people’s life behavior into the cleaner and healthier one.  
 
4. Conclusion  
An indicator of clean, beautiful, and comfortable tourist destination is the supporting toilet. All parties should care 
about the facilities supporting tourism realm that absorb foreign tourists’ visit to Indonesia. Revitalizing activity is an 
activity of improving amenities in a number of tourist attractions, including revitalizing toilet and adding other 
facilities to support cleanliness, and tourists’ health, safety, and comfort by implementing health protocol strictly. 
Revitalization can improve the tourist destinations’ service and competitiveness. The revitalization of tourist 
destination should be adjusted with each of tourist destinations’ priority and need. Cleanliness and health are very 
important to tourists currently.

Abstract 
Young people are the next generation of the nation. The future of the nation's life is in the hands of the younger 
generation. Therefore, the spirit of nationalism is very important for the younger generation, especially young people 
in border areas. This study aims to review the nationalism of young people in the Indonesia-Malaysia border area. 
This study uses a mixed-method research method, combining quantitative and qualitative research methods. The 
quantitative descriptive in this study is a description of the variables of national, socio-economic, and political insight. 
The national insight variable consists of various indicators, namely Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, the proclamation of 
independence, the Indonesian president, the meaning of the red and white flag, the youth oath, religion in Indonesia, 
the basis of the state, and Pancasila. The socio-economic variables consist of several indicators, namely daily needs, 
food commodities, currency, social welfare, infrastructure, education, health, religious freedom, tolerance, nationality, 
and language. The political variables consist of various indicators, namely corruption, race, religion, ethnicity, 
terrorism, narcotics, militarism, smuggling, and regional leaders. While on the qualitative aspect, this research reflects 
the nationalism of young people in the border area of Sebatik Island, both from the reflection of national, socio-
economic, and political insights.  
Keywords 
Border Communities, Indonesian Identity, Sebatik Island, Youth Nationalism 
1. Introduction
Youth has an important role as one of the determinants of the subject for the achievement of national goals. The history 
of the struggle of the Indonesian nation has recorded the important role of youth starting from the Budi Utomo 
movement in 1908, the Youth Pledge in 1928, the Proclamation of Independence in 1945, the youth movement, 
students, students in 1966, up to the student movement in 1998 which has brought the Indonesian nation into a period 
of reform. Some of these moments indicate a strong relationship between nationalism and youth that often appear 
together, even now the media often connects nationalism with today's youth. Young people are starting to talk a lot 
and be talked about in the media, including social media. How nationalism is so related to youth can also be 
investigated through search engines in cyberspace. Many articles were detected that included two words, namely youth 
and nationalism (Wardhani 2013). 
Why young people? Young people are seen as figures who are in the 'becoming' phase. Young people are in a moving 
phase until they arrive at the endpoint, namely maturity (Alvian 2015). Young people are still trying to find and find 
their identity. While adults already have a fixed self-identity (Giroux 2009; Wyn and White 1997). So it is these young 
people who are vulnerable to their identity, especially their national identity, nationalism. 
On the other hand, the border area should be the foremost area because it is the front porch of the Republic of 
Indonesia, the border area should be treated specifically by the government because the front porch is seen as a sample 
of the state of the whole country, but in fact, the front porch is isolated and isolated given the limited infrastructure 
and facilities. especially access to the area, causing inequality and vulnerability to nationalism. The results of the study 
of Khoiri and Irwan (2020) that community mobility is one of the factors that causes the weakening of the sense of 
nationalism of residents living at the border. Continuous mobility can affect people's attitudes towards their sense of 
nationalism. 
The Indonesia-Malaysia border area has experienced an Indonesian identity crisis caused by several factors such as 
welfare problems, economic inequality, infrastructure, and infrastructure which are considered worse for the

the government has never been able to provide electricity alone, many roads in Sebatik District have also been 
damaged. According to them, the visits by the central government officials were fruitless, because in every visit the 
central government officials said that the state border area was the front porch, but the roads were still damaged. The 
influence of poverty on the nationalism crisis in the Sebatik District can be seen in the migration of people from 
villages in Indonesia to Malaysia and the occurrence of several crimes in the Indonesia-Malaysia border area in the 
form of human trafficking, smuggling, and illegal immigrants. 
 
There are various push and pull factors for inter-country mobility in border communities to Malaysia. In addition to 
traveling activities, close relationships, kinship, and relatives are the main socio-cultural factors for people in border 
areas who move to Malaysia. Meanwhile, the opportunity to have a more prosperous life in Malaysia is indeed an 
attractive offer for many workers to migrate or migrate to the country. Malaysia is still often seen as a country or 
region whose position is higher than Sebatik Island and even Indonesia, both economically, the level of education of 
its citizens, as well as the quality of service to its citizens. 
 
The unequal prosperity has made hundreds of young people migrate to Malaysia. There are people from the Sebatik 
Sub-district who want to move to become Malaysian citizens because so far the Indonesian government's development 
program has not reached the hamlet. They admit that they feel more comfortable being Malaysian citizens so that 
since 1990 there have been hundreds of residents in the sub-district who have moved to become Malaysian citizens. 
They turn to Malaysian citizens because of their ethnicity, pursue education, improve the economy, and seek ease of 
access. Border communities on Sebatik Island rely on products from abroad such as Malaysia to meet their daily needs 
ranging from primary, secondary, and tertiary needs. For border communities, it is commonplace to conduct economic 
transactions, buying and selling with people from outside the islands. 
 
The results of the research analysis also show that There are 2 types of Indonesian identity for youth at the border: (1) 
Change of identity type: Youth who change citizenship; (2) Split of identity type: “Garuda di dadaku macan di 
perutku” (eagle (representing Indonesia) in my chest, tiger (representing Malaysia) in my stomach). It means, their 
soul belongs to Indonesia, but their economic needs depend on Malaysia. The split of identity is divided into two 
types: (a) Youth who have one nationality but still depend on Tawau, Malaysia; (b) Youth who have dual citizenship. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The conclusion in this study is that the Indonesian identity of young people in Sebatik Indonesia has been reduced. 
Nationalism is only limited to ceremonies, not yet rooted in their souls. Many of them chose to become Malaysian 
citizens. Factors causing the reduced sense of youth nationalism at the border are for example socio-economic 
conditions, such ad the occurrence of economic inequality and other factors. This study also concludes that youth 
nationalism at the border has 2 types of identity, namely identity change and identity split. This social reflection 
reviewing the nationalism of young people in the Sebatik border area is the trigger for further studies related to 
nationalism at the border.  
 
This study contributes to both theory and practice. Theoretically, this research contributes to the field of study of youth 
nationalism at the border. This study has analyzed how the spirit of youth nationalism. Furthermore, the results can 
be used as a reference for studies related to nationalism in the future. Practically, the results of this study provide 
several recommendations for the government. The government needs to pay more attention to the future of youth at 
the border as the nation's next generation at the forefront of the NKRI. Another important insight conveyed by the 
current research is the need for a strategy to increase youth nationalism at the border through strengthening Indonesian 
identity. This research is limited to youth nationalism with the study area on Sebatik Island, North Kalimantan. 
Therefore, it is recommended to conduct furthermore comprehensive research, including national studies.

Abstract 
Research on the role of religious leaders in HIV / AIDS prevention and control has not been widely carried out in 
Indonesia. This study aims to map the role of religious leaders in the prevention and control of HIV / AIDS in Malang 
as the city with the second highest number of HIV / AIDS sufferers in East Java. This study showed that religious 
leaders have not had any concrete efforts to prevent and control HIV / AIDS among their followers nor having deep 
knowledge about HIV/AIDS itself. However, these religious leaders always remind their followers to stay away from 
free sex (adultery) in order to avoid sin and ugliness in the world, which can actually be used as part of efforts to 
prevent the spread of HIV / AIDS in society. Through spirituality cultivation, religious leaders can function as the first 
bastion in preventing HIV / AIDS. Religion can also be used as a means of overcoming the stigma experienced by 
PLWHA through teaching people to return to religious teachings (repent). Unfortunately, this effort was not seen by 
the government or related parties so that these religious leaders were not directly involved in HIV / AIDS prevention 
and control in Malang City even though they were willing to be involved by the government to do so.

Role, Religious Leader, Prevention And Management, and HIV/AIDS. 
1. Introduction
HIV / AIDS is an infectious disease that has received special attention both on a global and national scale. Based on 
UNAIDS data, the number of people with HIV / AIDS worldwide is 36.9 million people per year. Indonesia, as 
reported by the UN Agency for AIDS UNAIDS in 2014, is a contributor to 23 percent of new infections in the Asia 
Pacific and is said to be in the third place as a region with a total number of HIV / AIDS sufferers of 5.2 million people 
(Azanella, 2018). With the high number of HIV / AIDS sufferers, HIV / AIDS in Indonesia is more perceived as a 
moral and social issue than a medical issue, this is one of the causes of the strong stigma that people with HIV / AIDS 
receive in society and an inhibiting factor for acceleration. HIV / AIDS prevention and control. 
In the process of forming these perceptions, religion plays a very important role in determining the direction of public 
perceptions of people with HIV / AIDS. The important role of religion in shaping perceptions has not yet become an 
important topic in Indonesia. In addition, the direction of government policies and the involvement of key parties in 
Indonesia in accelerating the handling and control of HIV / AIDS were mostly carried out with a medical approach 
rather than religion even though Indonesia had signed a Declaration of Commitment on HIV-AIDS at the Special 
Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGASS) where One of the priority programs is to prevent HIV / AIDS by 
adopting a religious approach (UGM, 2015; Indonesia, 2002). 
The important role of religion, especially religious leaders, as parties who have the authority and authority in 
determining religious discourse in the prevention and control of HIV / AIDS has not become a priority in Indonesia. 
Apart from the fact that multi-sectoral involvement, including the involvement of religious leaders, has recently taken 
a new direction in the national HIV / AIDS prevention and control policy in Indonesia, HIV / AIDS has not become 
a discourse that is considered important in the discussion of religion itself in Indonesia. Although efforts have been 
made to involve religious leaders in the fight against HIV / AIDS in Indonesia by providing advocacy capacity training 
for cadres of Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama, two of the largest Islamic organizations in Indonesia, which was 
implemented in 5 cities, the continuity of this training is in the effort of engagement. community carrying out HIV / 
AIDS prevention and control has not yet been reviewed (AUSAID, 2009).

According to one informant, it requires synergy not only from religious leaders if the intention is to reduce the social 
problems of the spread of HIV / AIDS, but requires the integration of all elements from the government, religious 
leaders, families, educational institutions, etc. However, as with other religions, there has never been an official report 
or data on the number of HIV / AIDS sufferers among Hindus so that prevention and control of HIV / AIDS among 
Hindu religious leaders has not become a priority. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The leaders of five religions in Malang City have the same opinion regarding the causes of HIV / AIDS, where the 
five of them associate HIV / AIDS with free sex behavior which is considered deviant and sinful behavior by all 
religions, although there are many factors of HIV / AIDS transmission. These religious leaders then provide guidance 
to their followers through sermons or lectures or recitation so that their followers stay away from free sex. This effort 
can indirectly become an effort to prevent HIV / AIDS transmission based on spiritual or spiritual strengthening carried 
out by religious leaders. 
 
Unfortunately, the lack of knowledge about the spread of HIV / AIDS, which is caused by the lack of involvement of 
religious leaders and religious organizations in the prevention and control of HIV / AIDS by the government and the 
absence of reports on PLHIV among their respective religious communities has led to religious leaders and religious 
organizations in Malang City has not made HIV / AIDS a priority problem that needs to be resolved. In fact, religious 
leaders can become strategic actors in HIV / AIDS prevention precisely through their teachings to stay away from free 
sex and to fully accept the repentance of people who violate the teachings of God's religion, this can be a way to reduce 
the stigma of PLWHA in society.

Abstract 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has been one of the significant factors in supply chain disruptions worldwide, and research 
in this domain has gained considerable attention during the last few years. However, it is crucial to understand the 
amount of attention each industry and problem gets to improve the quality of future research and identify research 
gaps. In this literature survey, 574 research papers from the Scopus database were retrieved and pre-processed to 
perform the analyses. A bibliometric study using keywords was conducted to unveil the various research themes in 
the current literature related to supply chains and Covid-19. Moreover, topic modelling was implemented using 
abstracts to contrast the results from the bibliometric analysis. From the studies, the frequent research streams are 
identified, clustered, and discussed. Moreover, future research avenues are highlighted. Additionally, it can be 
observed that both methodologies complement each other. On one side, the bibliometric study provides a broad 
perspective of the topics; on the other side, the modelling reveals more detailed themes. Hence, researchers could 
employ both approaches simultaneously when performing an analysis of the state-of-the-art to present an enriched 
research panorama. This study also highlights the use of both methods to accelerate the review process and attain 
better insights.

Abstract 
The adoption of Industry 4.0 is considered to significantly increase the productivity and efficiency of the 
manufacturing industry in Indonesia and contribute to the national GDP to encourage global competitiveness. 
Currently, many measuring tools are used to assess the industry 4.0 readiness in various countries but using different 
aspects of the assessment. With a comparative analysis, this article will discuss the readiness of Industry 4.0 in a 
company that is measured using three different Industry 4.0 readiness measurement tools to find their similarities.

Readiness Index 4.0 (INDI 4.0) with five assessment pillars consisting of management and organization, people and 
culture, smart products and services, smart technology, and factory operations; IMPULS with six assessment pillars 
such as employees, strategy and organization, smart factories, smart operations, smart products, and data-driven 
services; and Smart Industry Readiness Index (SIRI) with three building blocks covering processes (operation supply 
chain and product life cycle pillars), technology (pillars of automation, connectivity, and intelligence) and organization 
(pillars of talent readiness and structure & management). The measurement results show that the company obtained 
an INDI score of 3.47 (level 4 or mature stage), got an IMPULS score of 3.663 (level 4 or ""Expert"" and entered the 
Leader category), and obtained a SIRI score of 1.2037. The calculation of normality with the baseline using the INDI 
4.0 score by adding one pillar in the form of Data-driven Services is carried out so that the assessment pillars are 
similar, considering that there are differences in the range of scores and levels of the three readiness measuring tools. 
Although the value of Industry 4.0 readiness in a company measured using three readiness measuring tools shows 
different scores, the three tools indicate that the company has a similar level of readiness: the ""mature"" level.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry in Indonesia has an essential role in national economic growth. This strategic sector has 
proven to be a driving force for the national economy, contributing to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 
around 20.61 percent (Statistics Indonesia, 2020). In 2018 the Government formulated the Making Indonesia 4.0

5. Conclusion 
The results of the comparative analysis to measure the Industry 4.0 readiness of PT G using three different measuring 
tools show different scores on each pillar that have been validated based on the normalization of scores against the 
baseline. This is due to differences in the assessment elements in each pillar of the measuring tools. However, the 
three measuring tools show that the company is at the same maturity level: mature (Expert) in implementing Industry 
4.0. 
 
By comparing the level of readiness of the same company with different measuring tools, the advantages of each 
measuring tool used by the company in developing its business can be seen. At the same time, the shortcomings of 
the measuring tools used today can be complemented by other measuring tools

Abstract 
Consumer demands and global competition continuously increase, compelling South African food manufacturers to 
constantly improve resource efficiency and quality. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is a program aimed at 
equipment effectiveness. While TPM can improve maintenance aspects of equipment, food manufacturers are also 
mandated to implement a Total Quality Management system (TQM), often requiring the same resources and skill set 
as TPM. This paper aimed to investigate the impact of TPM on the organizational performance of a food 
manufacturing company while identifying TQM synergies and common barriers to success. The researchers aimed to 
work towards a practical model for successful TPM implementation for companies facing similar challenges. A large 
multi-national company was used as the population and 12 of its factories were used as a sample. The 12 factories 
represented a diverse yet representative mix of food-producing plants. Quantitative data collection and analysis were 
used to understand the impact of TPM and its core construct, i.e., Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), on 
performance. Subsequently, a qualitative case study analysis was done to deliver an understanding beyond the data, 
identifying barriers to success and opportunities. The results indicated that TPM implementation in a food 
manufacturing environment does not necessarily lead to an increase in OEE. There is insufficient evidence to suggest 
that OEE can be used as a predictor of performance in productivity. 
Keywords

manufacturing. 
1. Introduction
Manufacturers are continuously challenged by unpredictable global economic conditions, more demanding customers 
and growing competition. This scenario is no different for South African food producers. (Nakajima, 1998) stated that 
manufacturing organizations need to focus on low-cost structures, improved resource utilization, superior quality, and 
the flexible and dependable delivery of products. These focus points are required to meet the customers’ expectations 
and ensure a long-term sustainable business (Huang et al., 2003).  
Slack and Brandon-Jones (Slack et al., 2018) proposed that manufacturing can contribute to organizational success by 
reducing costs, decreasing waste, improving productivity, and increasing service dependability. Globally, 
manufacturers have managed to accomplish this through the application of world-class manufacturing practices (Diaz-
Reza et al.). A myriad of continuous improvement interventions has been implemented in the manufacturing sector 
with varying degrees of success (Beardsell et al., 1999). Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Total Quality 
Management (TQM) are management systems that can be used as a supportive framework for implementing world-
class manufacturing principles.  
TPM has demonstrated that it can positively impact on productivity, quality and costs (Afefy,2003, Ahuja et al., 2008 
and Yusuf et al., 2007). Konecny and Thun (Philipp et al., 2011) further argue that manufacturers needed to pay 
attention to the reliability of their production processes. When striving for manufacturing excellence, TPM alone can 
thus contribute to productivity, but it is seldom applied in isolation.

Leadership and management need to spend more time understanding the concept of TPM and TQM and use it in their 
everyday working lives. This will show commitment and provide them with a better understanding of the barriers 
faced by the frontline teams. Management will also witness first-hand how their investments provide returns to the 
company and the unlocked potential in TPM and TQM. Viewing the organization as a system, with elements 
interacting with each other, may provide leadership with the insight to effectively use the scarce resources required 
for TPM and TQM. An understanding of the system archetype, and possible unintended consequences, are important 
to the success of the organization. From the research results, it is clear that the shared, albeit limited, resources in the 
training and development area may adversely impact on the implementation of both TPM and TQM.

Abstract 
The expected objective of this research is to determine and analyze the effect of Village Fund Allocation and Village 
Fund Allocation on improving the welfare of rural communities through performance management in the Jeneponto 
Regency. This research was conducted in 11 villages in 11 Districts in Jeneponto Regency and lasted for 
approximately 2 (two) months from January to February 2021. The population in this study were the existing Village 
Apparatus and Village Consultative Body (BPD). In 11 villages in 11 sub-Districts in Jeneponto Regency, as many as 
258 people. The sampling technique used simple random sampling, and the final sample included was 165 people. 
Data collection techniques through observation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, while data analysis 
using path analysis. The results showed that the allocation of village funds, village funds, and performance 
management encouraged increased community welfare as indicated by the rise in village community income, 
improved health, availability of savings, adequate conditions and facilities, and ease of service. Village fund allocation 
is realized through the development of village communities individually, meaning that there is empowerment, creating 
peace, serving village communities, encouraging self-reliance, and increasing village income. This is different from 
village funds intended to promote the village economy and make the community the subject of development. On the 
indirect effect, performance management is an intervening variable that can moderate both the independent and 
dependent variables. The difference in this study is the use of the variable allocation of village funds and village funds 
separately, proving that the budget allocation for the two sources of funds can have different implications in promoting 
welfare.

Positive and significant. Village funds as funds aimed at village development evenly, with the ability of stakeholders 
in managing it, will encourage better welfare improvement. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the research results, it can be concluded that a location of Village Fund, Village Fund, and Performance 
Management can encourage the improvement of community welfare. It is indicated by increasing the income of the 
village community, improving health, savings, adequate circumstances, and facilities, as well as ease of service. The 
allocation of village funds is realized through the development of individual village communities, meaning creating 
empowerment programs, creating peace, village community services, encouraging self-help, and increasing village 
income. It is different from the Village Fund, which is intended for the overall economic progress of the Village and 
makes the community the subject of development. On indirect influence, performance management as an intervening 
variable can moderate both independent variable relationships against dependents. Different things in this study are 
the use of variable Allocation of Village Funds and Village Funds separately, proving that the allocation of budgets at 
both sources of funds can have different implications in encouraging the welfare of village communities in Jeneponto 
Regency.

Based on Table 3, returns the path coefficient value (3) 0.385 with a significance level of 0.000, indicating that the 
coefficient of a meaningful path (Sig 0.05) or t-count value> t-table (6,643> 1,973). As a result, human resource 
capability variables (Y2) are said to have a positive and significant effect on the efficiency of ASN (Z). The beta value 
of the standard coefficient of 0.411 indicates the magnitude of the influence of the variable Y2 on Z., which means 
that every one-point increase in HR Capacity (Y2) will increase ASN (Z) Performance 0.385 points. 
 
The influence of human resources capacity on ASN performance at the Office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs of 
Bulukumba Regency is positive and essential. It was implying that the increase in human resource capacity will be 
accompanied by increased efficiency of ASN, if other factors that affect the potential of human resources have not 
improved. Human resource capabilities have a positive and vital impact on efficiency. The direct effects of human 
resource capabilities have a positive and critical effect on ASN efficiency, as shown by the results of the path analysis. 
The study is supported by science. According to some researchers, human resource capabilities positively and 
significantly affect ASN results (Cobanoglu 2018 ; Al dakeel and Almannie 2015; Nilsson and Ellstrom 2012; Ibrahim 
2017).  
 
The positive and significant influence shows that the higher the ability of human resources, the better the result. ASN 
at the Office of the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Bulukumba Regency. Every employee must have the ability to 
carry out the critical functions that a public organization provides them. With high performance, each employee can 
complete all organizational responsibilities quickly and efficiently, allowing them to meet predetermined goals. Each 
agency will strive to improve employee performance to achieve the agency's objectives continuously. Employee 
contributions to the company will be significant if done with positive actions and appropriate behavior (Umar 2019). 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results and discussions in this study, it can be concluded that transformational leadership variables can 
affect the performance of ASN. It is shown that employees feel in the leadership shown at the Office of Religion of 
the Ministry of Religious Affairs Bulukumba. Their leadership has a solid ideal influence, especially in taking risks 
and consistency and encouraging employees to take a new approach and appreciate their ideas, not to criticize if it is 
different from the leader's idea.   
 
The variable intervening motivation of public services and human resources capacity is also a variable that affects the 
performance of ASN, meaning not only transformational leadership that encourages the implementation of ASN but 
also the motivation of public services and human resources capacity itself. The role of intervening variables is also 
considered important in encouraging the improvement of ASN performance of the Ministry of Religious Affairs of 
Bulukumba Regency. On indirect influence, the variable motivation of public services and human resources capacity 
as intervening variables can moderate transformational leadership to ASN performance. Thus, transformational 
961","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-22, 2022

leadership can encourage public services and human resources capacity until it has an impact on improving ASN 
performance. 
 
Novelty research uses public service motivation as an intervening variable of transformational leadership to 
performance. Transformational leadership must provide a lot of stimuli personally in encouraging motivation to 
achieve understanding because, without inherently public solid service motivation, it is difficult to achieve the 
expected performance. This research contributes to enriching references to human resource management. 
 
Based on the conclusions stated above, it can be suggested as follows: It is expected the office of the Ministry of 
Religious Affairs of Bulukumba Regency. In terms of transformational leadership, further, improve the objective 
assessment of employees/staff. There is no inequality in assessing their leadership in the dimension of public service 
motivation to continue to strengthen the commitment to the public in the service because not all communities have 
the same perception in assessing employees. Also, in terms of human resources, capacity is needed to improve the 
communication network more widely to develop many more complex innovations and motivation. For the following 
research, it is expected that there will be additional independent variables that can certainly affect dependent variables 
to further enrich the study, especially in management.

Abstract 
This study intends to analyze the effectiveness of implementing social assistance spending in West Sulawesi Province 
with the enactment of the Minister of Home Affairs Regulation Number 39 of 2012. The method used in this research 
is mixed methods, namely qualitative methods using qualitative descriptive analysis methods to describe the 
effectiveness of the implementation of social assistance spending in West Sulawesi Province in 2018 (Implementation 
of Minister of Home Affairs Regulation Number 39 of 2012) as well as quantitative methods with the help of 
questionnaires distributed to West Sulawesi Provincial Government, the social assistance recipient. In this study, 
several conclusions can be drawn. Namely, the study results show that for the timeliness of the distribution of social 
assistance/grants (Bansos) in the religious sector for the community and community groups in West Sulawesi 
province, it has gone well on time. Likewise, the assistants who accompany during the distributing social 
assistance/grants (Bansos) in the religious sector show that community groups in West Sulawesi province have been 
running well, even though some people and community groups are not satisfied with the assistance. In addition, 
satisfaction with social assistance/grants (Bansos) in the religious sector for the community and community groups in 
West Sulawesi province has not been going well. This shows that the perception of the adequacy of social assistance 
funds/grants (Bansos) for the community and community groups who submit proposals, especially in the religious 
field in West Sulawesi Province, has not been as expected. In the form of money/goods, grant recipients apply for 
grant disbursement to the West Sulawesi Provincial Government with completing administrative requirements 
including 1) a letter of application; 2) has precise management; 3) NPHD (Regional Grant Agreement Manuscripts; 
4) have a registered certificate from the Ministry (SKT); and 5) domiciled in the administrative area of the relevant
regional government.

Based on the questionnaire results in the field, it can be concluded that 35 people are receiving the Social Assistance 
Grant program. The questionnaires distributed for the perception of the adequacy of aid funds show that some people 
think that they are not suitable for the assistance they receive. Thirty people answered incorrectly, and the remaining 
five responded accordingly. 
This shows that the perception of the adequacy of social assistance funds (Bansos) for the community and community 
groups in West Sulawesi Province has not met expectations. This is by Mrs. Andi Wahidah as treasurer of the Unsulbar 
expenditure of the Unsulbar financial section. 
""The disbursed aid funds are not by the funding needs because usually fewer funds are disbursed than the value of the 
proposal. (Interview with H Mrs. Andi Wahidah as treasurer of the Unsulbar expenditure of the Unsulbar financial 
section, 14 August 2020 at 10:05)."" 
From the narrative of Mrs. Andi Wahidah, it was found that the perception of the adequacy of social assistance funds 
(Bansos) was not by what was expected, where the community submitted a request for assistance to the provincial 
government, the value of the disbursed budget was not what was expected. However, some people are still grateful to 
receive help. This is by the opinion statement put forward by Mahmud, who is the imam of the Darul Huda Mosque. 
""Funds distributed to the community are sometimes appropriate, but sometimes there are some items of assistance that 
are not appropriate, but the community itself is still grateful. (Interview with Mahmud, who is the imam of the Darul 
Huda mosque, 16 August 2020, at 14:10) "". 
The West Sulawesi Provincial Government in distributing Social and Social Assistance and Grant funds have 
distributed religious, social assistance according to its portion, meaning that the provision of Social Assistance and 
Grant assistance is by the aid's standard West Sulawesi Provincial Government. So that there is an even distribution 
of the value of social assistance funds and grants provided by the West Sulawesi Provincial Government. 
Transparency is one of the strategies in optimizing the distribution of socio-religious assistance to West Sulawesi 
Province according to the mandate of Law No. 14 of 2008 concerning the Openness of Public Information. The 
Bandung City Government realizes that these grants and social assistance are the only public information that the 
public has the right to know. General Provisions Article 1 of Law no. 14 of 2008 explains that public input is generated, 
stored, managed, sent, and received by a public agency. It is related to the organizers and administration of the state 
and the administration and administration of other public bodies by this Law and additional information related to the 
public interest. The following is the information presented on the Sabilulungan website, namely about Sabilulungan, 
regulations, mechanisms, or SOPs for managing online grants and social assistance funds, data on proposers and 
recipients of pensions, and social assistance funds, community reports/complaints, and other information. 
According to the head of the Social Service of West Sulawesi Province, the delivery of grants and social assistance 
funds is not done directly or in cash to the recipients but is submitted via transfer to the recipient's account. This is an 
effort to avoid meeting the committee and recipients in offering grants and social assistance. In addition to facilitating 
the preparation of the grant and social assistance management reports, with evidence of transfers from the bank to the 
recipient, the words on the distribution of grants and social assistance are more accountable. 
5. Conclusion
In this study, several conclusions can be drawn. Namely, the results of the study show that for the timeliness of the 
distribution of social assistance/grants (Bansos) in the religious sector for the community and community groups in 
West Sulawesi province it has gone well on time. Likewise, the assistants who accompany the distributing social 
assistance/grants (Bansos) in the religious sector show that community groups in West Sulawesi province have been 
running well. However, there are some people and community groups who are not satisfied with the assistance. 
In addition, satisfaction with social assistance/grants (Bansos) in the religious sector for the community and 
community groups in West Sulawesi province has not been going well. This shows that the perception of the adequacy 
of social assistance funds/grants (Bansos) for the community and community groups submitting proposals, especially 
in the religious sector in West Sulawesi Province, has not matched expectations. 
Recipients of grants in the form of money/goods submit applications for grant disbursement to the Provincial 
Government of West Sulawesi with administrative requirements including a letter of application for issuance of

Grants to community organizations that are legal entities in Indonesia are given to community organizations whose 
associations have obtained legal entity approval from the ministry in charge of legal and human rights affairs by 
statutory regulations. The success of the grant and social assistance programs is also inseparable from available human 
resources. Humans are the most critical resource in determining the success of policy implementation. Each stage of 
performance requires quality human resources according to the professionalism implied by the policies established. 
The human resources who handle the grants and social assistance programs are sufficient in quantity, both from the 
related SKPD and the social welfare section and the DPPKAD.

Based on Table 3, the hypothesis testing in this study is described as follows: The beta coefficient of influence of 
transparency factor (X1) on effectiveness (Y1) of 0.238 is with a significance value of 0.004 or below 0.05. Beta 
coefficients also show that the transparency factor (X1) effect on effectiveness (Y1) is positive. This means that the 
transparency factor (X1) positively and significantly impacts effectiveness (Y1). Thus hypothesis 1, which affirms the 
transparency factor affects effectiveness in the Central Mamuju Regency Government, is accepted. 
The beta coefficient of the effect of accountability factor (X2) on effectiveness (Y1) of 0.549 is a significance value 
of 0.000 or below 0.05. Beta coefficients also showed the impact of the accountability factor (X2) on effectiveness 
(Y1) was positive. This means that the accountability factor (X2) positively and significantly affects effectiveness 
(Y1). Thus hypothesis 2, which states that accountability factors positively affect effectiveness in the Central Mamuju 
Regency Government, is accepted. 
The beta coefficient of influence of transparency factor (X1) on electronic procurement of goods and services (Y 2) 
amounted to 0.342 with a significance value of 0.000 or below 0.05. Beta coefficients also show that the influence of 
the transparency factor (X1) on the procurement of goods and services electronically (Y2) is positive. This means that 
the transparency factor (X1) has a positive and significant effect on the electronic procurement of goods and services 
(Y2). Thus, hypothesis 3 affirms the transparency factor affecting the procurement of goods and services electronically 
in the Central Mamuju Regency Government. 
The beta coefficient of accountability factor (X2) on electronic procurement of goods and services (Y 2) amounted to 
0.286 with a significance value of 0.001 or below 0.05. Beta coefficients also show the influence of accountability 
factors (X2) on the procurement of goods and services electronically (Y2) of positive value. This means that the 
accountability factor (X 2) has a positive and significant effect on the electronic procurement of goods and services 
(Y2). Thus hypothesis 4, which affirms the accountability factor affects the procurement of goods and services 
electronically in the Central Mamuju Regency Government, accepted. 
The beta coefficient of effectiveness (Y1) on the procurement (Y2) is amounted to 0.381 with a significance value of 
0.000 or below 0.05. Beta coefficients also show the effect of effectiveness (Y1) on the procurement of goods and 
services electronically (Y2) is positive. This means that the efficacy (Y1) positively affects the procurement of goods 
and services electronically (Y2). Thus hypothesis 5, which states the effectiveness of positively impacting the 
procurement of goods and services electronically in the Central Mamuju Regency Government, is accepted. 
If the t value of this calculation is compared to the t-table value, if the t value count is greater than the t-table value, 
then it can be concluded that there is an influence mediation . Based on the Sobel test, the calculated t value of the 
indirect effect accountability factor (X2) to the procurement of goods and services electronically (Y2) through 
effectiveness (Y1) is 5,603, and greater than t table = 1,660.  
The significant value of the indirect influence of accountability factor (X2) on the procurement of goods and services 
electronically (Y2) through effectiveness (Y1) is by the multiplication of the beta value of the coefficient of 
accountability factor (X2) on energy (Y1). It is 0.549 with the value of the beta coefficient of effectiveness (Y1) on 
the procurement of goods and services electronically (Y2), namely 0.381, plus / summed with the beta value of the 
coefficient of accountability factor (X2) to the procurement of goods and services electronically (Y2) namely 0.286, 
formulated mathematically, namely (0.549 X 0.381) + 0.286 = 0.495. Thus, the immense value of indirect 
accountability factor (X2) to the procurement of goods and services electronically (Y2) through effectiveness (Y1) is 
0.495. Thus, hypothesis 7 states that accountability factors positively affect the procurement of goods and services 
electronically through effectiveness in the Central Mamuju Regency Government. 
5. Conclusion
Based on the research results and discussion in the previous chapter related to the influence of transparency factors, 
accountability factors, and effectiveness on the procurement of goods and services electronically. It can be concluded 
that the transparency factor and accountability factors positively affect the procurement of goods and services 
electronically through effectiveness in the Central Mamuju Regency Government. Thus, to improve the transparency 
and accountability of electronic procurement of goods and services in the Central Mamuju Regency Government, 
transparency factors are needed. It can provide all provisions and information on the procurement of goods/services 
is clear and widely known by interested providers of goods/services and by the public in general. In addition to the

in the school. In this case, improved productivity and work performance can be done by enhancing human behaviour 
in the workplace by applying modern personnel management concepts and techniques. According to   Tamsah et al.

indicated by a coefficient value of 0.161 (positive); p-value or significance value less than 0.050 (0.000 < 0.050), 
which means that the mediation variable (quality of service) has a significant effect. So, it can be concluded that 
the role of bureaucracy has a positive and significant effect on the organization's performance mediated by the 
quality of service variables. 
 
This study also found that the coefficient of direct influence of bureaucratic role on organizational performance 
was 3.580. When involving the quality of service as an intervening variable in indirect effect, the magnitude of the 
influence of bureaucratic role on the organization's performance in Junior High School in Mamuju Sub-district of 
Mamuju Regency decreased. It is namely to 0.161 so that variable quality of service does not strengthen the 
influence of bureaucratic role on the organization's performance at SMPN in Mamuju Sub-district of Mamuju 
Regency.  
 
This study showed the role of bureaucracy has a more substantial influence on improving organizational 
performance than if mediated by the variable quality of service. The quality of service can be appropriately formed 
if employees and teachers can absorb and implement the appropriate or applicable organization work system. So 
by running a good bureaucracy, which is the structure of work arrangements, division of work, and hierarchy to 
carry out tasks to be more organized, can have a good influence on improving the organization's performance 
without the need to be mediated by the variable quality of service. 
 
5.7 Effect of Education Policy Implementation  
The seventh hypothesis test (H7) showed that the implementation of education policy affects the organization's 
performance mediated by the quality-of-service variables at SMPN in the Mamuju Sub-district of Mamuju 
Regency. It is shown with a coefficient value of 0.167; t-count 3,550 > t-table 1,658 also p-value or significance 
value of 0.000 which is smaller than 0.050. This means that the quality of service has a role by giving a significant 
positive influence in mediating the influence of the implementation of education policy on the performance of the 
organization in Mamuju Sub-district Junior High School of Mamuju Regency. 
 
This study found that the coefficient of direct influence between the implementation of education policy on 
organizational performance was 0.168. When involving the quality of service as an intervening variable in indirect 
effect, the influence of the implementation of education policy on the organization's performance at SMPN in 
Mamuju Sub-district of Mamuju Regency decreased. It is namely to 0.167 so that the existence of variable quality 
of service is not able to give a strong influence between the implementation of education policy and the 
performance of the organization at SMPN in Mamuju Sub-district Mamuju Regency. The results of this study prove 
and accept the seventh hypothesis (H7) that there is a positive and significant influence between the implementation 
of education policy on the performance of organizations mediated by the variable quality of service. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Based on the results of data testing and discussion, it resulted in a conclusion to answer the formulation of research 
problems in employees and teachers in Mamuju Sub-district Junior High School of Mamuju Regency that 
bureaucratic role carried out by employees and teachers in Junior High School in Mamuju Sub-district of Mamuju 
Regency is getting better, then the quality of services produced by employees and teachers will be better, if the 
implementation of education policy by employees and teachers in a school organization is getting better, then the 
quality of service will be better, if the role of bureaucracy in a school organization is good, then the performance 
of the organization in Junior High School in Mamuju Sub-district of Mamuju Regency will be increasing, if the 
implementation of education policy for employees and teachers in SMPN in Mamuju Sub-district of Mamuju 
Regency is getting better , then the performance of the organization will be improved, and if the quality of service 
of employees and teachers is getting better, then the performance of the organization will be better as well.

study results indicate that the work environment and compensation variables, directly and indirectly, influence job 
satisfaction and employee performance, so the existence of work environment and compensation variables need to be 
maintained, especially in increasing job satisfaction and employee performance. The work environment and 
compensation can be a reference for leaders at the Bantaeng Regency Regional Financial Management Agency in 
making organizational policies related to increasing job satisfaction and improving employee performance. The Office 
of the Regional Financial Management Agency of Bantaeng Regency should pay more attention to Job Satisfaction 
because from the descriptive results, it is the respondent's assessment with the lowest total mean value among other 
variables.

Abstract 
This study aimed to determine and analyze the influence of Human Resource (HR) competence and compensation on 
job satisfaction through excellent service at Lagaligo Hospital I, East Luwu Regency. This research was conducted at 
Lagaligo Hospital I, East Luwu Regency, using a causality design with a quantitative approach. The population of this 
study were all employees at Lagaligo Hospital I, East Luwu Regency, as many as 327 people. Sampling using simple 
random sampling technique, the final sample used was 120 people. Data were collected through observation, 
questionnaires, interviews, and documentation—data analysis using path analysis. The results showed that the 
provision of compensation is essential in increasing job satisfaction, which is indicated by the hospital management's 
ability to manage fair and proportional compensation. In addition, the competence of human resources is also an 
essential factor in increasing the level of employee satisfaction. Excellent service also influences job satisfaction where 
employees and health workers carry out their assigned tasks prioritize transparency and participation, meaning that 
the services they provide can provide satisfaction for themselves and patients as consumers. For an indirect effect, the 
competence of human resources can improve excellent service and then achieve job satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Currently, Indonesia is experiencing problems in almost all aspects of life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Many 
efforts have been made by the Indonesian government to contain the spread of Covid-19. According to WHO, 
vaccination is the safest, effective and simple way to protect yourself from dangerous diseases. Vaccines can train the 
body to make antibodies, by making the immune system stronger and building resistance to certain infections. 
Vaccines are harmless because they are made from weakened bacteria or viruses (WHO). Covid-19 vaccination data 
worldwide until August 13, 2021 is 1.82 M who have been fully vaccinated, and the dose given is 4.66 M 
(ourworldindata.org). Meanwhile, the achievement of Covid-19 vaccination in Indonesia is until August 12, 2021. 
People who have received the first vaccination are 51,894,566 and the second vaccine is 25,744,850 of the national 
vaccination target of 208,265,720 (covid19.go.id). Covid-19 vaccination in Central Java until August 6, 2021, for the 
first dose of vaccination as many as 5.4 million people, while for the second vaccine as many as 3 million people from 
the overall target of 28 million (jatengprov.go.id). Then the Covid-19 vaccination in Wonogiri Regency until August 
13, 2021 reached 109,408 people or 12.79% of the target target of 855,663 people (wonogirikab.go.id). Information 
about vaccines and Covid-19 can be accessed through the official website of the government and other institutions. 
Then in Tawangrejo village until September 6, 2021 the number of residents who have vaccinated as many as 435 
people, out of a total population of 4978 residents. 
At this time people get information instantly by using digital technology. Science and technology is developing very 
fast. So that during the Covid-19 pandemic, social media can be used as a media campaign about health. Digital 
campaigns are influenced by the characters who carry out the campaign. The content submitted needs to be supported 
by strong data. During a pandemic, digital campaigns that are packaged creatively can be a good step to increase 
public participation in preventive efforts in dealing with the Covid-19 virus (Naryoso et al 2021.)The content available

characters who carry out the campaign. The content submitted needs to be supported by strong data. During a 
pandemic, digital campaigns that are packaged creatively can be a good step to increase public participation in 
preventive efforts in dealing with the Covid-19 virus (Naryoso et al. 2019). The content available on Facebook is very 
informative because it explains various things about Covid-19. Starting from reviews of vaccines that are guaranteed 
safety before being circulated to the public. Explain about minor side effects after vaccination. The vaccine has also 
been tested by involving various groups so that it can be ensured that it is safe for everyone. The Covid-19 vaccine 
was developed to high safety standards. The Covid-19 virus cannot be transmitted through vaccines. This is in line 
with what the informant said that the information provided by Facebook about vaccination provided him with enough 
information to make him feel safe and confident to vaccinate. 
In this study as a validation of the authors using theory. This research will be studied with the dromology theory 
proposed by Paul Virilio. Dromology is a state where everything is measured through speed. Resulting in the 
disappearance of the boundaries of space and time (Ardiyansyah et al. 2019; Nath et al 2021.; Suharyanto et al. 2021). 
At this time people live instantly, and depend on technology. However, this situation makes humans do not care about 
their social environment. In line with what was conveyed by the informant that they do not need to leave the house to 
get information so that it causes them to interact less directly with their social environment. At this time people get 
information instantly by using digital technology. Science and technology is developing very fast. Science has an 
acceleration, at this time humans are equipped with technology. What makes the difference is the acceleration of 
technology, everything will be emphasized on time efficiency. At this time humans want an instant process, and that 
desire is supported by technology at this time. Social media Facebook provides instantaneous for the public to find 
information about Covid-19 and also vaccinations. Where when users type in their keywords they are immediately 
directed to a page that reviews vaccinations scientifically and has been verified 
Dromology causes people to experience a multitasking culture where they can carry out several activities at once. 
While they are looking for information about vaccines they can also do other work. The information provided is 
growing rapidly, and must be continuously updated so as not to miss out on information. At this time everything is 
digital, humans have to adapt to the situation, where they have to keep their distance from each other to stay safe. In 
the past, people who received information conventionally now have to adapt and utilize technology and social media 
as a means of education. They can get various information about vaccinations through social media, they no longer 
need to leave the house to buy newspapers, everything is in their hands. 
The information provided by Facebook plays an important role, digital education plays an important role in people's 
attitudes in deciding to use vaccination. The information they get quickly. Give them an overview of many things 
about vaccination. It was explained that the vaskin was safe and had gone through a lab test so that people were 
convinced to vaccinate. This proves that society has adapted to the accelerating culture. They have accepted social 
media as one of the media that can be used as an educational medium, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
7. Conclusion
During the Covid-19 pandemic, people use social media more often than before. This is due to several factors, ranging 
from maintaining a safe distance, the interests of fulfilling interactions with other people, to the interests of education. 
Technology is developing rapidly, information is spread without knowing space and time. Along with the times, people 
began to accept social media as a means of education. This is also because at this time people like things that are 
instant and efficient. Digital education on vaccinations in overcoming the spread of COVID-19 in the Tawangrejo 
Village community with Facebook social media. Education can be done by accessing a page that provides information 
about Covid-19. The information provided is valid and can be justified. The public responds wisely to the information 
about vaccinations they get on Facebook social media. They are not afraid to take vaccinations because from the 
information they get, the vaccine is safe to use by various groups because it has gone through testing.

Abstract 
Transnationalism refers to the spread of economic, political, and cultural processes beyond national borders. Sebatik 
Island is unique because the northern region of the island is owned by Malaysia and the southern region belongs to 
Indonesia. No fence or wall was built to separate the two communities, and there is an informal cross border movement 
between Malaysia and Indonesia communities. The existence of cross-border trade between two neighboring countries 
reflects economic ties between border communities. The objectives of this study are 1) to measure the degree of 
socioeconomic ties between communities across borders between Sebatik Malaysia-Indonesia; 2) to assess the 
feasibility of creating Sebatik Border Trade Center for regional economic integration. This study employed an in-
depth interview with the stakeholders involved in the governance of development in the study area. The selection of 
stakeholders was based on purposive sampling. Secondary data relating to economic activities was also used to 
strengthen the findings of the in-depth interview. Fieldwork to Sebatik Island was also carried out for observation of 
the current economic scenario. The economic fundamentals of Sebatik Island Malaysia-Indonesia were examined with 
the feasibility of regional economic integration by establishing a Border Trade Center in the Island. Thus, transborder 
economic development can be planned systematically by both the government of Malaysia and Indonesia as a strategic 
approach to strengthen the Sebatik economy. The development rubrics of the Sebatik Border Trade Center will take 
into account economic considerations, while maintaining security approaches to enhance economic development in 
the border areas.

1. Introduction
Indonesia and Malaysia are two countries that share both maritime border on the west side between the Malay 
Peninsula and Sumatra Island and land border on the east side between Sarawak-Sabah and the Indonesian provinces 
of Borneo. This land border stretches for 2,004 km from Tanjung Datu in the west to Sebatik Island in the east. As a 
land border, Sebatik Island, which located near eastern Sabah and North Kalimantan, covers 452 km2 of land and is 
considered unique because it falls under two different governments, with the northern region governed by Malaysia 
and the south is administered by Indonesia (see Figure 1). There is no fence or wall other than a small rock and a 
mango tree that serve as markings for the separation of Sebatik’s Malaysia and Indonesia. Although formally separated 
and jointly recognized in terms of border politics, there is still informal cross-border mobility between individuals for 
economic and social purposes. This is due to the fact that the communities on Sebatik Island have had strong social 
and economic ties since even before the pre-colonial era, as the two communities are ethnically, culturally, 
linguistically, and religiously similar; Malays and Muslims.  
However, it is the modern world bureaucracy that creates political boundary and requires passport travel documents 
transboundary movements through immigration and customs inspection at entry/exit gates in Tawau or Nunukan. 
However, family ties between border communities continue to take place informally between families on Sebatik

6. Conclusion  
Transnationalism on Sebatik Island is attributed to formal and informal cross-border activities and practices, as well 
as the intensity of cross-border exchanges. Ethnic and religious bonds also strengthen cross-border activities.  Trade 
ties also indirectly promote bonds of togetherness between communities on Sebatik Island. In assessing the feasibility 
of creating Sebatik Border Trade Center, this paper proposes two alternatives: Sebatik Barter Trade Center and Sebatik 
Special Border Economic Zone. A one-stop inspection system must be designed for the Sebatik Barter Trade Center 
in Wallace Bay to increase the efficiency of the barter trade system and achieve seamless supply chain connectivity 
between Nunukan and Tawau. Since Sebatik Barter Trade Center is located on Malaysian territory, it also requires the 
cooperation of the Indonesian government and barter trades to comply with the Malaysian government's rules and 
regulations. As the volume of barter trade between Nunukan and Tawau intensifies, the Sebatik Barter Trade Center 
is expected to provide locals with economic and employment opportunities. 
 
A unified set of policies and incentives in finance, taxation, investment, trade, and customs regulations need to be 
enacted for SBEZ. This means that close institutional collaboration between the Malaysian and Indonesian 
governments, especially at the Malaysia-Indonesia Socio-Economic Cooperation Committee (Sosek Malindo) level, 
is crucial for the establishment of the SBEZ on Sebatik Island. In order for SBEZ to succeed, both governments must 
develop soft and hard infrastructure components in the SBEZ. The hard and soft infrastructure components will 
strengthen transboundary economic activities and further facilitate the development of Sebatik Island. The current 
issues, such as the suspension of Indonesian PLB for cross-border mobility and Indonesian vessels' compliance with 
international maritime safety standards imposed by the Malaysian government, as well as outstanding border problems 
between the two countries, must all be addressed for the Sebatik Barter Trade Centre or SBEZ to succeed.

Abstract 
This study uses a qualitative descriptive method on five different groups in Banjar City who use E-Warong KUBE as 
a source of their daily income. This research was conducted in October 2019 before COVID-19 became a global 
pandemic. We use the concept of gotong royong proposed by John R Bowen to see the participation of women in 
maintaining household needs through E-Warong KUBE PKH. We addressed two questions: In which ways are women 
managing E-Warong KUBE PKH as a jointly managed retailed business? and how they can meet their household 
needs through this activity? So far, gotong royong is seen as an ideology that is politically reflected in social life. 
Relying on our observations and interviews on our information network, we found a new face of gotong royong and 
its attachment to women’s activities in maintaining household needs, especially family food security. Our 
recommendations are addressed to relevant stakeholders to be able to accommodate, provide skills training, and bridge 
the group with relevant CSR programs in each region as an effort to establish a sustainable business solution for actors 
of E-Warong KUBE PKH, especially in the age of COVID-19

1. Introduction
Efforts to eradicate hunger and gender inequality are two important goals that are included in the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) (UN, 2015). E-WARONG KUBE PKH (Electronic-Shop with Mutual assistance Joint 
Business Group For the Family Hope Program) is one of the Government’s programs through the Ministry of Social 
Affairs launched by the President in 2016. The background of the establishment of this program is to realize digital-
based inclusive national finances (Semeru; KOMPAK; 2017). E-Warong aims to accommodate digital-based inclusive 
national finance by integrating all non-cash assistance or subsidy distributions and empowering human resources who 
are members of the Family Hope Program (PKH).  
Apart from being a provider of non-cash assistance distribution services, E-WARONG also serves public goods for 
the wider community. The existence of E-Warong has a duality in carrying out its activities. On the one hand, E-
Warong is required to provide affordable basic needs for poor family. On the other hand, E-WARONG is also hit by 
stiff competition with modern minimarkets (Solekhah). Why does E-WARONG still exist amid many new modern 
markets selling more products? Because E-Warong applies a work management system in mutual assistance by 
involving women with a mutually agreed division of labor. The position of women as treasurers of the family makes 
them have to be more innovative. As feminist experts say, the role of women as treasurers of the family can mean the 
loss of women’s autonomy, if that role makes them responsible for providing inadequate funds (Li, 2020). Therefore, 
these family treasurers must arrange strategies to meet their household needs. One of their ways to care for their 
families is by joining E-Warong Program. E-WARONG can survive through financial management with a profit 
allocation system as follows: 60% for capital development, 30% distributed to administrators or caretakers, and 10% 
for social funds.

and labor which they can still allocate to informal side jobs such as manual labor, for example as a laundress, stone 
crusher, and so on. This type of work indicates that female E-Warong actors in Banjar have a double burden to fulfill 
their household needs. Most of them have more than one job as their livelihood strategy. This means that E-Warong 
is not the only one they rely on.  
 
However, the spirit of these women is constrained by the limitation of their mastery of technology and communication. 
so that their action only revolves around selling products offered will be marketed to families with low incomes too. 
So this becomes an infinite obstacle as long as the welfare of households has not increased yet. If they only rely on 
income from keeping the E-Warong retailed shop in shift alternately, their welfare cannot be said to have increased 
significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to do business development scheme solutions from these existing groups. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Even though it has been running since 2016, the E-Warong KUBE PKH is still existing. The idea for its establishment 
started with the integration of digital-based inclusive finance so that the distribution of assistance could be done in a 
non-cash manner. However, in its implementation, women organize themselves through the gotong-royong 
mechanism to maintain the E-Warong KUBE PKH with various kinds of innovations. They learn to convert their spare 
time into another form of capital, maintaining social relations through social funds. These women also widen their 
social network through E-Warong KUBE PKH. Money in their minds is not only about nominal, but from the value 
attached relationally to other aspects. Therefore, the bond between members and administrators of E-Warong can be 
maintained. With a relatively low non-fixed income, these women can still provide for their household needs by 
working as temporary workers. Social funds that bind the administrators can also run according to their functions. 
This indicates that there is mutual trust. Trust is one of the strong assets that can be used as an embryo for 
empowerment. Therefore, the recommendations from this study are addressed to relevant stakeholders to be able to 
accommodate, provide skills training, and bridge the group with relevant CSR programs in each region. Thus, 
empowerment is a form of development that can be carried out by cross-actor, it can be Government or companies, or 
both of them. So that the meaning of mutual assistance (gotong royong) does not only become village-centric but also 
penetrates the development of the urban context.

Abstract 
The Pandemic of Covid-19 affects several sectors, mainly tourism. The tourism entrepreneur should innovate and 
adjust to the current situation. It is necessary to maintain the sustainability of his enterprise. However, the number of 
visitors declined dramatically, but the tourism products can be sold online. Lasem, situated in Rembang Regency in 
Central Java, has some cultural tourism potential, especially the local creation of Batik Tiga Negeri (three Countries 
Batik). This study aims to describe the virtual tour of Batik Tiga Negeri, initiated by a Lasem heritage foundation 
collaborate with tourist agency, and the effect of its innovation in maintaining the sustainability of cultural tourism in 
Lasem. Three categories of social resilience based on Keck and Sakdapolrak’s theory were used to analize this result. 
This study found that (1) the virtual tour of Batik Tiga Negeri narrates the story of its batik and the process of colouring 
Lasem Batik in three areas so that it might attract the virtual tourists to donate as they wish; and (2) the contribution 
of tourists could help the sustainability of the batik maker in Lasem. The batik makers faced a declined income during 
the pandemic. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
The outbreak of Covid-19 has mainly decreased the economic sector mainly in tourism between 2020 and 2021. Most 
of countries close the foreigner visit and forbid its inhabitants to go to overseas. This similar policy is also taken by 
Indonesia, where the foreign tourist visit is limited or forbidden. This affects to the decline of International and 
domestic visitors (Afriana and Widiyanto 2021). The mobility of domestic tourist is limited and even static because 
of the locked-down policy in many provinces and cities, in the form of PSBB (Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar or 
Large Scale Social Restriction) and PPKM Mikro (Pemberlakuan Pembatasan Kegiatan Masyarakat or Public 
Activity Restriction Implementation). These data show the significant decline on the foreign tourist visit to Indonesia 
in 2020 and 2021 based on Central Bureau of Statistics, as in:

The virtual tour of Lasem batik during the pandemic gives remarkable experience and income for the tourism actors 
in Lasem. This activity trains tourism actors, especially Lasem Heritage Foundation to learn how to cope crisis 
condition which becomes barrier to develop tourism globally. This lesson learned gives experience for them, that if 
the same and unpredictable condition happens in the future, Lasem Heritage Foundation have the capability to organize 
the virtual tour with other destination in Lasem. It is also discussed by one of Lasem Heritage Foundation members: 
“….virtual tour of Batik Tiga Negeri makes us learn to survive during the pandemic. In the future, we have many 
vision and plan to organize other virtual tour with different destination. However, there is an obstacle, like other 
destinations are still needed to be studied therefpre we could use it as an interesting story telling in the virtual tour…” 
(Interview with YA 28 November 2021).  
In other side, the tourism actors also have a profit from virtual tour. The virtual tour of Batik Tiga Negeri provides 
several advantages for tourism actors in Lasem and Lasem batik, namely by selling virtual tour tickets, tourism actors 
in Lasem have income during the pandemic, besides that part of the income is given to house of Batik Lasem. The 
sale of batik increasing in the end of virtual tour also helps the batik makers to survive and work in the batik house. 
Most tourists are interested in buying mahakan products, batik products and their derivatives, and handicrafts through 
virtual markets. Batik products that are adapted to the needs of the pandemic, such as Batik Tiga Negeri masks attract 
tourists to buy them. The demand for batik products automatically maintains the livelihoods of the batik artisans who 
work in the batik house in Lasem. 
6. Conclusion
The Covid-19 pandemic has paralyzed the world's tourism sector, including in Indonesia. Lasem District, Rembang 
Regency, Central Java Province, Indonesia which is recently promoted as historical and cultural tourism was affected 
by the pandemic. The absence of tourist visits in Lasem, result in the decrease of the batik sale so that the welfare of 
Lasem batik is threatened. The stakeholders tourism in Lasem who are members of the Lasem Heritage Foundation 
and Kesengsem Lasem have local belongingness to their area. This is a spirit for tourism actors in Lasem to cope this 
problem. They utilize the resources in Lasem as a commodity in maintaining sustainable tourism. This effort is the 
coping capacity of tourism actors in Lasem. The tourist attractions and history are used as the resources to attarct the 
visitors. Adaptive capacity of tourism actors is the idea of a virtual tour of Batik Tiga Negeri. They choose one of the 
cultural tours where the perpetrators are mostly affected by the pandemic (old Lasem batik makers with daily wages). 
The virtual tour combines between technological innovation and Lasem tourism actors, as a result of collaboration 
with travel agents, namely traval.co. The virtual tour activity tells the history of the three basic colors of Lasem batik 
and the ancient batik house which is still operating. In the virtual tour, the tour guide offers tourists Lasem MSME 
products in its virtual market, namely the Lasem People's Market. The transformative capacity in this innovation is 
that tourism actors have the courage to network with various parties, such as: (1) travel agents; (2) government 
institutions; (3) private institutions in the implementation of virtual tours. The Batik Tiga Negeri virtual tour 
contributes to the sustainability of tourism actors in Lasem, especially the Lasem Heritage Foundation and the Lasem 
batik artisans.

Abstract 
This article examines strategies to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic using a community development approach, 
namely Pemberlakuan Pembatasan Kegiatan Masyarakat (PPKM) mikro or Community Activity Restrictions at the 
micro level. This study was conducted in Malang City, East Java Province, Indonesia. This study found that this 
strategy has distributed greater authority to community members to participate in preparedness and response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. There are two mechanisms that have been established to implement PPKM, which are the 
zoning system and the establishment of COVID-19 headquarters at the RT/RW level. This study found that PPKM 
has succeeded in reducing positive cases and preventing transmission of the coronavirus. The strategy of PPKM has 
replaced the prior strategy, which employed a top-down approach and relied on dominant agent roles, such as 
government, medical experts, politicians, public health officials, and economists. This strategy could be problematic 
because, in some cases, it has provided an ideal setting for authoritarian practices.

1. Introduction
From the beginning of 2020 until now, the COVID-19 pandemic has still brought distress and anxiety to people’s lives 
around the world. The coronavirus disease has risked public health and disrupted normal social life. Therefore, an 
appropriate and effective strategy is required to respond to this pandemic. In the beginning, a top-down approach or 
macro strategies have been conducted by central stakeholders including governments, medical experts, politicians, 
public health officials, and economists to construct policies and implement them without involving citizens or 
community participation (Kenny, 2020,  Schutte 2020, Westoby and Harris 2020; Leach 2021 ). Included in these 
policies are lockdown, social isolation, social distancing, and other health protocol policies that restrict social 
interactions and movement of community members to prevent and control coronavirus transmissions. 
The communities or citizens were required to comply with health protocol policies and put their trust in the central 
stakeholders. This regulation in some countries has provided an ideal setting for authoritarian practices (Kenny, 
“Covid-19 and Community Development”). This authoritarian practice has been demonstrated in several ways or 
strategies. First, under the pretext of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has diminished 
transparency based on important advice from health scientists (Kenny, “Covid-19 and Community Development”). 
Second, the government has expanded surveillance of citizens by launching numerous tracing mechanisms, including 
applications, in order to collect and store data from them (Westoby and Harris 2020). Under the fear and panic 
situation, as well as to ensure their safety, it is easier for citizens to ""surrender"" to the government regulations by 
downloading those applications. Third, the government has harnessed military power (Kenny, 2020). Kenny further 
explained that the most effective way to ensure the compliance of a community is by employing the fourth strategy, 
by which the state or government has constructed the role of self-righteous monitoring on individuals and self-
surveillance agents at the community level, resulting in the involvement of communities as part of a repressive state. 
For instance, ""authoritarian populists such as Orban in Hungary and Bolsonaro in Brazil have used the pandemic as a 
cover to extend their powers, by eliminating dissent and extending state surveillance"" (Kenny, 2020).

Table 2 illustrates the zoning system that has been conducted in PPKM micro. The different colors of flags have been 
utilized to indicate the numbers of households that are confirmed positive for COVID-19 at the RT level. Moreover, 
this zoning system can be used for two purposes, which are internal and external. First, for external purposes, this 
system will alert other people when they want to go to a RT or an area in Malang regarding the number of people who 
are confirmed positive for COVID-19. Based on this information, these people could decide whether they will or will 
not go to a RT or an area. Second, for internal purposes, this system informs community members as to the kind of 
response they should undertake to respond to the impact of pandemic COVID-19. 
4.2 The Establishment of Pos Komando (Posko) or Covid-19 Headquarter at RT Level 
Another mechanism that has been conducted in PPKM micro is the establishment of COVID-19 headquarters at the 
RT level to respond to COVID-19. Through this mechanism, the Indonesian government has also given greater 
authority to the community members regarding preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic. An informant 
explained that RT’s headquarters had some responsibilities to respond to COVID-19. The first responsibility is that 
this headquarters has to identify community members who are confirmed positive for COVID-19. Second, this 
identification will be communicated to higher COVID-19 headquarters, including RW, Village, and PUSKESMAS. 
Responsibilities are related to social and economic aspects. Community members have a responsibility to support their 
neighbors who are confirmed positive for COVID-19 to fulfill their food needs and all facilities needed during self-
isolation. Third, COVID-19 headquarters at the RT level has the responsibility to support its members to overcome 
the psychological issues they face. For instance, by providing motivation to members who are confirmed positive for 
COVID-19 as well as ensuring that there is no stigma and exclusion from other members, Moreover, COVID-19 
headquarters at the RT level also has the responsibility to increase public knowledge related to the COVID-19 
pandemic by delivering information about this pandemic's health protocols (wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding 
crowds), vaccinations, tracing, and so on. The headquarters could also establish regulations at the RT level to give 
rewards and punishment to community members for compliance with health protocols.  
From the explanation above, this study found that PPKM micro has been conducted based on a community 
development approach. This approach has distributed greater authority to the community members to undertake 
preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic based on their own ideas and creativity. This strategy would 
be effective to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic because the community members are in the best position to have 
the appropriate knowledge, cultural, and social understanding as well as what their needs are in responding to COVID-
19. This study shows that PPKM micro strategy has put community members as the subject instead of objects in
preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the involvement of community participation will
ensure the sustainability of this strategy. It can be shown that by employing the PPKM micro strategy, the Indonesian
government has succeeded in preventing the transmission of coronavirus and addressed various issues caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. It is evident from the fact that Indonesia has the best COVID-19 Recovery Index in ASEAN
(Setkab).
5. Conclusion
This study shows that a community development approach is required to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 
pandemic. This approach has been adopted to the Indonesian partial lockdown, namely the Pemberlakuan Pembatasan 
Kegiatan Masyarakat (PPKM) mikro or Community Activities Restriction at the micro level. This strategy has 
involved many community members from the lowest level of government in Indonesia, which is RT/RW. This strategy 
also gives greater authority to the members to undertake some mechanisms or strategies, including the establishment 
of a zoning system and COVID-19 headquarters. In Malang, East Java Province, there is a unique strategy for 
conducting the zoning system. This strategy has utilized different colors of flags to inform people regarding the 
number of people who are confirmed positive for COVID-19 in each RT. From the lowest until the highest level of 
case, each flag informs the stage of positive cases, from the green flag for the first stage (zero cases), yellow for the 
second stage (1–5 cases), orange for the third stage (6–10 cases) and red for the fourth stage (more than 10 cases). 
Another strategy is to establish Covid-19 headquarters in each RT. This headquarters is required to undertake several 
responsibilities, which include not only responding to the positive case of COVID-19 and its impact, but also 
conducting preparedness to prevent the transmission of coronavirus. This study demonstrates that PPKM micro, which 
adopts a community development approach, has become an effective way to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
From the evidence, it can be shown that Indonesia has the best COVID-19 Recovery Index in ASEAN.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 pandemic has not only shifted religious patterns but has also raised sentiments against certain groups 
in society. The cases that occurred was the Covid-19 cluster case from the Tablighi Jamaat after holding the Ijtima 
'Ulama throughout Asia in Gowa, South Sulawesi. Participants who took part in these religious activities came from 
various regions, including Wonosobo Regency. Holding religious events by inviting large crowds during a pandemic 
is considered inappropriate. So, the activity became a new cluster for the spread of COVID-19 determined by the 
government. This study examines changes in the socio-religious life of the Tablighi Jamaat and community sentiment 
towards religious sects during the Covid-19 period in Wonosobo Regency, Central Java. This study uses qualitative 
research with interviews as a data collection technique. This study uses the dimensions of religious commitment from 
Charles Y Glock and Rodney Stark. This study found that the socio-religious life of the Tablighi Jamaat experienced 
a shift due to increasing public sentiment towards religious groups. Changes in group religious rituals adapt to social 
conditions even though they are contrary to religious beliefs and obedience. So that new ritual practices are carried 
out to survive the larger sentiment.

1. Introduction
Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a significant impact on the social and economic life of the community 
(Stojkoski et al. 2020). Not only in the economic field, but the impact generated by COVID-19 also affects people's 
religious patterns. It can be seen from efforts to minimize worship activities that involve many people, including Hajj 
and Umrah (Yezli and Khan 2020). The impact of COVID-19 not only affects worship activities but also increases 
religious sentiment in society. In Nuurrianti Jalli's research, religious sentiments related to COVID-19 have emerged 
in Indonesia and Malaysia. Jalli provides accurate data through public responses on social media that have justified 
the Tablighi Jamaat as one of the spreads of the virus (Purnomo 1996) responsible for the spread of COVID-19 in 
Malaysia and Indonesia (Idris and Jalli 2020). 
In Dan Ariely's view, the emergence of religious sentiments during a pandemic is a natural thing. According to him, 
this is due to the natural state of humans who unconsciously respond to dangerous situations that threaten themselves 
in crises (Ariely).The threat of being infected with SARS-Cov-2, which is the cause of COVID-19, can give rise to 
new models of racism and xenophobia in religious communities in Indonesia. This new racism and xenophobia are 
associated with specific religious sects (Abadi and Muthohirin 2020; Nath et al. 2021; Suharyanto et al. 2021). This 
kind of attitude is shown by the people of Kejajar District, Wonosobo Regency, Central Java, towards the Tablighi 
Jamaat community. 
Facing resistance and negative public sentiment towards members of the Tablighi Jamaat does not alienate them. It 
strengthens family ties and improves their worship practices. The increase in religiosity experienced by this 
community is part of the influence of religious beliefs on the actions of its adherents. This factor makes a minority 
community more obedient than a larger community, thus causing minority groups to show their existence increasingly 
(Sinding 2019).

The words of the Syuro (Principals of the Tablighi Jamaat), worship becomes a medicine or a solution that can be 
done. By following the directions of the great leaders of the Tablighi Jamaat to increase charity according to the 
solutions carried out by the Tablighi Jamaat. Amid these uncertain conditions, the Tablighi Jamaat chose a safe 
response by staying silent and reducing movement. It is to maintain conduciveness in the community, not to cause 
tremendous opposition to the Tablighi Jamaat community. It is undeniable that public resistance to the Tablighi Jamaat 
does exist. As stated by one of the pilgrims below: Until I was not allowed to enter the mosque, I moved to another 
mosque for up to 2 months because my prayer rug was sprayed with disinfectant (This means rejection). Why only 
my prayer mat? After two months, I met the imam (Chairman of the Mushola). Pak Imam, I have two months. I want 
to ask for time to meet with residents to say something. It is strange how come it is like this. (Interview with Abdur 
Rosyid. Tablighi Jamaat). 
Another adaptation of this phenomenon is to change places of worship. The solid intention for worship does not fade 
even though the surrounding community is shunned. However, finding other places of worship that allow Tablighi 
Jamaat to worship freely is not easy. Especially with the label pinned by residents as a covid-19 cluster. However, this 
is a response to the community that confronted the existence of the Tablighi Jamaat. The temporary relocation of 
places of worship is also a form of ritual to get closer to Allah by carrying out the practices taught in the Tablighi 
Jamaat group. It is recommended that women pray at home while men in the prayer room or the mosque (Interview 
with Abdur Rosyid. Tablighi Jamaat). It is what underlies the Tablighi Jamaat to continue to carry out worship 
according to the guidance they believe. So the response to changing places of worship is a better solution than praying 
at home. It is inseparable from the values always accepted during the study that men are strongly encouraged to pray 
in the prayer room or mosque. It was done even though other worshipers opposed the old place of worship. 
5.3. Proposed Improvements 
This study of the Tablighi Jamaat is a discourse in the sociology of religion and socio-religious movements which is 
quite interesting to study. Many religious phenomena occur that lead to fanaticism and radicalism, so this study of the 
Tablighi Jamaat is an interesting example of how a community group adapts from the alignment of other majority 
groups which are expected to be studied so as not to create a religious extremist group. 
6. Conclusion
The impact of holding the Ijma Ulama during the pandemic has brought the Tablighi Jamaat into a religious 
organization that many people talk about. During the pandemic, it is not allowed to hold events that invite many 
people. However, the Tablighi Jamaat carried out Ijma' Ulama activities, which followers of Tablighi Jamaat attended 
throughout Indonesia and from various countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Thailand. Even 
though the reason for the event has been prepared, the community cannot tolerate it. Thus, the Tabligh congregation 
who returned from Goa, South Sulawesi, as the location for the Ijma 'Ulama event was considered a cluster of covid, 
which was considered disturbing by the general public. It resulted in sentiment by the community towards the Tablighi 
Jamaat group. The increasing public sentiment towards the Tablighi Jamaat group during the Covid-19 pandemic 
requires adaptation in the Tablighi Jamaat group. These adaptations include the dimensions of religious rituals (Macro) 
and the dimensions of ritual obedience (Micro). These two dimensions can be explained as follows: 
Some Tablighi Jamaat followers were labeled as a cluster of the Covid-19 spread when they returned to their place of 
origin. Neighbors and the surrounding community began to stay away because of the COVID-19 cluster label carried 
by people who had just returned from Goa, South Sulawesi, where the Ijma' Ulama was held. It does the practice of 
worshiping the Tablighi Jamaat to be opposed by the community. It is feared that Tablighi Jemaah will transmit the 
virus to the community. So that, some community resistance was carried out, such as spraying the prayer mat of one 
of the Tablighi Jamaat, avoiding, alienating, and stigmatizing the Tablighi Jamaat and their families. 
The form of adaptation carried out is by reducing communal activities among the Tablighi Jamaat, such as 
congregational prayers, Jaulah, Khuruj, and other religious activities. It is to keep away from the potential for more 
significant community resistance. Through the common fate of being shunned by the community, the Tablighi Jamaat 
group becomes more solid. Support each other, such as donating to the Tablighi Jamaat family, who is currently in 
isolation in the hospital, comforting and strengthening each other, and praying for each other. Tablighi Jamaat's 
internal relations are getting closer because they feel they are experiencing the same problem. 
Tablighi Jamaat, who has positive signs of Covid-19, should be isolated in the hospital. While in the hospital, religious 
practices such as Ta'lim, Reciting Al-Quran, and other forms of religious practice increased compared to worship in

the days before isolation. It is the same with family at home. By getting alined from the community, the thing to do is 
surrender to God and continue to pray for protection and help from God. In addition, due to the limitation of movement 
in public spaces, it is possible to do more praying to Allah and perform religious rituals more intensely. When society 
shuns him and his family, it creates a deep sense of despair. The Tablighi Jamaat family increasingly believes in the 
power of God. It is where obedience increases.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has demanded many adaptations in all life aspects, including the governance performed by 
governmental organizations. In consort with Indonesia's social restrictions policy which is carried out widely in 
continual periods, impacts on the performance shown by the local governments are quite blatant, which appears to 
hinder the success of duties they are responsible for. Basically, the current study seeks to describe the provincial 
governance resilience in East Java in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. Through agile governance perspective, the 
research is aimed to discover information related to what extent East Java Province governments have been 
demonstrating agile governance with due regards to the six key principles implemented during the pandemic. 
Moreover, a qualitative research method, by means of descriptive explanation design, was applied. Research data, in 
addition, were collected through document searching and in-depth interview with some related agencies. Concerned 
on four governance dimensions, i.e., the government, bureaucracy, civil society, and economic community, the 
research had shown that despite their efforts to perform the agility, the East Java Province governments could not fully 
and properly meet the whole principles of agile governance yet. It means that with all the improvements or 
accelerations made for the sake of work under the state of agile governance, a number of aspects were left weakened, 
and needed enhancements still.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia, since March 2020, has caused instable situations throughout the state so as to 
change the whole structure of life aspects, so rapidly. Consequently, such a situation has swiftly turned into crises: not 
only health, but also multidimensional crises, i.e., science, economy, socio-culture, and psychology. The crises, 
moreover, appear to disrupt the principles of essential sectors in the human’s life. Like it or lump it, the crises also 
demand fast and adaptive responses from the humans, exclusively related to governance system.  
Theoretically and practically speaking, a bureaucracy has no tendencies to innovate. Pierson (2000) argues that in a 
bureaucracy, public and formal institutional policies are designed not adhering to innovations; instead, their practices 
are often based on specific decisions made in the past. Stated by Jansen &  Vort (2016), one of typical characteristics 
of a bureaucracy is the limit of reactions and adaptiveness to reform. The reason why a bureaucracy is typified that 
way is due to its basis pertinent to traditional governance, with stability and accountability as cores of work orientation 
based on regulations made in response to long-termed necessities. Furthermore, the characteristic of a bureaucracy 
reflecting the governance is, therefore, faced to dynamic situations of life; one of which is the current pandemic one. 
In this situation, feelings of uncertainty, anxiety due to social threats, and enormous loss potentials undergone by the 
State or regions are rising. At this moment, indeed will the governments have no other choices to take, except agile 
resilience to respond to any possibilities caused by the current crisis. 
Agile governance is basically centered to the contribution of the governments or institutions to giving fast responses 
to any unexpected changes in order to fulfil public needs and demands that also reform due to the changes (Ngai. et.al, 
2011). Specifically, agile government is defined as a specific ability possessed by organizations to perform financial 
duties efficiently, along with it, to accelerate and maintain accuracy in the exploitation of probabilities to be converted

continuity for improvement. It was due to the fact that innovations for infrastructure of programs and policies had 
existed, but the operation was still problematic. As one of examples, the program Jatim Social Care, to date, are still 
remaining problematic in the real-life practice.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the foregoing analysis on agile governance approach applied in the observation, this research concludes that 
the governance of East Java Province, in the time of pandemic, has been basically implementing agile governance. It 
is evidenced by a number of innovations which can be referred to as a reflection for working under agile principles, 
covering: good enough governance, business-driven, human-focused, based on quick wins, and systematic and 
adaptive approach. Meanwhile, those six principles are embodied in various policies or priority decisions, exclusively 
in dealing with the new normal situations based on the varied dimensions.  
 
This excellence must be acknowledged that it is closely linked to the willingness shown by related governmental 
agencies to make innovations based on primary aspects of technology. For example, in civil community, the East Java 
Province Government, through a PMD Service, has made use of varied technological aids to carry out several agendas 
for village communities. By such a pattern, the government can warrant that numerous priority programs intended for 
rural communities are still running despite face-to-face limits.  
 
However, though some dimensions of agile governance principles generate successes, especially in the new normal, 
not all of these principles can be actualized, nonetheless. These limits obviously occur, therefore. For instance, data 
problems are becoming a serious challenge, to date, for the Social Services Office. The identification is based on the 
low-quality state of Systematic and Adaptive Approach, especially in case of data integration between the provincial 
and municipal/regional governments. It, therefore, results in cases of inaccurate distribution of social assistances for 
communities.  
 
Furthermore, the governance applied in East Java, primarily during the new normal era, can be considered improved 
or either accelerated in terms of running agile government. Despite such a fact, there are still some dimensions 
remaining for further enhancements.

Abstract 
National development often causes various kinds of problems. The problems happen because the policies about 
national development made by the Indonesian government tend to take sides with businesspeople and impact on the 
oppression of the society. National development argued for the society’s welfare eventually turns out to be detrimental 
for the society and threatens the survival of the society. Moreover, it tends to destroy the natural environment where 
the society depends its life. Currently, there are many natural resources that should be used as much as possible for 
the society’s welfare. However, many of those natural resources are controlled by businesspeople that are regulated 
in the free market and camouflaged in democratization existence. The Indonesian government, which is supposed to 
have a significant role in protecting the society, evidently takes sides with businesspeople in the interest of seeking 
financial benefits without paying attention to various aspects of the society’s life. This condition has brought several 
kinds of the society’s social movements as the response to neoliberalist policies that basically eliminate the concept 
of the society’s sovereignty. The social movement conducted by the society of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta, 
as a discussion focus of this paper, is a form of the society’s response to the government’s policies related to national 
development in the iron sand mining construction project that tends to take sides with businesspeople and harms the 
society in many aspects.

1. Introduction
The society’s welfare is a keyword often conveyed by the Indonesian government as a goal of “the national 
development concept” that still becomes the main priority of the Indonesian government up to this day (Sufyan 2015). 
Indonesia, which is included in the category of developing countries, continuously strives to make improvements 
through actions (work programs) called “the national development concept”. National development conducted by the 
Indonesian government is intended to lead Indonesia to be a powerful developed country equal to other countries that 
have been included in the category of developed countries. With this goal, it is not surprising that national development

of Yogyakarta began to be careful in accepting various information provided by external parties. The people of the 
southern coastal area of Yogyakarta also began to sort out the various external organizations and institutions that were 
present in their midst to help them. From this occurrence, the most important thing is that the society of the southern 
coastal area of Yogyakarta started to realize the threat toward its unity, thus the local society then had a stronger 
commitment to remain united so that they were not easily pitted against each other. However, as a result of the pitting 
done by the government, the people of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta have been divided into two opposing 
parts, some remained firmly against the iron sand mining construction project and some turned to take sides with the 
government-businesspeople. 
 
In addition to using ways that are considered ""fair"" to be done, evidently, the government-businesspeople also took 
real actions in the form of terror and threats to the local society. The first terror action was the destruction of the PPLP 
KP’s post by people who were referred to as accomplices of the government-businesspeople according to the society. 
The destruction of the PPLP KP’s post is considered by the society as a form of terror used to scare the local society 
for the refusal of the iron sand mining construction project. Not only the destruction of the PPLP KP’s post, but 
Garongan Village people also admitted that they had received attacks from hundreds of unknown people who did the 
destruction. Garongan Village is a base village against the iron sand mining construction project in the southern coastal 
area of Yogyakarta. According to the local society, the attack was not only a form of terror but also an attempt to 
divert the issue by the government-businesspeople so that the major issue in the form of the society’s social movement 
opposing the iron sand mining construction project were ignored. Although the society had received such terror, the 
society of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta remained steadfast in refusing the iron sand mining construction 
project without fear. 
 
The terror and threats did not stop, several local people were prosecuted by the government-businesspeople on charges 
of having taken seven employees of PT. JMI. For example, Mr. Tukijo, one of the people of the southern coastal area 
of Yogyakarta who opposes the iron sand mining construction project in the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta. Mr. 
Tukijo was detained (imprisoned) because he was accused of committing a criminal act. Although some of the people 
of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta were immobilized by the government-businesspeople, thousands of other 
people behind them were still strong and steadfast against the iron sand mining construction project in the coastal area. 
While some of these partisans were in detention cells, the local society admitted continuing to raise their hands together 
to pray for justice from Almighty God so that the partisans who were in the detention cells would always be given 
strength and fortitude, as well the people that struggled outside the detention cells were also given strength to fight 
the oppression and injustice. 
 
4.4 Disadvantages of the Society of the Southern Coastal Area of Yogyakarta 
The iron sand mining construction project in the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta is a form of new colonialism. 
The fact that there were evictions, oppression, threats, and intimidation experienced by the society of the southern 
coastal area of Yogyakarta become proof that national development is a form of terror for the middle to lower society. 
In general, the society that lives in the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta is placed as the object of power that can 
be played and treated by the government-businesspeople as they please in order to get big financial benefits. The 
financial benefits that will be obtained will certainly not be relished by the society in general, but the benefit will only 
be relished only by a handful of people, those are the elite government and foreign businesspeople as investors (Henry 
and Petras 2014). 
 
5. Conclusion 
The case of the society’s social movement conducted by the society of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta against 
the iron sand mining construction project actually occurs because of the differences in interests and perspectives 
related to the natural resources management. The government and businesspeople view that natural resources of the 
southern coastal area of Yogyakarta, especially in Kulon Progo Regency, is an object and asset belonging to the 
government that can be exploited to earn billions of rupiahs in profit each year. Meanwhile, the society of the southern 
coastal area of Yogyakarta views that the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta is the fertile land that they have managed 
for decades as a legacy from their ancestors. Moreover, the coastal land is the main source of livelihood for the local 
society which is used to fulfill the society’s daily needs. The society also views that changing the function of land into 
the iron sand mining area can damage nature which can cause major disasters that threaten the society's life. With this 
view, the society places nature as a subject that is able to give feedback on the treatment given, if nature is preserved 
and treated well, then nature will also provide the benefit in the form of providing sources of life that can be used to

meet the needs of daily life. However, if nature is exploited and treated badly, nature will also provide feedback in the 
form of disasters that can threaten the safety of the society. 
The national development concept promoted by the government in general are ""for the society’s welfare"", ""for the 
society’s benefit"", ""for the country’s development"", and so on. However, in the reality, national development done by 
the government eventually will only benefit a few people. In this case, the biggest share profit will definitely belong 
to PT. Jogja Magasa Iron, which is a foreign company (an Australian company) and partly owned by the elite 
government that is Yogyakarta Palace family. Apart from these two parties, the elite government of Kulon Progo 
Regency, which extremely supports the presence of the project to the point of being willing to put aside the society’s 
interests, will certainly also get the share of the profit. Apart from the parties above, it is certain that the society 
(especially that lives in the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta) will not be more prosperous but will be worse with 
the presence of the iron sand mining project. The land where they can earn daily income will be lost, the environment 
in which they live every day will be damaged, and they will feel the pollution every day as the impact of the iron sand 
mining project. 
The resistance movement conducted by the society of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta is actually a reaction to 
disappointment with the performance of the government. Instead of protecting the society and taking sides with the 
society’s interests, the government takes sides with businesspeople’s interests in order to obtain financial enefits. The 
resistance movement conducted by the society when it is viewed from the pattern actually is a form of reaction to the 
act of injustice, oppression, and intimidation done by the government-businesspeople. This bitter life experience that 
must be experienced by the society of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta has shaped the society to use the mind 
and physical in responding to the situation of injustice the society accepted.

Abstract 
Party autonomy is one of the critical indicators of political parties' institutionalization. The party's ability to be freed 
from other influences in managing its organizations and policies can assess how far the institutionalization of political 
parties is. Using a sequential-mixed method by combining quantitative analysis, which is elaborated more by the 
qualitative one, this study found that the management of party policies and internal conflicts still portray the influence 
of external factors. This external influence affects the party's independence while facing and resolving internal party 
conflict. Party autonomy is a severe challenge for party institutionalization because it will affect internal cohesion and 
solidity. Relatively, independent political parties will be able to manage their organizations and avoid intervention 
from external parties. 
Keywords 
Party Institutionalization, Party Autonomy, Party Organization, External Influences, and Cohesion. 
1. Introduction
Political parties are an essential element in democracy. Mainwairing & Scully and Pridham stated that the key to 
building democracy is strengthening democratic institutions; one of them is political parties (Fionna, 2013). The vital 
role of political parties in the democratic process cannot be separated from the party's internal dynamics. Randall said 
that political parties must be institutionalized to play an essential role in building democracy (Randall, 2006). With a 
high level of institutionalization, political parties are generally considered to positively impact democratic stability 
because they can help minimize conflicts (Scarrow, 2005). 
In terms of party institutionalism, it has many indicators. For example, based on a study conducted by Tomsa with the 
Golkar Party as the object of his research, one of the factors that driven better institutionalization of Golkar than the 
others is its long history as a hegemonic party during the authoritarian regime. In other words, the existence of a 
political party can contribute to how the party is institutionalized (Tomsa, 2008). Meanwhile, by analyzing the party 
organization at the branch level, Fionna (2013) found that daily administration and office management are the factors 
that determine the party's capacity to carry out its programs at the grassroots.  
The Center for Political Studies-LIPI also conducted a study of the institutionalization of political parties in Indonesia. 
This study analyzed the institutionalization of political parties concerning six aspects, namely: (1) ideology; (2) 
internal democracy, (3) regeneration; (4) internal cohesiveness; (5) relations with constituents; and (6) financial 
autonomy, related to party funding sources and party management mechanisms (Muchlis, 2007). Firman Noor (2015) 
also studied the institutionalization of Islamic political parties in Indonesia by looking at internal fragmentation and 
party cohesion. Several dimensions measured in his study was procedural leadership, internal conflict resolution, 
regeneration, ideology, and shared values. 
From the various indicators that can be used to analyze the institutionalization of parties above, this study focuses on 
the issue of how parties run their organizations independently. The independence of political parties, such as in the 
policy-making process, determining party leadership, and managing internal conflicts, are important indicators in the 
institutionalization of political parties to support the democratic process. If we ask about this autonomy to party 
members, we may get answers with positive connotations. However, in practice, political parties have not been entirely 
free from various interests. One of them that triggers the author to discuss more in this research is the matter of party 
independence in managing internal conflicts. Political parties often experience internal conflicts due to the party's

party can prevent interventions from an external influence, such as the direction and policies of the party. In this case, 
the party's organizational management will make party decisions relatively protected from external forces. 
A relatively similar thing is also depicted in the party court autonomy from external and internal influences. As stated 
in the previous section, the Party court is an institution that handles various internal party disputes. Through the 
existence of a party court, it is hoped that internal conflicts will become an area dealt with by the internal parties rather 
than involvement from outsiders. Thus, the Party court usually consists of cadres trusted to represent all interests in 
an internal dispute. When the party court can carry out its duties and has immunity from intervention from outside the 
court, the possibility of internal disputes can be handled. 
From the survey of party administrators, there are some critical points regarding party autonomy in the context of 
party institutionalization. First, party autonomy is the internal party ability to manage its organization to avoid 
intervention from external parties. It will be tested when the party has an institutional mechanism that internally 
supports its daily business. Second, the inability of political parties to institutionalize internal mechanisms in managing 
organizations, such as conflict resolution, shows that parties have not been able to sufficiently enforce the agreed 
internal mechanisms. The implication is that external parties can influence internal party’s conflict. This cannot be 
separated from the “party’s hospitality” to the external factor to be involved as they cannot resolve the conflicts 
internally. 
Suppose the party cannot deal with its conflict. In that case, this becomes a challenge for party institutionalization 
because external influences will be involved in every problem or conflict that arises. The institutionalization of the 
party emphasizes that the strength of the party is free from external intervention. The involvement of external parties 
in the management of party organizations makes the parties unable to determine their platforms and policies. The 
institutionalization of parties encourages parties to manage internal conflicts to maintain solidity from the potential 
that causes division. Party autonomy can also guarantee the party's constituents by showing them that the party they 
have chosen is indeed a well-managed institution that can channel people's various political aspirations and interests. 
6. Conclusion
As one of the crucial institutions of democracy, the institutionalization of political parties becomes an essential step 
for political parties to maximize their functions. This institutionalization covers one of the significant issues, namely 
party autonomy. Party autonomy describes how the party has the ability autonomously over various resources owned 
by the party. This capability requires the support of a solid internal mechanism for external influence, in this case, the 
intervention of parties outside the party to influence organizational policies or decisions. The internal perception of 
the party is mainly reflected in this study showing that the party is relatively independent of various opportunities that 
provide external parties to be involved in the organization. 
The challenge is how the party's autonomy in dealing with internal disputes. Although the party has mechanisms that 
can prevent the party from potentially splitting up, several internal party conflicts show that the party is still vulnerable 
to external party intervention. When external parties are involved in the business affairs of political parties, especially 
in resolving internal conflicts, the idealism, autonomy, and independence of political parties are questioned. When 
these three things are missing from a party, a political party becomes an organization with no design for a better policy 
change direction for a country. It happens because the party has intervened so that its ideology or platform that should 
be the party's footing has been blurred. Instead, the party grew into a political institution that would serve the needs 
of its patrons, not for the people, and the consolidation of democracy was threatened.

Abstract 
Football is favorable by Indonesian people, not only as sports. Although football is crucial in social life, it does not 
excite social scientists to conduct a comprehensive academic review. This article aimed to extensively review football. 
The review was carried out by examining football as a civilizing process involving individuals and a social structure. 
The notions are based on the viewpoint of football as a part of national human civilization through schools. The study 
results show that schools significantly contributed to the introduction and passion fostering for football. Schools have 
been proven to introduce football to young generations since the colonial era until today. Ultimately, football is a sport 
inseparable from its surrounding social world.  
Keywords 
Sportization, colonial, education, soccer, and soccerscape. 
1. Introduction
Football reviews in Indonesia from the social science perspective are considered charming wilderness. Football 
remains limited in research by social scientists, although it adheres to the daily life of Indonesian people. Football is 
inseparable from various aspects of social life; therefore, understanding football means understanding Indonesian 
people’s conditions. Although comprehension of football is considered valuable, reviews on football in Indonesian 
life remain limited.  
Soccerscape research in Indonesia are nothing new in recent years. Studies on the coverage of soccer, the playing 
soccer at an amateur level, the watching of soccer, or the making and consumption of soccer paraphernalia in this 
article are called soccerscape. Soccerscape exist at many different levels: from being a game paid on dirt pitches to a 
game watched on huge flat-screen televisions at luxurious cafes (Fuller, 2017, p. 1). Studies of soccerscape by 
Colombijn (1999 & 2000), Palupi (2000), Brawley (2012), Aji (2010 & 2013), Fuller (2016), Hadi (2017) Hakim, 
Yuliati, & Rinaldi (2017), and Harjo (2019, 2020) are small parts of studies conducted on national football. However, 
these works missed the explanation of the root cause of Indonesian people’s passion for football. Studies by 
Colombijn, Palupi, Brawley, and Aji cleverly demonstrated the historical aspect of football emergence in Indonesia. 
However, they did not explain the sustainability of such conditions in today’s setting. In contrast, studies by Fuller, 
Harjo, Hadi, and Hakim et al. could reveal current developments of football, even though their explanation ignored 
the football emergence aspect in Indonesia. These articles are not representative to explain the historical aspect and 
developments of football in Indonesia. Therefore, this study aimed to fill the research gap. 
This study is based on an argument that research in historical perspectives is salient to develop knowlegde about the 
emergence of football, development, and also establishment of this sport as the most popular one in Indonesia. This 
understanding should be derived from a systematic research for better understanding of soccerscape in Indonesia. This 
explanation is useful to describe and analyze the social problems that occur in Indonesian soccerscape nowadays. 
Therefore, those social problems can be solved based on precise identification towards the core of the problems and 
the alternative solutions.   
This article aimed to examine Indonesian people’s passion for football formally and meticulously. The review focuses 
on the process considered as the emergence of football to its current development in Indonesian schools. The focus 
on the importance of school was traced from the arrival of football in Dutch occupation until today. The tracing is 
urgent to acquire guidance on the dissemination of ideas and knowledge about football in school from time to time.

must practice basic locomotor, non-locomotor, and manipulative variations of motion following the concepts of body, 
space, effort, and connectedness in simple and/or traditional big ball games.  
 
Competencies 3.1 and 4.1 intend to integrate elements of knowledge and skills into the education of PJOK subjects. 
Both competencies are consistently present in classes IV, V, and VI. In practice, big ball games are carried out with 
mini volleyball game lessons in class IV, soccer is taught in class V, and basketball is learned in class VI (Masri’an 
& Aminarni, 2016; Sunarsih et al., 2009; Suwarjo et al., 2009). 
 
Competence to master big ball games that have been integrated into elementary school/MI education continues at the 
level of junior high school/MTs. Competency Standards of Physical Education Subjects of Junior High School explain 
that football games and sports are taught in grades VII, VIII, and IX (Listyarini, 2006, p. 34). The KD demanded from 
learners in class VII is still exactly like the KD at the elementary level. More substantial differences are seen in classes 
VIII and IX, contained in KD 3.1 and 4.1. There is an attempt to understand and practice specific motions in various 
simple and traditional big ball games in that competence. This competence has begun to incorporate aspects of strategy 
learning or movement in a football game.  
 
The ability to be more active in playing football at the high school/MA/vocational/MAK level in PJOK lessons. This 
capability becomes the mandate in KD 3.1 and 4.1 in classes X, XI, and XII. In class X, learners are encouraged to 
analyze and practice the analysis of the movement skills of one of the great ball games to produce good movement 
coordination. Furthermore, in-class XI, those abilities must develop so that students can analyze and practice the 
analysis of the movement skills of one of the big ball games and draw up an improvement plan. In class XII, learners 
are triggered to be more reliable by designing and practicing the attacking and defensive patterns of one of the big ball 
games.  
 
The description of the PJOK education curriculum above shows that formal schools have a systematic contribution to 
the spread of football in Indonesia. The curriculum containing KI and KD requires learners at all primary and 
secondary education levels to learn football in school. Formal education led by the government has maintained football 
as a lesson material at all levels. The condition introduces and fosters the passion of the Indonesian youth towards the 
game of football. 
 
A detailed review of the education curriculum mentioned above not only shows the spread of sports that are 
systematically carried out through formal schools. The search also provides important information about sports 
education that is carried out in Indonesia today. The revised 2013 curriculum in 2016 has provided space for traditional 
sports to be studied by Indonesian students. Traditional sports such as Pencak silat have been incorporated into the 
PJOK curriculum. The existence of traditional sports lesson materials can be an opportunity to develop sports that are 
not only based on the types of sports that come from outside Indonesia. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Civilizing process in the football milieu in Indonesia can be understood from the shifting that happened in Dutch 
colonialism. Native people previously adoring sport with physical contact to humans and animals then have slowly 
changed through school education. Schools for natives during the colonialism introduced and developed the 
Indonesian people’s fondness of football. Those kinds of efforts can be found in Indonesian school until today.   
 
Football as a form of sport cannot be separated from the social world that surrounds it. The presence of football in 
Indonesia has proven to be inherent in the process of colonization and modernization of people's lives. Gradually, 
football also permeated people's lives through formal education initiated by the colonial government. Then, the 
popularity of football found the right habitat when it was taught within the walls of schools and spread to society on 
a wider scale (Bourdieu, 1978, p. 832). However, without realizing that education created conditions that were not 
desired by the colonial government when football fans declared the establishment of a football association that had 
the spirit of nationalism, namely the All-Indonesian Football Association.   
 
A search of the history of football in Indonesia shows that sport is related to the life of a complex society. Indeed, the 
school has succeeded to be an institution that introduces and maintains people's interest in football through its sports 
education curriculum. However, other factors have accelerated the development and spread of the football game,

including the championship cup competition, mass media, and the emergence of professional players (Palupi, 2000). 
The development of football which is supported by the mass media and championships at the local, national, and 
international levels can be another challenge for social scientists who intend to explore the significant position of 
football in the lives of Indonesian society.

This study aims to establish an intelligent Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) with closed-loop control and 
self-optimization of process parameters. Empowered by a deep learning (DL) agent, the digital twin (DT) simulation 
can focus on the most significant process routes and eliminate 92.53% of unnecessary exhaustive iterations. On the 
other hand, DT can provide the most accurate simulation result for fast convergence to the optimal parameters of DL 
and no need to waiting for the result after the process completed. Though collaborative and autonomous interactions 
between DT and DL have been proposed recently, the practical integration of DT-DL and CPPS in the Electronic 
Manufacturing Service (EMS) industry has yet to be validated in official publications. With such novelty approach, 
the improvement of the production throughput (T/P) and rolled throughput yield (RTY) is 7.513% and 0.86%, 
respectively, which is on top of the contributions from traditional industrial engineering (IE) productivity tools.

1. Introduction
Traditional Industrial Engineering (IE) improvement tools such as Kanban (Reis et al. 2019), Value Stream Mapping 
(VSM) (Blume et al. 2020), Kaizen (Singh et al. 2009), LEAN system (Bradley and J. R. 2012), DMAIC in 6-sigma 
program (Burton et al. 2011) can have combined manufacturing productivity increment up to 42%. After adopting 
those tools and reaching their optimal settings, it is challenging to have dramatic improvement again. Also, some of 
these tools, like VSM and LEAN systems, are inevitably overlapping each other during implementation. In order to 
have productivity break-through, the modern Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) is adopted for further 
improvement. Deep Learning (DL) agents can find the missing links between the process parameters and the affected 
productivity, which humans might not be easily observed (Wang et al. 2018). The Digital Twin (DT) modeling can 
simulate the DL result (Elisa Negri 2017) and reduce the actual epochs in production iteration for fast convergence to 
its optimal value. By integrating both essential elements in DL and DT for smart manufacturing, self-configure, self-
adapt, and self-learn become possible. Which can significantly increase productivity, speed, flexibility, and efficiency 
(Jay Lee et al. 2020).  
Empowered by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) DL, the DT simulation in the CPPS can focus on the most 
significant process routes and eliminate 92.53% of unnecessary exhaustive iterations. On the other hand, DT can 
provide the most accurate simulation result for fast convergence to the optimal parameters of DL and no need to 
waiting for the result after the process completed. Though collaborative and autonomous interactions between DT and 
DL have been proposed recently (Jay Lee et al. 2020), the practical integration of DT-DL and CPPS in the EMS 
industry has yet to be validated in official publications. With the DT-DL novelty approach, the improvement of the

significantly reduce the training time. Although the results are encouraging, we still need more experience and wider 
implementation to optimize the DT-DL intergraded system. 
 
The DT-DL system can be further extended to the line and floor level with suitable DT and DL strategies. We can 
implement multiple robotic arms as a process selector for the Line level implementation and use the multiple agents' 
reinforcement learning strategy. At the floor level, we may implement this approach in cloud APS to schedule the 
SMT Line. The RNN-based DL can select the best-suited SMT line by product characteristics and process parameters. 
The DT will further enhance the DL by simulating the production thought-put and yield rate for rapid convergence to 
the optimized values. 
 
The major contribution of this study is to validate the theoretical DT-DL integration with CPPS in the EMS industry by 
operational data. Performance and training efficiency can be improved by combining DT and DL. By moving away 
from traditional methodologies and embracing Industry 4.0, the study case may be able to serve as an example that 
helps the industry move towards a successful future.

Abstract 
Company X is a service and production company in telecommunications and information technology (IT). At the 
end of 2021, Company X has a collaborative project, which is a refurbished project. During the execution of the 
project in previous terms, Company X often experienced delays in project completion or the deliverable in the 
contract was not achieved. One of the factors that caused delays due to several risks that occurred and had a large 
cost impact for handling them, so Company X could not handle risks immediately because they did not have a 
budget for risk mitigation. The purpose of this paper aims to estimate the value of contingency reserves for 
identified risk so it can anticipate the priority risks and prepare for the required budget if it happened. The method 
that will be used in this paper is Expected Monetary Value (EMV) and Tornado Diagram. EVM is statistical 
calculation to determine the cost that will be used in the future to overcome the risk that happens in a project. Based 
on this research, the results show that there are 34 risks that can be inserted to the contingency risk cost. The total 
cost required is US$5071.09 out of 0,1% of the total project budget. In addition, there are 5 risks that have the 
highest cost impact based on tornado diagram, including negative and positive risk. The top negative risks include 
delay in product delivery, defect product during delivery, additional request for product delivery, expired software 
license. However positive risk is also identified such as additional fund that may enhance for taking the opportunity.

1. Introduction
According to Sufa (2012), the key success of a project is always associated with time and cost as completion. In 
addition, one of the success factors in a project is whether the project achieves its goals or not (Project Management 
Institute, 2017). In project implementation, a discrepancy often occurs both in terms of the quality of the 
deliverables that are not achieved, the scope of work carried out is not appropriate, or implementation of project 
activities that are not according to schedule. Based on Project Management Institute (2017), one of the causes of

value, this indicates that the company will get funds for the value obtained. Information related to these five risks 
will be explained in more detail in the following diagram of the top 5 contingency reserves. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Top 5 of Contingency Reserves 
 
Based on the Figure 3, there are five highest risks that will be the main priority and focus for the project team. These 
risks are risk ID R1.9 with contingency reserves of US$ 1.773,70, risk ID R3.4 with contingency reserves of 
US$1.064,26, risk ID R1.10 with contingency reserves of US$881,70, risk ID R2.2 with contingency reserves of 
US$587,51, and risk ID R3.1 with contingency reserves of US$561,25. The five risks are described in a bar chart, so 
that the project team can monitor these risks so if that risk happens and project team can prepare a budget for the 5 
highest risks. 
 
So based on the results of the explanation of the three results, it can be seen how important contingency reserves are 
for companies in dealing with a risk. Contingency reserves are a quantitative aspect of a risk that can assist 
companies in preparing the required cost reserves if a risk happens. With contingency reserves, it will prevent 
schedules and costs at any risk from causing projects to get delayed or cost overrun. However, if this risk does not 
happen, then contingency reserves will not be used and will be stored for the next term. According to Shrivastava 
(2014), the purpose of a contingency reserve is to help the project team to increase project outcomes. Contingency 
reserves also assist project managers in optimizing risk management and preparing the project budget needed in the 
next term and communicating these results to stakeholders and sponsors. As for some limitations on the use of 
contingency reserves using the EMV method, the calculation results on the EMV can be different from the costs 
incurred in actual conditions. The EMV results are only used as a cost reference. If all contingency reserves occur, it 
will also have an impact on the budget (overbudget), and contingency reserves must be renewed if the risk register is 
updated. In addition, based on the England (2012) the contingency reserves that has been calculated cannot be used 
if there are major changes in scope of project. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Contingency reserves is a quantitative aspect of a risk that is important to do because it can help companies prepare 
the contingency reserves needed if a risk occurs. With contingency reserves, it will prevent schedules and costs at 
any risk from causing projects to experience delays and cost overruns. Based on the results of calculations using the 
EMV method, the results obtained are that there are 34 risks that are prepared for cost reserves if these risks occur. 
The total cost required for any risk which may occur and also handle is US$ 5.071,09 which is only 0,1% from the 
total project budget. This indicates that the refurbished project team must prepare cost reserves, so that if a risk 
occurs and requires a budget, the project team can immediately act without need to use the main project budget. For 
the next research, the risk assessment can use more integrated data for example project performance integration so 
all the stakeholders can monitor the risk movement and also more responsible for any risk that may threat to the 
project objectives.

Abstract 
In this study, we propose a heuristic method for obtaining a good approximate solution to job shop scheduling 
problems with bidirectional conveyance operations. In previous studies, there are heuristic solution methods and an 
exact solution method. The former are applicable only to problems with one way conveyance. The latter addresses 
problems with bidirectional transport, but it cannot solve medium to large scale problems in practical time. The 
objective is to minimize the makespan. The work order of jobs on each machine, crane assignment, and time to transfer 
job are determined. We consider a job shop scheduling problem with two cranes located in a straight line. All jobs are 
transported by one of the cranes to the machine between the two yards. The two cranes must maintain a safety distance 
of at least one address to avoid collision. Crane interference is a case in which the crane transfer time is longer than 
the minimum to avoid a collision. We seek a schedule that prevents crane interference. The unit time is a discrete 
value, which is the time it takes the crane to move one address. The positions of the yard, machine and crane are given 
by discrete addresses. We obtain good approximate solutions in multiple steps. We derive approximate solutions based 
on the MTWR rule and an effective machine assignment method for the flexible job store scheduling problem. The 
MTWR rule is a rule to select the job with the largest total remaining work time and transfer time for each job. In the 
first step, the work order of jobs on each machine is determined by selecting with a certain probability the MTWR 
rule and the random rule, respectively. Crane assignment is determined by selecting with a certain probability the 
CCFJ rule, the STTT rule, and the random rule, respectively. The CCFJ rule is a rule to select the closest crane from 
the job. The STTT rule is a rule to select the crane with the smallest total transfer time . If two jobs are to be transferred 
simultaneously, time to transfer job is determined by setting the time when both cranes transfer in the same direction. 
If the makespan is not updated T times, the process is terminated. In the second and subsequent phases, time to transfer 
job is determined based on the job order at each machine and crane assignments obtained in the first phase. Each crane 
transfers the job at the earliest transfer start time. If the makespan is updated, the solution is saved. If all processes are 
completed at the earliest transfer start time, the solution is output．Numerical experiments on several example 
problems have shown that the system successfully obtains good approximate solutions for some of the problems. In 
the future, we aim to construct a solution method that combines the proposed solution method and metaheuristics for 
medium and large scale problems.

Abstract 
Digital transformation (DT) of warehousing systems has become crucial for logistics firms in Saudi Arabia to become 
and remain competitive. It will help to streamline the supply chain and improve warehouse performance, which, in 
turn, will enable Saudi Arabia to be positioned as a global logistics hub. Therefore, the aim of this study is to 
investigate the antecedents of digitalisation and their impact on warehouse performance in Saudi Arabia. Data were 
collected from warehouse managers who are involved in the IT deployment. The study uses a fuzzy set qualitative 
comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach to analyse the collected data. The results show that achieving high warehouse 
performance in Saudi Arabia depends on the configurational effects of both resource orchestration theory (ROT) and 
digitalisation. Specifically, they reveal that digitalisation has the most significant effect on warehouse performance. 
This study will contribute to the theory by assessing the configuration design of the dimensions to gain an 
understanding of the digitalisation process. Additionally, it will guide managers to develop a step-by-step procedure 
for implementing the digitalisation process in their warehouses and assess the type and level of the resources required 
for the digitalisation of their warehouses. In addition, this study will help managers to clearly identify the various roles 
of digitalisation in improving performance.

1. Introduction
Digital transformation (DT) is defined as a process whereby digital technologies create disruptions that trigger 
strategic responses from organisations to alter their value creation paths (Vial 2019). DT is essential to fulfil growing 
customer expectations, reduce operating expenses, and maintain continued relevance in the market (Steiber et al. 
2020). Organisations are rapidly implementing DT in their operations (Cichosz et al. 2020), and it has become a key 
driver for organisations to improve operational efficiency and organisational performance. As such, warehouses

5. Discussion 
The study results indicate that ROT and digitalisation influence the performance of warehouses. Additionally, they 
show that ROT could improve performance since firms are often willing to enhance their ability to effectively manage 
their internal and external resources (Kristoffersen et al. 2021). This means that making better use of existing resources 
can lead to better performance, and this is consistent with the findings of a study conducted by Raghuram and Arjunan 
(2021). 
 
Furthermore, the results of the study confirm that digitalisation has a significant influence on warehouse performance. 
This suggests that a low level of adoption of digital technologies could lead to low performance, meaning that 
implementing digitalisation is considered critical for improving warehouse performance. This result is in line with 
those of previous studies that highlight the significant impact of digitalisation on performance (Truant et al. 2021; 
Verhoef et al. 2021). Hess et al. (2016) consider digitalisation as increasingly critical for firms’ success since it results 
in value creation, which leads to increased revenue, enhanced customer satisfaction, and access to new business areas. 
In addition, they suggest that digitalisation may lead to enhanced operational performance by improving the products 
and services, developing a new set of skills, and improving business processes.  
 
Overall, the high performance of warehouses in Saudi Arabia is dependent on the level of resources required for the 
digitalisation of warehouses. However, Saudi Arabia is only using some of the technologies and software to expedite 
the management process (Alias et al. 2018; AlMulhim 2021), which can be classified under digitisation or changing 
from analogue to digital systems (Saarikko et al. 2020). Therefore, there is an opportunity for Saudi warehouses to 
implement digitalisation. This is in line with Saudi Vision 2030, which suggests that they need to start implementing 
digitalisation. 
 
The study’s contribution to the theory is the assessment of the dimensions and the configuration design of the 
dimensions to gain a theoretical understanding of the digitalisation process. The study will guide managers to develop 
a step-by-step procedure for implementing the digitalisation process in their warehouses. It will also assist managers 
to assess the type and level of the resources required for the digitalisation of their warehouses. In addition, the study 
will help managers to clearly identify the various roles of digitalisation in improving performance.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Although many countries are implementing digitalisation for various reasons, research indicates that Saudi Arabia is 
still behind advanced economies in the contribution of their digitalisation to gross domestic product. Therefore, it is 
important to gain an understanding of the impact of digitalisation on Saudi warehouses. In the present study, our 
fundamental aim was to examine the digitalisation of warehousing and to investigate the effect of digitalisation on

warehouse performance in Saudi Arabia. ROT helps to explain the phenomena of DT and digitalisation. ROT 
processes would help the warehousing system to transform by implementing digitalisation. The results show that ROT 
and digitalisation could improve warehouse performance. Data have only been collected from one country, however, 
namely Saudi Arabia. This means that the results may vary in other developing countries.

Abstract 
Japanese school lunches are said to be more nutritionally balanced than those of other countries. This is due to the 
fact that school lunch menus are prepared in consideration of various items such as food categories and coloring of 
dishes. As a specific example, Japanese school lunches include not only meat-based dishes, but also rice and side 
dishes as part of the daily menu. In Japan, there is a style of cooking called Washoku. It is an expression of the Japanese 
people's respect for nature, and has been selected as an intangible cultural heritage because it is a traditional social 
practice that has been passed down from generation to generation. In the field of school lunch, there is a need for a 
system to support nutrition teachers in menu planning. There are many restrictions to be considered in menu 
preparation, such as nutritional intake standards, ingredient costs, and cooking time, and it takes a lot of time and 
effort to complete a menu. In Japan, the intake of 13 nutrients is determined according to the School Meal Intake 
Standards established by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT). Therefore, 
when preparing menus, it is necessary to keep within the upper and lower limits of the standard's intake. Previous 
research has proposed a menu planning model using a mathematical optimization solver that takes into account about 
70 different constraints. However, the model has two problems: First, it does not adequately take into account the 
frequency with which food items and dishes are served. Second, the solution time is too long (about 6,000 seconds). 
The second reason for this is the number of decision variables and constraints in a month, which are enormous: 
approximately 200,000 and 10,000, respectively. On the other hand, another previous studies using genetic algorithms 
(hereafter referred to as GAs) have produced menus in a relatively short time. However, the number of constraints 
considered is quite small (six), and the frequency of serving ingredients and dishes is not taken into account. In general, 
in GA, as the number of constraints increases, the solution generated by crossing becomes infeasible in many cases, 
and it is time-consuming to change to a feasible solution. In this study, we formulate an automatic menu creation 
model that takes into account the frequency of serving ingredients and dishes as a mathematical optimization problem. 
Using the tabu search method, we propose a heuristic solution method that can find a good solution in practical time

Abstract 
The advancement of Omni-Channel Retailing brings opportunities and challenges to traditional supermarkets. It is 
becoming more and more popular for omni-channel retailers to make use of local establishments to complete online 
customer orders. However, the complex store operational environment has brought huge challenges for online order 
fulfilment, which hinders the use of order picking optimization models of traditional warehouses in O2O 
supermarkets. Pickers responsible for online customer orders may encounter interference from in-store customers. 
One of the main interference situations is that pickers responsible for online customer orders may have to wait in 
queue with in-store customers during the peak period. This study, in particular, incorporates pickers’ waiting in queues 
during order fulfilment operations. We first analyze the similarities and differences in order picking processes between 
the traditional warehouse and O2O supermarkets, emphasizing the complex store operational features. We construct 
an order picking optimization model to minimize the total due time of online customer orders, with particular 
consideration of pickers’ possible queuing time. An efficient heuristic is proposed to resolve the optimization model. 
Furthermore, this paper discusses the effect of various factors, i.e., the quantity of order, the calculation method of 
queuing length and order picking methods, on order fulfilment performance in different computational environments. 
Numerical experiments were carried out and experimental results were statistically analyzed. The computational 
experiments evidence the effect of order batching, order quantity, and possible waiting time in queues on online order 
fulfilment performance. The lack of consideration of customer interference may significantly impair order fulfilment 
performance. Lastly, managerial suggestions were put forward for O2O supermarket operations.

Abstract 
The paper aims to propose a model for production possibilities frontier for commodities of an enterprise. The 
motivation of the paper is to contribute to one of the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, which 
is to reduce carbon footprint towards the net zero emissions by 2050. A Multi Objective Optimization is used in the 
study, to help managers decide what mix of products to produce in order to minimize the production costs and carbon 
dioxide emissions with their current resources. Data in the model comes from a case study company to have numerical 
parameters and test the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model. The input parameters and all constraints 
mentioned in the study was transformed into mathematical model and was coded in Linear programming software. 
The results show a Pareto Optimal mix of products or production possibility frontier in which the optimum solution 
points are converged within the boundary of their resources.

1. Introduction
The concept of sustainable development was formally introduced in UN report Our Common Future (Development, 
1987). Likewise, in year 2000, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provides a development 
paradigm about sustainable development. In 2015, the Paris Agreement by 196 member parties committed to 
transformed the trajectory of sustainability to limit global warming to below 20C, above pre –industrial levels (UN, 
2021). In order to meet these goals, the carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced by 45% by 2030 from 2010 levels 
and reach net zero emissions by 2050 (UN, 2021).  
There is a strong concern for implementing sustainable development in all business activities and human activities. 
Sustainable development is defined as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Drexhage & Murphy, 2010). Resource scarcity and 
environmental pollution have increasingly a major concern globally. Strict regulations and the demand for innovations 
have driven organizations to implement sustainable practices (Yacob P. et al 2019). Manufacturing is a critical 
contributor to a country’s economic growth, consequently, the integration of sustainable production systems should 
be implemented in the complete life cycle of the products (Belhadi et al, 2020). 
Carbon footprint measures the products or services environmental impact on global warming. It is the total gas 
emissions caused by companies, product or person. Manufacturing companies had been a major source of global 
carbon emission (Olantunji et al, 2019). Sustainable development is link to manufacturing and consumption of both 
goods and services to reduce carbon footprint. Organizations are forced to integrate reduction of carbon footprint as 
part of their operational strategies. Some of the motivating factors are regulation (Lee, 2012) and evolving 
environmental criteria as basis for being competitive (Baumgartner & R., 2018). The future product demands are 
linked to the manufacturing and consumption of goods and services, which lead to sustainable development and 
reduction of carbon footprint. This paper supports business goals of having a sustainable production system which 
considers the achievement of two objectives, the production costs and the production carbon footprint. Furthermore,

Using the input parameters and all constraints mentioned, the model was coded in Linear programming software to 
compute for the decision variables and the objective functions. Figure 1 and Figure 2 are the results of the mathematical

The single function value of this multiobjective problem was computed below where multi objective function Min 
Q(deviations) equation was used. This objective function was set to minimize the percentage deviation from the target. 
Since solution 2 has a smaller deviation, the study chooses solution 2 which will serve as product mix planning 
schedule or the production possibility frontier. The solution 2 identifies the quantity of product i to be produced at 
production facility/plant j. In this case, 825 units of product 1 should be produced at plant 1 (i.e. X11 = 825). Product 
1 should not be produced in plant 2 (X12 = 0). Plant 3 should produce 650 units of product 1(X13 = 625). And so on 
and so forth. With the given units of product i to be produced at plant j, the overall total production cost of the company 
considering the resulted production plan is 69, 765 Php. This is for the monthly basis. At the same time, the carbon 
footprint is 15, kgs. 297.. Hence, it was validated that solution 2 is the optimal solution with 0.04 deviations from the 
target value. 
6. Conclusion
The study found an optimal solution for the production possibility frontier of the case study company. The single 
function value of this multiobjective problem was computed and solution 2 will served as product mix planning 
schedule. The proposed model resulted in a pareto optimal for the achievement of the 2 objectives which are to 
minimize production cost and ,at the same time minimize carbon footprint. The feasibility of the model and its 
effectiveness in achieving the goals of the company are demonstrated in the proposed model.

Abstract 
Manila Bay is considered as one of the best locations to experience sunset, visitation for relaxation, and a place for 
gathering. However, the constant draining and dump coming from different industrial sectors has developed to a bay 
which constitutes to high level of pollutions. The need to address the issue with regards to water body pollution has 
been underexplored. The paper investigates several fecal coliform reduction methods: the use of secondary and tertiary 
treatments like sand filtration and UV disinfection processes bolstering activated sludge processes, membrane 
bioreactor technology systems, and intermittent filtering. The following methods were examined to resolve Manila 
Bay’s Bathing Beaches’ high fecal coliform levels. The use of intermittent filtering with the filter media of unsorted 
sand yielded the highest reduction rate of 6.3 log10 compared to common activated sludge processes averaging only 
0.38 log10. The mitigation of the bays could potentially reduce ecological and environmental problems. Food, water, 
and energy are primary concerns for a country’s sustainability. With the involvement of pollution, the rise of capital 
scarcity would be evident which would reduce businesses, development, livelihood, and eventually the quality of life. 
The need to promote and mitigate water of bodies such as bays is therefore highly important for management. Thus, 
policymakers and government sectors may take this into consideration for promotion and conservation of natural 
resources.

1. Introduction
Manila Bay is often touted as one of the most significant water bodies of the Philippines. Manila Bay is located in the 
western part of Luzon bounded by Cavite and Metro Manila on the east, Bulacan and Pampanga on the north, and 
Bataan on the west and northwest. The Manila bay’s Southern part opens to the South China Sea. Spanning 190 
kilometers, the bay drains about 17,000 km2 of watershed area constituting 26 catchments. The bay’s northern part is 
especially susceptible to lahar (a rapidly flowing mudflow of rock debris that originates from volcano slopes) 
discharges. The western coast receives discharges from Bataan watersheds and the bay’s Eastern side receives river 
flow originating from Cavite and Bulacan. However, the focus of this study will be on the eastern coast, being 
susceptible to polluted runoffs coming from the Pasig River – a product of industry effluent mismanagement. It is also 
important to note that sediment rates from Cavite and Manila were consistently high which heavily suggest these areas 
act as sinks of sediments and collect bay pollutants (Jacinto et al. 2006). 
Manila Bay is considered as one of the best locations to experience sunset, visitation for relaxation, and a place for 
gathering. However, the constant draining and dump coming from different industrial sectors has developed to a bay 
which constitutes to high level of pollutions (Moaje, 2022). To which, the recent protocol to help mitigate the bay and 
developing the “Miami” Bay feel for tourist was implemented (Moaje, 2022). Despite the increase plans to promote

the Most Probable Number technique in evaluating effluent concentrations (Table 1). It is a method that estimates the 
number of bacteria in a water sample. Despite this widely used technique, external factors such as sunlight intensity 
can distort the actual yield of fecal coliform (Kim et al. 2014).

Note: DAO 2016-08 water quality standard for fecal coliform Class SB is 100MPN/100mL 
Spanning 2017 to 2022, there have only been a few instances where coliform standards were satisfied. There was an 
anomalous 2020 fecal coliform level of Dalaroy’s Resort 28MPN/100ml that subscribed to the DAO standard followed 
by the first quarter of the 2022 fecal coliform levels of Villa Leonara, Villa Carmen, and Dalaroy’s Resort satisfying 
the standard with 99MPN/100ml, 8MPN/100ml, and 57MPN/100ml, respectively. In the second quarter, Dalaroy’s 
Resort’s fecal coliform levels increased to 100MPN/100ml which is considered within the standard advised by the 
DAO. However, it is important to consider that these results may have been affected by the reduced number of people 
using bathing beaches due to the pandemic.  
4. Conclusion and Recommendations
Thus, implementing these changes may help mitigate Manila Bay’s Bathing Beaches’ fecal coliform levels. The use 
of refrigerated wastewater systems to cool the system’s temperature can be implemented but are rather costly. 
Furthermore, parameters must be instilled to restrict raw wastewater from entering plants such as the use of sand to 
further sift through pollutants. This links to the use of UV disinfection coupled with sand filtration, which can serve 
as the secondary and tertiary treatment processes of fecal coliform reduction levels with a typical primary treatment. 
Also, the conventional use of activated sludge seemed inferior to many other treatment processes such as lagooning. 
If intermittent filtering processes are favored, the filter media used is crucial in maximizing the time of moving wetter 
front, which impart increased retention time just as pressure dosed systems did.  Thus, future studies scrutinizing the 
implementation of intermittent filtering using unsorted sands within the context of a tropical, heavily-urbanized bay 
can be examined. This may help determine if the effectiveness of unsorted sand as a filter media is unaffected by the 
Manila Bay climate or its water conditions.

The mitigation of the bays could potentially reduce ecological and environmental problems. Since bays in general are 
a crucial natural landscape, the promotion and conservation of it is highly important. This body of water can efficiently 
consume shortwave radiation through evaporation; which is crucial for hot condition climate. Since the body of water 
help in mitigating urban environment and balance the climate effect, the need to manage its condition, health, and 
overall status should be considered for the benefit of the community. Food, water, and energy are primary concerns 
for a country’s sustainability (Spielberg et al. 2017). It has been indicated that natural capital would be the most 
expensive resources our current generation have. With the involvement of pollution, the rise of capital scarcity would 
be evident which would reduce businesses, development, livelihood, and eventually the quality of life. The need to 
promote and mitigate water of bodies such as bays is therefore highly important for management. Thus, policymakers 
and government sectors may take this into consideration for promotion and conservation of natural resources.

Abstract 
The purpose of the current manuscript is to discuss the application experiences of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) process 
improvement methodology in defect reduction. The work discussed in the manuscript pertains to the results that were 
obtained in the quality control improvement project of the 50Kg Bagging Plant process of Kalahari Ash Processing 
Company, Botswana, to eliminate product defects. The defects in this case, were defined as the 50 kg filled salt bags 
not meeting the expected standard weight as per customer specifications. At any given month, these defects amounted 
to an average of 17.6% of the total production output with a yearly customer compensation loss of about US$40 000. 
Several LSS tools were applied within the DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) process 
improvement methodology from defining the problem through control and up to recommendations that could eliminate 
the process defects. Tools such as SIPOC (Supplier-Input-Process-Output-Customer) diagrams, Process Maps, Cause 
and Effect diagrams, Process Capability Analysis and Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (Gage R&R) were 
applied in the project.  A Solution Selection Matrix was then applied to provide concrete recommendations to eliminate 
the identified process defects. Through Stability, Linearity and Bias tests the results showed that the weighing 
equipment was a major source of process variation leading to the observed percentage defects. This variation was due 
to several factors, one of which was the frequency and timing of the calibration of the weighing equipment. The 
analysis showed that, by changing the frequency and timing of the calibration of the equipment, a significant defect 
reduction percentage and improvement in customer satisfaction ratings could be achieved.

1. Introduction
Defects are defined as products that fail to meet customer specifications or expectations and may lead to many 
customer complaints (Gijo et al 2018; Saleh et al 2018). Parts, assemblies, or products that do not conform and are 
consequently unusable or require rework are classified as defects (Lachance, 2018). Defective products must usually 
be replaced; they necessitate paperwork and human effort to handle; they risk losing consumers; and the resources 
invested in the defective product reworks are usually wasted because it is not utilized productively. Production wastes 
can be reduced or eliminated using Lean Six Sigma concepts (Dora and Gellynck, 2015). According to Pyzdek (2010) 
if the right methodology structure of LSS is effectively integrated and applied, the intended project under consideration 
will significantly succeed. Lean six sigma comprises of two methodologies, namely Lean Manufacturing methodology 
and the Six Sigma Methodology. 
Six Sigma is a process improvement methodology that focuses on reducing variation (Desai et al 2015) while Lean 
was created to maximize resource usage by reducing waste (Sundar et al 2014). As a result, the Lean Six Sigma 
concepts together aid in improving the process efficiency and quality (Rastogi, 2020).  Six Sigma began in Motorola's 
production division, where millions of parts were manufactured using the same procedure repeatedly (Prajapati & 
Desai, 2014). While the Lean concept is generally discussed as originating from the Japanese industry, particularly 
from the Toyota motor company. Today Lean Six Sigma concepts have been used in a variety of industries, including

3.4 Improve 
Following the results obtained and the analysis done, a Solution Selection Matrix (SSM) was employed to formulate 
a cost-effective solution to solve the observed problem. The proposed solutions that followed a brainstorming exercise 
included repairing of load cells, recalibration of the load cells, cleaning the inside of the weigher, and replacing the 
load cells. Through the SSM the recalibration of the load cells using either the International Organization of Legal 
Metrology (OIML) RII F1 Class or the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E617-13 Class 1 was 
identified to be the best solution in overall. The solution was arrived at taking into consideration several factors which 
included the potential to meet the goal, cost to implement and time that could be required to implement the solution. 
Although cleaning the inside of the weigher to remove accumulated salt dust was also a potential solution, it was 
believed it could contribute to drift and bias in measurements, and its effectiveness could be low depending on how it 
is done.  
 
3.5 Control 
To sustain the improvements after recalibrating the load cells, a thorough monitoring and control plan was suggested. 
This could be done by adopting a new paradigm of calibration and maintenance. This new regime should include daily 
data collection sessions to monitor system performance with the use of rational subgrouping data. By employing SPC 
charts, the process monitoring could ensure the organization gets to see the changes and drifts in the process output in 
time and allow recalibration and maintenance of the load cells before defective products are produced. This way the 
recalibration and maintenance could be done according to the voice of the process rather than being done during plant 
wide shutdowns as it with the current regime. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The current manuscript discussed the application of Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology in solving real life practical 
problems by careful selection of the LSS tools and the systematic procedure of utilizing these tools throughout the life 
of a project.  Production challenges that were experienced by the case study company were fully investigated and a 
solution was recommended to address the challenges that were experienced. The approach adopted in the study and 
solutions recommended can be applied to similar processes to potentially reduce production defects in similar settings.

Abstract 
Currently, the Peruvian textile sector, especially the MSMEs and SMEs, is affected by several factors that have 
lowered its productivity. This industry is already dealing with complex markets for a high level of competitiveness 
and informality. For this reason, it is imperative to counteract these factors internally affecting the companies' 
operating processes. Most companies, intending to lower costs, seek to hire personnel with a certain level of experience 
since it is assumed that they would support them in carrying out the work in their position, meaning that the personnel 
hired are not trained to perform their tasks. Likewise, maintenance is minimized or non-existent, and plants are not 
adequately organized. All these factors result in a decreased level of productivity. This paper seeks to demonstrate that 
regular training, planned maintenance, and proper plant layout will reduce the negative effects mentioned above. For 
this purpose, there are specific tools available that will be mentioned in this article, such as SLP, Autonomous 
Maintenance and/or Planned Maintenance (TPM), Poka Yoke, and Standardized Work, as they will be implemented 
for intervention in the production process in a company aimed to manufacture sleepwear, where an increase of 14% 
in their productivity level was achieved. 
Keywords 
Standardized Work, SLP, TPM and Poka Yoke. 
1. Introduction
When talking about the textile industry, it is essential to mention the clothing manufacturing industry since they are 
highly related, and there are studies indicating that around 50% is destined for the clothing industry, and the rest, for 
industrial and household products (Alvarado & Vieyra, 2002). This industry represents the most important source of 
income for developing countries; such is the case that in 2001, it accounted for 2.5% and 3.3% of world trade in 
merchandise and manufactured goods, respectively (Angulo, 2000). Currently, the value and quality of textile products 
have evolved positively. They have become very attractive for businessmen in the main markets of the world, such as 
China, the United States and Colombia (Rosales, 2019). In Peru, the raw material has been used to good advantage 
thanks to the diversity of the altitudinal floors and the expertise of local artisans (Proinversion, 2005). SMEs have a 
very important value because they are responsible for making a great contribution to increasing the employment rate 
and national production. However, due to the high level of informal and foreign competition, such as Chinese 
production with low labor and material costs, the challenge of remaining active and surviving in the market is a daily 
struggle, as it requires greater investment in technologies and new product design proposals (Morón and Serra, 2010). 
The literature reviewed allowed to determine that MSMEs in Peru face different problems that directly affect and 
restrict their future development (Sauser, 2005). At the same time, it is the responsibility of these entities to develop 
short and medium-term strategies and skills; all this to be able to face and not decline before the different and difficult 
situations and scenarios that new entrepreneurs have to face (Barba et al. 2007). Such

6. Conclusion 
Table 2 shows the most importants indicators. The increase in these indicators means a negative effect on 
productivity. However, it can be seen that they were reduced after the improvement was made, making a positive 
impact. Likewise, in Table 3, we can observe a significant reduction in cost and an increased in the units produced. 
In conclusion, the study carried out on the Peruvian sleepwear manufacturing SME achieved the established objective 
of this paper, which is to improve the company's production process using the described engineering tools. Thanks to 
standardized work, cycle times in production are reduced. As for the Poka Yoke, by preventing errors in the processes, 
the percentage of defective products is reduced. With respect to the SLP, it was possible to reduce the total route time; 
finally, with the results of the TPM, it was decided to train the operators regarding the management of the autonomous 
and planned maintenance of the machines used in the production line.

Abstract 
Currently, Peruvian textile companies have played a very important role in the national economy, therefore, 
they are constantly seeking to implement production design strategies that allow them to obtain optimum 
efficiency. Accordingly, this scientific paper aims to increase efficiency in the finishing area by implementing 
a production model based on Lean-TPM. The results obtained can be of great value for textile industries, 
especially for those who wish to improve the efficiency of their operations, avoid waste and increase 
productivity. Therefore, the commitment to adopt new ways of working starts from the highest levels of 
management down to the operators, and it is important to integrate all members of the production team, because 
it will lead to achieve great economic benefits and be more competitive in the textile market. This article refers 
to the implementation of autonomous maintenance based on lean six sigma in a fabric production company 
where an increase from 78% to 80% in the efficiency of the finishing area was achieved.

1. Introduction
Internationally, China is considered the world's largest textile manufacturer with a global share of 39.2% in 
2019, being the sixth largest energy consumer and the third largest discharger of wastewater, where the 
economic growth of textile industry is achieved by competing for energy consumption as well as ecological 
depletion (Gai et al., 2022).  The textile industries in China consider the availability of machinery, the 
availability of manpower, and the willingness of labour to minimise costs as fundamental capital for the 
development of operations (Dong et al., 2022). As well as the managers of textile industries in Honduras are 
reluctant to maintain adequate knowledge of the methods that guarantee the order of industrial procedures, since 
employees share a mentality that working without any rules makes them more efficient (Mohan et al., 2020). 
Also, industries in the Americas face great challenges in minimising operating costs due to market 
inconsistency, competition and external demands (Mbogo, 2019). At the national level, the textile sector is a 
highly competitive market and is considered one of the main economic engines of the country, providing more 
than 463 thousand jobs represented by 7.4% of GDP (Barzola et al., 2021). Therefore, the economic challenges 
it faces are based on the increasing global competition in the perspective of production, management and 
technological processes, as well as consumer expectations (Sourav et al., 2020). 
It is of great importance to consider the Lean methodology in the production processes of the textile sector, 
since many of the companies lack specialised human resources that allow a correct performance in the main 
processes (Vieria et al., 2018). The development of textile industries has allowed competition to become more 
acute, due to the fact that, in order to maintain a competitive position, it is necessary to keep their production 
effectiveness at the highest level (Sakti et al., 2019). On the other hand, to increase efficiency in textile 
industries, it is required to reduce manufacturing defects and the time to manufacture the product, highlighting 
the Lean methodology for the reduction of waste generated in the manufacturing process, so as to reduce the

It is important to have the historical information of the machine, in order to re-evaluate the indicators and in 
this way propose the integration of engineering tools to be adapted as a model that can be replicated and 
contribute to maintenance management.

Abstract 
Rural hospitals are a crucial component of the US healthcare system as more than half of all US hospitals located in 
hospital regions considered as rural. Rural hospitals are faced with many challenges including low patient volumes, 
geographic isolation, hindrances for attracting and retaining skilled employees, and the lack of access to capital 
compared to their urban counterparts. Further, rural hospitals are typically more vulnerable to the effects from its rural 
operating environments such as: the declining population; economic stagnation; disproportionate number of elderly, 
poor, and underinsured residents; and high rates of chronic illness. These issues directly impact the financial 
performance and stability of the rural hospitals threatening their survival. Nonetheless, it is critical to maintain the 
rural hospital network, as one in five Americans rely on their services. This research is thus having the objective of 
formulating a methodology to identify systemic issues related to the financial performance of rural hospitals. The 
findings lead us to systematically arrive at improvement recommendations. We use Pennsylvania hospital data from 
2000-2020 to demonstrate the methodological application. Initially, we identify if the Pennsylvania rural hospitals are 
having significantly different performances than the urban hospitals. As part of our methodology, we employ 
descriptive, statistical, and visual analyses to apprehend the rural hospital performance over the two-decades, and to 
unveil potential causal relationships. Then, we use the system dynamics (SD) modeling and analysis approach to verify 
and explain the significant causal relationships. The methodological demonstration ends with the recommendations 
for improving rural healthcare hospital systems, which are based on the SD model analysis results.

Abstract 
This research analyzed the problem of broken products that negatively affect retail construction finishing companies. 
For this reason, the study was conducted in a retail company in the mentioned sector. The main problem is broken 
ceramic tiles found throughout the logistics process. This company has a rate of product breakage of 2.15%, equivalent 
to 707,704.58 PEN in total cost and costs involved. The leading causes of this problem are poor storage and 
transportation of products 26.32% and inadequate control and handling of products 27. 03% and poor handling with 
the forklift 25.97%. A model was formulated under the Lean Manufacturing and warehouse management methodology 
divided into three stages for the implementation of the tools: ""Order and Stability,"" which consists of the performance 
of the 5S combined with warehouse management tools, and ""Planned Flow,"" which focuses on the implementation of 
SLP, and the last phase is called ""Make Kaizen Flow"" which focuses on the combination of standard work and the 
Kaizen Philosophy. Finally, through a simulation, it is determined that the application of this model reduces the main 
problem to 1.65% and allows standardizing activities and improving the order and distribution of the warehouse. This 
research will be an example for future implementations for companies in the retail sector of construction finishes.

1. Introduction
The retail sector worldwide is marketing millions of products per day, which demands complete care so that these 
products can arrive intact at their distribution (Barrientos-Ramos et al. 2020). This article highlights the importance 
of decreasing the number of damaged products in distribution centers and increasing the efficiency and resources 
needed in the retail sector. With the implementation of a methodological approach, the impact that this generates on a 
country's economy is made known. For example, in Peru, the retail industry represents 10.7% of the Gross Domestic 
Product and 25.8% of the national Economically Active Population (El comercio retail representa el 10.7% del PBI 
del Perú 2019). Within this sector, the ceramic industry grew by 12.36% in 2020 due to the great demand of the 
construction sector, which requires these products to finish the aesthetics of their projects. On the other hand, research 
based on statistical data from retail companies engaged in the retail marketing of products manages to receive 1.86% 
of defective products per year in their establishments (Vásquez Médico et al. 2018). Consequently, this evidences that 
the retail sector has certain types of limitations with the improvement of this indicator, making its profitability lower 
than planned. 
According to the bibliographic guides, the problem identified is that there is no constant and adequate quality control 
and a lack of standardized methods in the performance of the tasks. Consequently, the products are damaged in the 
warehouses. This problem has been identified in other research at a global level, such as in Latin American countries 
like Argentina, which indicates that in the retail sector of ceramic products, the percentage of defective products 
exceeds 2.89% in most of the companies in this area. The leading cause is the lack of implementation of tools for

analyzer, Lean Manufacturing tools were implemented in the improvement proposal, and an additional activity was 
added for the proper storage of products. As a result, the model shows the improvement of product integrity and 
reduced time and distances for the forklift transfer processes, which involves less time for handling the products. 
Quality control and work standards were also implemented for the reception and dispatch activity, evidenced in less 
standard time at the simulation's time. In addition, the leading indicator, the percentage of ceramic tiles breakage, 
decreased to 1.65%.

The Table 3 shows that with a 95% confidence level, the improved indicator of picking time and forklift transport 
time with product show a significant difference in the current model, so positive results are expected. However, for 
the primary indicator of breakage percentage, there is an overlapping of the minimum with the maximum, so it is 
necessary to compare the means. Furthermore, the output analyzer report obtained that for this indicator, the null 
hypothesis is rejected, so there is a significant difference. In other words, this indicator is reduced for the improved 
model. Through the statistical validation, it is evident that applying the tools under the improvement model helps 
improve the indicators related to the problem and reduces the percentage of breakage of ceramic tiles (Figure 8 and 
Figure 9).

6. Conclusion 
Implementing Lean manufacturing and Lean Kaizen methodology tools such as 5S, SLP, and Standard Work in 
conjunction with warehouse management allows positive results in a retail sector company that sells construction 
finishing products. After setting up the model and performing the simulation, the tile breakage indicator improves to 
1.65% of the total area of products sold, and the improvement of each indicator is related to the problem. This 
optimization translates into higher profitability for the company. In conclusion, the present research's objective was 
to improve the indicator of ceramic tile breakage, which is presented as the company's main problem under study.

Abstract 
The 4th industrial revolution (4IR) has caught the attention of many researchers and organizations around the world 
and they have started to work towards the implementation of such technological advancement. Saudi Arabia has caught 
the attention of local industries in the implementation of 4IR technologies. However, local oil and gas companies may 
encounter challenges that affect their business in implementing 4IR technologies. This paper aims to identify 
challenges affecting the implantation of 4IR technologies in the oil and gas sector. Several challenges have been 
identified in this study based on the literature and experts interviewed. Data were collected and analyzed using 
descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify, analyze and justify the main 
challenges affecting the implementation of the 4th industrial revolution technologies in oil and gas companies in Saudi 
Arabia. The top 5 ranked challenges were identified as having ‘security issues as the first and main challenge, 
following are ‘low 4IR understanding’, ‘Lack of integration of technology platform’, ‘Lack of global standards and 
data sharing protocols, and ‘Lack of government support and policies. Tackling these top 5 main challenges now will 
provide a clear path to implementing the 4th industrial revolution technologies in local oil and gas companies.

1. Introduction
Organizations have recently focused on finding new ways to improve their business methodologies in order to reduce 
costs and increase productivity. They try to improve and modernize their work procedures and information-gathering 
methods. Oil and gas industries tend to digitalize and incorporate the technology in tier processes. In the upstream 
sector, the oil and gas industry relies heavily on technology for identifying geological locations and heavy equipment 
to extract oil and gas, as well as raw data and statistics. The downstream sector, on the other hand, can be more 
complex because it relies on the upstream sector to provide enough raw data to manipulate the source of material into 
a meaningful product. 
Nowadays, the use of the internet has been growing dramatically, where all things can be connected.  A thriving 
element that is believed to be the beginning of the 4th industrial revolution (4IR), connecting most of the physical 
aspects with digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics and Drones, Automation, Industrial 
Internet of Things (IIOT), Cloud Computing, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Cybersecurity and more. This defines 
the objectives and aspects of the 4th industrial revolution, which focuses solely on transforming the way we live and 
work from the current habits that we now abide by to a more advanced and easier lifestyle. 
Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer which caters to around 17% of the world’s petroleum reserves 
announced the development of the project NEOM in October 2017, which is heavily involved in the 4th industrial 
revolution technologies and is part of Saudi Arabia’s vision of 2030. This announcement, along with other similar 
projects, encourages the implementation of new technologies in businesses, which will hopefully result in a better 
business outcome. Implementing the 4th industrial revolution technologies in the oil and gas industry may encounter 
challenges that frustrate the industry in achieving the goals of 4IR.

4.5 Findings Summary 
Survey data was collected and conducted descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and hypothesis testing to 
identify, analyze, and justify the challenges respectively. The findings of this study show that the top five most 
challenging factors for implementing the 4th industrial revolution technologies in oil and gas companies in Saudi 
Arabia as shown in Table 9 are: (1) Security issues, (2) Low 4IR understanding, (3) Lack of integration of technology 
platform, (4) Lack of global standards and data sharing protocols, and (5) Lack of government support and policies.

Identifying the main challenges that are impacting the growth of 4IR implementation in oil and gas companies in 
Saudi Arabia shows that finding a resolution to tackle these issues would open up greater paths to successful and 
achievable 4IR implementation goals. 
5. Conclusion
This paper identified and highlighted the challenges of Industry 4.0 implementation in the oil and gas sector. These 
challenges were identified based on the literature and expert interviews. A survey/questionnaire was then developed 
which consists of 3 sections, demographics, company behavior towards 4IR, and 4IR challenges. The main purpose 
of this paper was to identify the main challenges affecting the 4th industrial revolution implementation in local oil and 
gas companies. The identified 17 challenges from the literature were utilized in the survey, in addition to a few more 
reasonable challenges added which accumulates to 20 challenges in total. The survey results were then collected and 
analyzed through descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify, analyze, and 
justify the main challenges affecting 4IR implementation in local oil and gas companies. 
The findings indicated that ‘security issues’ is the main challenge towards the implementation of 4IR technologies in 
local oil and gas companies, along with ‘low 4IR understanding’, ‘Lack of integration of technology platform’, ‘Lack 
of global standards and data sharing protocols’, and ‘Lack of government support and policies. Tackling these top 5 
main challenges now will provide us with a clear path in implementing the 4th industrial revolution’s technological 
goals. Oil and gas companies in Saudi Arabia don’t seem to have any financial issues, their main concern is more 
about the adaptability of applications which may affect the security of such implementation.

Abstract 
Investor interest in the Circular Economy (CE) is growing. Investment in CE has exceeded $1.3 trillion, and the 
issuance of related equity funds and sovereign debt has increased several-fold each year after 2018. One of the reasons 
investors are interested in CE is that it is expected to contribute to the climate change mitigation. It has been noted 
that while about 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are derived from energy use, the remaining 45% come 
from product manufacturing and food production. Conversion of energy use is not sufficient to limit temperature rise 
to below 2°C, which is currently a mainstream action for climate change under Paris Agreement. This gap can be 
resolved through transition to CE. The TCFD recommendation, a disclosure framework for climate-related 
information, recommends disclosing the development of CE-related solutions in the climate-related opportunities 
section. Recently, the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation and governments have been working 
together to promote mandatory disclosure of climate-related information. Understanding the CE information in 
climate-related disclosures is therefore important for the process of transition to CE. The purpose of this study is to 
clarify how CE information is addressed in corporate climate-related disclosures. Textual analysis is employed as the 
research method for this purpose, and the analysis is complemented by interview research. Among the companies 
registered with TCFD Supporters, those belonging to the chemical industry were selected for the analysis, and it was 
found that 55 of 94 companies disclosed TCFD information. This is because these companies deal with the production 
of plastics, which are a major point of contact for CE and climate-related information, especially in the short term. 
We, first, analyze textual data from the TCFD disclosures of these companies and, based on these results, interview 
individual companies. The results of the analysis showed that 14 companies explicitly used the term CE in their TCFD 
disclosures to refer to their activities, including 6 Japanese companies, 2 US companies, 3 EU companies, and 3 other 
companies. However, there were also some companies that disclosed similar activities, such as alternative material 
and recyclability, in their TCFD reports even though they don't use the term CE, what they are promoting is actually 
CE. Therefore, the diffusion of the CE concept in the description of corporate sustainability strategy is still limited. 
Regarding the descriptions of CE, firstly, the provision of alternative materials (e.g., biomass raw materials) and 
recycling technologies related to plastics were mentioned as strategically important CE-related business opportunities 
in the chemical industry. Some companies explained this in relation to transition risks through changes in legislation 
and consumer trends, indicating that companies understood the impact of future social changes on the expansion of 
their CE business. Second, some companies are emphasizing CE within the group's business strategy. These 
companies do not limit their CE initiatives to sustainability activities, but is seen as a factor that will affect corporate 
performances and strategies in the medium to long term.

Abstract 
The growth of the gas station business in Indonesia is increasing from year to year. It requires companies in oil and 
gas industries to improve performance. Oil and gas company state-owned in Indonesia have 3 ownership schemes, 
namely COCO (Company Owned, Company Operated), CODO (Company Owned, Dealer Operated), and DODO 
(Dealer Owned, Dealer Operated). This study analyzes differences in the performance of the three schemes. The results 
can be used as company's strategic planning. Gas station performance measured by the efficiency of each gas station 
unit, also differences between the three schemes. Two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to calculate 
the efficiency of each gas station. In the first phase of DEA, measuring efficiency in the operational aspects of gas 
stations with the aim of maximizing sales and transaction numbers. In the second stage of DEA, it measures cost 
efficiency at gas stations, by minimizing the cost at gas stations. According to the findings of the study, DEA analysis 
of the two stages is that there is no significant difference, however COCO gas station has highest efficiency, followed 
by the CODO gas station, and in the last place the DODO gas station with the lowest average efficiency.

1. Introduction
The dynamic development and growth of the industrial world make every element in it to always be adaptive to make 
changes and sustainable improvements (Keh & Chu, 2003). This is in addition to increasing company profits, as well 
as maintaining consumer loyalty to ensure the company's existence during increasingly fierce competition. The 
dynamics of business competition also occur in the fuel oil (BBM) and natural gas industries.  The competition in the 
gas station company requires to take strategic steps to improve performance and infrastructure in the downstream 
sector (refining, marketing, and trade).  
PT. Pertamina is a BUMN (State Owned Enterprise) whose job is to manage oil and gas mining in Indonesia from 
upstream to downstream. Pertamina has three gas station ownership schemes, the first of which is DODO gas stations 
(Dealer Owned, Dealer Operated) where the gas station is fully owned by the private sector, including land, assets, 
and operational activities. The second type of ownership is CODO (Company Owned Dealer Operated) gas stations 
where the gas stations are owned by Pertamina, but operational activities are carried out by the private sector. 
Furthermore, the third type of gas station is COCO gas station (Company Owned Company Operated) (Pertamina 
2016). Until now, there is no standard measurement for performance of gas stations. Pertamina never knows how the 
performance of CODO, and DODO gas stations is, so it cannot be certain whether private gas stations are appropriate 
or not managing gas stations. Due to the importance of maintaining gas station performance, performance 
measurement is needed for each gas station. This performance can be seen from the efficiency figures of each gas 
station unit and the gas station ownership scheme. One of the efforts to improve the performance of gas stations is to 
look at the efficiency value of each gas station based on gas station ownership.

Figure 3. Efficiency Graph by Stage and Ownership 
 
At the operational stage, COCO gas stations have an average efficiency of 0.84, while CODO gas stations have an 
average efficiency of 0.81, and DODO gas stations are 0.68. At the cost efficiency stage, COCO gas stations have an 
average efficiency value of 0.86, followed by CODO gas stations with an average efficiency of 0.88, then in last place 
DODO gas stations have the lowest average efficiency with a value of 0.81. It can be concluded in the graph above 
that in Stage 1 COCO gas stations are superior, which means that COCO gas stations have the best efficiency in 
maximizing revenue. In the second stage, CODO gas stations are purple with an efficiency value of 0.88, which means 
that CODO gas stations have the best performance in cost efficiency. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Graph of Efficiency Value 1 based on stage and Ownership 
 
In stage 1 (Figure 4), there are a total of 8 gas stations with an efficiency value of 1, including 4 COCO gas stations, 
2 CODO gas stations, and 2 DODO gas stations. In stage 2, there are a total of 13 gas stations with an efficiency value 
of 1, including 6 COCO gas stations, 5 CODO gas stations, and 2 DODO gas stations. In stage 2 COCO gas stations 
also excel in the most efficiency values. From Table 2 and Table 3 COCO gas stations excel in operational efficiency 
performance, and CODO gas stations excel in cost efficiency. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The Data Envelopment Analysis method is useful for determining the performance of units within a company, by 
using the efficiency value of each DMU. Gas station performance is important for the sustainability of the company, 
especially where the company has various gas station ownership schemes. According to research, COCO (Corporate 
Owned Corporate Operated) gas stations have the highest efficiency of all aspects analyzed in this study with average 
efficiency value is 0,84. CODO gas stations (Corporate Owned Dealer Operated) have the highest efficiency value in 
terms of cost efficiency with efficiency value 0,88. The Last, DODO gas stations (Dealer Owned Dealer Operated) 
have the lowest efficiency in the two stages of DEA.

Abstract 
The optimum and correct location of warehouse in order to minimise the inbound and outbound logistic cost of the 
company/firm plays a crucial role in these challenging and costly environment. As of now very tedious and time 
consuming techniques are there to solve and locate it. This work covers the strategy to select the best geographical 
location within the targeted range, this work can also be successfully utilised in customer-warehouse model , 
warehouse-manufacturing unit model and manufacturing unit-supplier model by minimizing inbound , outbound 
logistics cost and the transporting raw material cost. The model is prepared with KMeans algorithm, unsupervised 
machine learning and shape file is used for the visual representation of results on GIS map of the selected region. 
KMeans is very powerful algorithm in deciding the initial clustering of customers based on geographical location. The 
model clusters the location by calculating the Euclidean distance and grouping them based on the minimum distance 
criteria. Latitude and longitude, being on the coordinate reference system, a spherical one, haversine formula is used 
for the distance calculation in the KMeans logic development. This work presents the clustering model that incorporate 
longitude, latitude and shape file of the geographical region as an input. Steps: Randomly initialize centroids, from 
each data point calculate haversine distance, group them based on minimum distance, update the centroid by using 
mean of all the points , check for the centroids again, if not changed otherwise go to step . For the experiment, India 
map is the system of consideration, with the top 20 major cities and the cleaned geographical data of cities and shape 
file of the Indian boundaries are given as input to the K Means algorithm, resulting in the three optimum location at 
(Lat1, Long1), (Lat2, Long2), (Lat3,Long3) and group the cities into respective clusters. The major and only input is 
the GIS Coordinate i.e. latitude and longitude for the machine learning model and with the minimal input, this work 
gives the ability/flexibility to get the basic structure of the supply chain element i.e. supplier, manufacturing, 
warehouse and customer location. Later on based on the other parameters the results can be refined in order to consider 
the type of the product, population of the cities etc.  In case of new product introduction or the extension of the already 
existing region, the outcome from this model might be a boon for the investment decision in the construction of new 
facility. it will help for decision making by not only giving the location but also the optimum number of location.

Abstract 
Construction project within construction industry is deemed as high process industry through its perspectives of 
reliability and quality. Therefore, misconduct of the execution in this industry plays vital role of generating wide array 
of accidents and diseases.  On empirical perspectives and on Indonesia’s Construction project the risk intertwines 
wide spectrum of activities and processes. To some extent, it requires improvement and decision-making strategy. 
Subsequently, on theoretical perspectives, the risk mitigations in construction industry have been implemented. To 
begin with, failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is deemed conventional method in proceeding vis-à-vis 
construction industry. Furthermore, FMEA is followed by other methods, e.g., FTA, known as fault tree analysis; 
ETA, identified as event tree analysis. Ultimately, there are HAZOP study, as refer to hazard and operability study, 
and root cause analysis. The objective of this paper is to harness the theoretical and empirical perspectives of FMEA 
through the lens of improvement and decision-making strategy, within Indonesia’s construction project. In term of 
improvement strategy, FMEA contributes not only to improvement strategy but also in failure risk reprioritization 
within FMEA methodology. Precisely, this FMEA methodology, is using index of risk priority number, namely RPN, 
through trilogy of detection ability (D), occurrence (O), and severity (S). In term of decision-making strategy, FMEA 
contributes to lean and sustainability concept, to some options of reducing waste with goal of augmenting productivity 
and enhancing customer’s value proposition. This paper refers to the FMEA’s improvement and decision-making 
strategy in both theoretical and empirical perspectives within Indonesia’s construction project and its relevant research 
methodology. Ultimately, this paper elaborates integrated FMEA within bibliometric analysis as the result of Venn 
Diagram’s Intersection among functional FMEA, process FMEA and design FMEA.

This paper elaborates the fact that FMEA and its improvement strategy is beneficial not only for product and 
manufacturing, but also vis-à-vis service industry. This paper emphasizes this benefit for application in Indonesia’ 
construction projects within construction industry. FMEA and its decision-making strategy is beneficial for decision-
making strategy not merely on the prior discussion of economic and RPN criteria; but also, the one of choosing not 
only RPN, but also the available FMEA methods, e.g., Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), or, Event Tree Analysis (ETA), or 
Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study, and root cause analysis. 
 
The choice of RPN and the data as results of RPNs as depicted in Table 3, 4, 5 and 6 in this paper, determines the 
decision-making of Indonesia’s construction project in this paper. 
It is deemed important to highlight that the empirical perspectives of Indonesia’s construction project in this paper 
intertwines with the lean construction and sustainability. Thus, empirically, this paper of Indonesia’s construction 
project, elaborates the decision-making strategy that enable stakeholders, for the following positions and beyond e.g., 
managers and practitioners to select the appropriate lean construction projects for implementation.

Abstract 
The aim of this project is to give a practical demonstration of the most recent and revolutionary methods used at a 
professional level for the structure and design phases of developing a new car. Therefore, we need to clarify the steps 
that go from the birth of a new idea to its transformation into a virtual product. The result of the project is the design 
of a cutting-edge car that encompasses the technical, stylistic, and social needs of a potential user in the near future. 
A further purpose of the path was to demonstrate the main innovative technologies available, to date, in support of the 
design, which allows us to define the product at an extremely reduced time and cost. Subsequently, allowing feedback 
from the market in the first few stages of development and implementing a maximally customer-oriented design. In 
this project, for the first time, virtual reality has been combined with the classic 3D modeling methodologies. This 
allowed to have immediate feedback on the product without having to wait for the completion of the 3D screen 
modeling on a 2D screen. It is therefore a new criterion that allows for fast and reliable response, thanks to the clearer 
display given by virtual reality. We are therefore talking about a new design that, iteratively, allows you to test the 
product, modify it and improve it quickly and without wasting materials.

1. Introduction
This project was born to solve certain problems related to the creation phase of new products and in particular to three-
dimensional modeling. From the experience gained over time we have been able to ascertain that the three-dimensional 
representation of surfaces was a source of great loss of time and required very specific skills. This research started 
from this awareness, with the aim of identifying possible alternatives to traditional modeling and of giving a practical 
demonstration by applying them to the development of a new automobile. This research is important because it 
demonstrates the validity of a new technology, virtual reality, applied to three-dimensional modeling. In addition, the 
research provides information on what cars in 2030 will look like, what features they will have and what needs they 
will meet. This project can therefore be used as a guide for anyone wishing to study the development of a new product 
with a cutting-edge, innovative, and effective technology. The outcome of this process was a well-defined virtual 
product resulting from the use of a structured methodology for the development of new products (IDeS methodology) 
and the supporting design software (Creo Parametric, Autocad 2D, Alias Studio, Gravity Sketch, Rhino3D, Keyshot, 
Photoshop). By going through the various phases of the IDeS (Industrial Design Structure) method in succession, the 
various options currently available on the market were identified and compared in order to focus on the most successful 
products and on the needs of the market. The goal of IDeS applied to this project was to develop a car as close to the 
""ideal"" car, i.e. the one defined by the Top-Flop analysis. In particular, the present study represented a further step 
forward of the IDeS method since it validated its efficiency in relation to a future-oriented project. Precisely, the 
design methods of which the IDeS is composed have been partially revisited in line with the time horizon of the 
project. Therefore, all phases of comparison with the current market are actually the result of a projection into the 
future of the car models currently available. In this way the project represents the validation of the robustness of the 
IDeS method not only for applications for products of different nature, but also related to different time perspectives.

Thanks to the realism offered by virtual reality, we were able to test the model directly inside this ambient (Figure 8). 
In addition to that, we 3D-printed the model (Figure 9) and realized some rendering using Keyshot software (Figure 
10).

6. Conclusion 
The development project for the 2030 car was the result of a structured and systematic process, the one indicated by 
the IDeS methodology, which allowed us, in about 8 months, to understand the car of the future, what characteristics 
it should have, what needs it satisfy and to generate a well-defined virtual model. The ""Auto 2030"" program, in 
addition to representing a further validation of the IDeS methodology, demonstrates how to apply the most modern 
technologies available to design support to arrive at a digital product in a very short time and at low cost. In particular, 
the implementation of augmented reality as a project system is a new and outstanding method which has made it 
possible to combine the classic 3D modeling with a virtual three-dimensional space thanks to which, directly in the 
design phase, some corrections have been made directly under construction. This made it possible to have immediate 
feedback on the product without having to wait for the completion of the 3D modeling on the classic flat screen. It is 
therefore a new criterion that allows for fast and reliable feedback thanks to the clearer feedback given by virtual

reality. We are therefore talking about a new design which, iteratively, allows the product to be tested, modified, and 
improved quickly and without wasting material. The result is a fully electric urban SUV capable of meeting future 
urban and extra-urban mobility needs, thanks to the union of the various and innumerable technical and qualitative 
requirements that have been condensed inside.

at PTS in the scope of LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi and Gorontalo. Seen from direct influence path analysis shows the 
learning environment has a positive and significant influence on learning motivation. In addition, some respondents 
said that families are very supportive of the achievement of their learning achievements. This means that when the 
learning environment is good, the learning motivation is also good. When the learning environment is not good, the 
learning motivation will also decrease. 
The Effect of Bidikmisi Scholarship on Student Learning Achievement of PTS in the scope LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi 
and Gorontalo; Bidikmisi scholarships directly impact the learning achievement of PTS students in the scope of 
LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi and Gorontalo. Seen from the analysis of natural influence pathways showed that the mission 
objectives had a positive and significant effect on learning achievement. This means that if a scholarship is awarded, 
then the learning achievement will increase and when the scholarship is not granted, the learning achievement will 
decrease. 
The Influence of Learning Environment on Student Learning Achievement of PTS in the scope LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi 
and Gorontalo; The learning environment has a positive influence directly on the learning achievements of PTS 
students in the scope of LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi and Gorontalo. Seen from direct influence path analysis shows the 
learning environment is positive and has significant value to learning achievement. This means that when the place or 
area of learning is good, the learning achievement will increase and when the learning environment is not good, the 
learning achievement will decrease. 
The Influence of Learning Motivation on Student Learning Achievement of PTS in the scope LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi 
and Gorontalo; Learning motivation has a positive influence directly on the learning achievements of PTS students in 
the scope LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi and Gorontalo. Seen from direct influence path analysis shows that learning 
motivation has a positive and significant effect on learning achievement. This means that when the motivation of 
learning increases, the learning achievement will increase and when the learning motivation decreases, then the 
learning achievement will decrease. 
The Effect of Bidikmisi Scholarship on Learning Achievement through Learning Motivation of PTS in the scope 
LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi and Gorontalo; Bidikmisi scholarships have a significant impact on improving learning 
achievement through the motivation of PTS students in the scope of LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi and Gorontalo. Seen from 
the results of the Sobel test, which shows the scholarship of Bidikmisi has a positive and significant effect on learning 
achievement through learning motivation. This means that when a scholarship is awarded, the learning achievement 
will increase and when mediated by motivation, the learning achievement will be further improved. 
The Influence of The Learning Environment on Learning Achievement through Learning Motivation of PTS in the 
scope LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi and Gorontalo; The learning environment positively influences learning achievements 
through the motivation of PTS students in the scope LLDIKTI IX Sulawesi and Gorontalo. The Sobel test results show 
that the learning environment provides benefits relevant to learning achievements through learning motivation. It 
means that when the learning environment is good, the learning achievement will increase and when mediated by 
learning motivation, the learning achievement will be increased. 
6. Conclusions
Based on the results, it can be concluded that the scholarship and learning environment can generate learning 
motivation for students and ultimately can excel. If scholarships are given and supported by a good learning 
environment, the higher the motivation of students' learning so that learning achievements will also increase. Thus, 
all the results of the study are in line with the proposed hypothesis. If the motivation of learning increases, then the 
learning achievement also increases and vice versa. If the motivation of learning decreases, then the learning 
achievement also decreases, meaning that the fulfilment of the needs of students on the scholarship and the learning 
environment will be more motivated to excel.

Human resources (HR) are the most critical assets in the company because their roles and functions are the subjects 
that operate the company's policies, programs, and activities. Other essential resources owned by a company include 
capital, methods, management, and machines. These resources will not run optimally if they are not supported by 
human resources who have good performance. Reveals that training and development are always carried out by 
recruits or workers, both new and old, to improve employee performance (Anwar 2021; Arfan 2021).

if the variable influence of the training program on Self-Efficacy is positive and significant with an influence value of 
0.426. Meaning it can be understood that the training will be accompanied by increased self-efficacy. While assuming 
other factors that affect the magnitude or smallness of training, it is constant. The positive and significant influence of 
training variables on employee self-efficacy variables in the regional secretariat of Bantaeng Regency can be known 
from the results of line analysis that directly affect self-efficacy. 
 
The Influence of Motivation on Self-Efficacy; The impact of motivational variables on self-efficacy is positively 
marked. It has a significant influence value of 0.172 in the sense of increased motivation followed by the development 
of self-efficacy, assuming other factors that affect large and small motivations are constant. The positive and 
significant influence of motivation on employees' self-efficacy in the Regional Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency is 
known through the analysis of the direct influence of work motivation that gives a positive and significant influence 
on self-efficacy. 
 
The Effect of Self-Efficacy on Job Satisfaction; The effect of self-efficacy variables on employee job satisfaction was 
positive and significant, with an influence value of 0.206. It states that increased employee self-efficacy followed by 
increased job satisfaction is assumed if other factors that affect the magnitude and smallness of self-efficacy apply to 
content. The positive and significant influence of self-efficacy on employee job satisfaction is known according to the 
analysis of direct self-efficacy pathways that have a positive impact and are significant to job satisfaction. 
 
The Effect of Job Satisfaction Training Through Self-Efficacy; The variable influence of training on job satisfaction 
through Employee Self-Efficacy is positive and significant, with an influence value of 0.420. In the sense that an 
increase follows the improvement of Job Satisfaction Through Self-Efficacy in the level of influence of training 
programs if other factors that affect the size or smallness of training and self-efficacy are constant. The positive and 
significant influence of training through self-efficacy on employee job satisfaction at the regional secretariat of 
Bantaeng Regency is known following the results of the analysis of the pathway on the direct influence of training 
through self-efficacy that has a positive and significant influence on job satisfaction. 
 
The Influence of Motivation on Job Satisfaction Through Self-Efficacy; The influence of motivation variables on job 
satisfaction through self-efficacy is positive and significant, and the value of influence is 0.117. Meaning that the 
increase in motivation will be followed by self-efficacy, which also impacts improving job satisfaction is assumed if 
other factors affect the magnitude or smallness of motivation and self-efficacy is expressed to be constant. The positive 
and significant influence of work motivation on job satisfaction through the efficacy of employees in the regional 
secretariat of Bantaeng Regency is known following the results of the analysis of direct motivational influence 
pathways. It has a positive and significant effect on job satisfaction through variable intervening self-efficacy. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Based on the research results and the discussion in the research on ""The Influence of Training and Motivation on Job 
Satisfaction Through Self-Efficacy of Employees in the Secretariat of Bantaeng Regency. It can be concluded that 
training programs and motivation towards employees is an important thing to improve one's self-efficacy in carrying 
out the tasks and responsibilities given by the organization. In other words, improving employee training and 
motivation will make employees more confident to solve various problems faced at work.

Compensation, Discipline, Performance and Work Motivation of Employees 
1. Introduction
The effect is not personal traits, such as talents or abilities, but expressions of talent or skills themselves. Performance 
is an expression of competence in the context of actual work. Implementing the work that employees have achieved 
in the development of work and activities comes from the organization. 
Performance means the results achieved by an individual or group of people in an organization according to their 
respective management and responsibilities. To achieve established legal objectives, unregulated and following the 
employee's code of conduct and conduct, general practices or inaction that affects most of its contributions to the 
office or organization, including service quality conditions, suggest that applying the value of various employee 
behaviors contributes, both positively and negatively, to goal-defining organizations. Another view of implementation 
is ensuring that every employee or team knows what is needed and continues to focus on functional performance by 
monitoring goals, practices, and evaluations (Sultoni et al. 2018; Nath et al. 2021; Suharyanto et al. 2021; Lionardo et 
al. 2020).

The results of the sixth hypothesis test show that compensation has a positive and significant effect on performance 
through employee work motivation. This is demonstrated by the more appropriate balance given. The employee's 
work motivation will also increase so that the performance of employees in the Secretariat of the Soppeng Regency 
Parliament will also be improved. 
This research is relevant to the results (Gunawan and Sunardi 2016; Aromega et al.; 2019,  Mahardika et al. 2021), 
with the title of research on the Influence of Work Discipline, Compensation and Discipline on Employee Performance 
of Permata Bank Makassar Employees. The results of this study are the influence of compensation results of this study 
showed that the organizational culture, leadership, and Work Motivation had a positive and significant effect on 
improving the performance of employees in the Secretariat of the DPRD Central Java Province. 
The policy of compensation, both the size, arrangement, and timing of payment, can encourage the passion of work 
and the desire of employees to achieve optimal work performance to help the realization of the company's goals. The 
work size, official position, external consistency is guided by justice and labor law. With this policy, it is expected 
that harmonious cooperation will be built and provide satisfaction to all parties. 
5.7 The Effect of Discipline on Employee Performance Through Work Motivation  
The results of the seventh hypothesis test show that discipline has a positive and significant effect on performance 
through employee work motivation. This is displayed if the high level of discipline, then employee work motivation 
will also increase so that the performance of employees in the Secretariat of the DPRD Soppeng will also be improved. 
6. Conclusions

Regency and vice versa.
2. If the discipline is high, then the employee will be motivated, and otherwise, the lower the level of discipline, the
employee will also be encouraged.
3. If employee compensation is reasonable and following expectations, it will improve performance. Otherwise, the
more unnatural than, the lower the employee will also be.
4. If the level of discipline is high, then the employee's actions will increase and, on the contrary, the lower the level
of discipline, the lower the employee will also be.
5. If high incentive work increases the number of active workers and vice versa, the lower the work incentive, the
less productive the employee will be.
6. If the remuneration is appropriate, then the incentive of employees who will also hire employees in the Secretariat
of DPRD Soppeng Regency will be raised.

1. Introduction
The State Civil Apparatus (ASN) is one of the driving assets in the government environment, with the State Civil 
Apparatus (ASN) being the driving force of the central government to the regions down to the lowest level. In various 
fields and especially organizational life, the human factor is the main problem in every activity. An organization is a 
consciously coordinated social unit with an identifiable reactive boundary, working continuously to achieve goals. 
Government organizations require potential human resources, both leaders and employees, in the pattern of tasks and 
supervision, which are the determinants of achieving organizational goals. 
Employees who work significantly affect the performance of an agency, this is because employees are the main driver 
for every operational activity and play an active role in achieving or not achieving an agency goal. The states that 
performance is generally divided into two: individual performance and organizational performance. Individual 
performance results from employee work both in terms of quality and quantity based on specified work standards, 
while organizational performance is a combination of individual performance and group performance (Purnamasari, 
2021). In other words, employee performance is directly proportional to the organization's performance in which the 
employee carries out his duties and responsibilities. Performance is a system used to assess and find out whether an 
employee has carried out his work as a whole or is a combination of work results (what one must achieve) and 
competence (how one achieves it). Meanwhile, according to Ansori & Ali (2017)stated that performance is basically 
what employees do or do not do in carrying out their work. According to Komara & Nelliawati (2014), individual

The essence of education is related to students' potential to become human believers and fear of Allah, noble, healthy, 
knowledgeable, occupied, creative, self-sufficient, and become a democratic community and responsible. The essence 
of education is sourced on religious norms, Indonesian national culture and always follows the times. National 
education in Indonesia is still faced with some significant problems, as the opportunity to obtain an education is still

5. Discussion
The influence of infrastructure management on the quality of learning at KKM MAN 1 Bulukumba, which consists 
of 5 Madrasah Aliyah seen from the direct influence path analysis, shows a positive and significant impression of 
learning infrastructure management. The positive and significant influence of infrastructure management on the 
quality of learning indicates that the better the management of infrastructure facilities in the madrasa environment at 
KKM MAN 1 Bulukumba, the better the quality of learning in the madrasa the auspices of KKM MAN 1 Bulukumba. 
The influence of facilities and infrastructure management on student learning outcomes is positive and significant, 
meaning that increasing student learning outcomes will follow improvements in infrastructure management by 
assuming other influencing factors are considered constant. The positive and significant influence of infrastructure 
management on student learning outcomes at KKM MAN 1 Bulukumba is seen from the direct influence path analysis 
results, which shows infrastructure management positively and significantly on student learning outcomes. 
Quality of Learning shows a positive and significant effect on learning outcomes, meaning that improvements in 
learning quality will be accompanied by student learning outcomes, assuming that other factors are considered 
constant. The positive and significant influence of the quality of learning on students' learning outcomes at KKM 
MAN 1 Bulukumba can be seen from the direct influence path analysis results, which shows a positive and significant 
influence on the learning quality variable on students' learning outcomes. The positive and significant influence of 
learning outcomes on student learning outcomes indicates that the better the quality of learning, the higher the students' 
learning outcomes at KKM MAN 1 Bulukumba. Conversely, if the quality of learning is not good, then student 
learning outcomes will decrease. 
The influence of infrastructure management on learning outcomes through the quality of learning is positive and 
significant, meaning that improving infrastructure management in madrasas will be followed by an increase in student 
learning outcomes through the quality of learning, assuming that other influencing factors are considered constant. 
Management of facilities and infrastructure can, directly and indirectly, support the smooth learning process. A good 
learning process can improve the quality of learning and student learning outcomes. Students with good learning 
outcomes have cognitive domains (knowledge, understanding, application, analysis, synthesis, assessment). They are 
affective domains (attention to lessons, discipline, learning motivation, respect for teachers and classmates, study 
habits, and social relationships.) and psychomotor domain (skills in unconscious movements, skills in conscious 
movements, perceptual abilities, and abilities related to communication). 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded as follows: Management of facilities and infrastructure has a 
positive and significant effect on the quality of learning; Management of facilities and infrastructure has a positive 
and significant effect on learning outcomes; The quality of learning has a positive and significant effect on learning 
outcomes; Management of facilities and infrastructure has a positive and significant effect on learning outcomes 
through the quality of learning.

1. Introduction
Education is one of the most important things that many people must consider producing potential human resources 
both for now and in the future. Communication as a fundamental human activity, through communication, can be 
connected both in everyday life in the community or in organizations (Liliweri, 2015). 
Intrapersonal communication is so influenced by the self-concept of human behavior, about what it looks like to see 
itself and others see and can influence interactions on others. The form of interpersonal communication has an impact

smoothly. In addition, teamwork has helped employees understand their respective roles and responsibilities in the 
ongoing teamwork. 
Supported by previous research (Kusumawardhani & Prabawani, 2017; Lindawati, 2014; Sunengsih, 2014; Syahrir et 
al., 2019a). With interpersonal communication, employees become the primary tool for perfecting organizational 
relationships. Interpersonal communication is carried out effectively to provide organizational benefits, and the 
atmosphere and the work environment become more conducive. Is supported by previous research conducted by 
(Haeruddin & Tamsah, 2016; Maddatuang, 2018; Munir et al., 2020; Ridewan et al., 2017). Improving the quality of 
work reporting that provides accuracy and accuracy of reports given to the leadership. As well as other roles showed 
that the best performance of employees in the organization requires a lot of involvement of employees who understand 
each other; one employee does not have to be superior to the other. 
Supported by previous research by (Dira et al., 2020; Marpaung, 2014; Pandelaki, 2018; Sarboini et al., 2017). 
Employees maintain a solid team, and service is a great asset of the organization because it will be easier to get targets 
in a planned manner with faster and better work results. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results and discussion, it can be concluded that interpersonal communication can positively and 
significantly affect employee performance directly and indirectly through work teams and organizational 
commitments for Performance of the Education and Culture of Bantaeng Regency. In this research, organizational 
commitment is the variable that most influences employee performance with a high sense of employee ownership of 
the organization; employees place themselves higher in the organization formally, and employees who like the 
organization to strive to achieve the goals desired by their organization. Meanwhile, the work team as the variable 
with the lowest effect on performance is indicated by the lack of optimal employee responsibilities in building a solid 
team.

Abstract 
Considering the volume of information technology (IT) project management failures occurring in businesses that strive 
to become fully digitalized, the present paper uses diagnosis and prescriptive analyses to propose effective digital 
solutions using qualitative secondary data from published research. Results indicate that successful technology project 
management (TPM) should consider highly qualified TPM professionals, skills, milestones, processes and budgeting 
in addition to observing standard project management methodologies tailored to the core business activities. The 
integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in information technology projects has proven to reduce project challenges 
while optimizing management of project scope, time, cost and resources besides big data management, automation, 
quality control, risk awareness and project productivity increase. Results revealed that digital-orientated companies 
have been allocating 46%, 46%, 52% and 39% of their budget to cover potential needs regarding digital upgrading on 
cloud computing, data security, ERP systems and project management. Furthermore, the key AI requirements for 
effective IT project deployment reside in apportioning 74%, 73%, 71% and 68% of the staff to security operations, 
Analytics platforms, Business workflow automation and cloud platforms respectively. However, the executors, the 
executors’ project implementation phases comprising analysis, design, test, setup, deployment, training and support 
should be aligned with the receptors’ project stages that include As-is process analysis, documented process, To-Be 
processes, process modelling, legacy system readiness, training and system support to guarantee a conclusive IT 
project deployment.

1. Introduction
The Fourth Industrial Revolution has revolutionized all sectors of business and operations management in tech 
industries including project management. IT projects include software implementation, database management, 
technological installation, web development, network configuration, IT system recovery and mobile app development 
among others. According to the report published by the Project Management Institute (2017), the market need for 
project talent has considerably evolved in the last decade with companies and organisations seeking project-orientated 
roles and positions. Technology project management (TPM) focuses on achieving a specific requirement for business 
evolvement using predefined techniques, budget, resources, skills and time compared to traditional project 
management operations. Considering that companies and organisations constantly struggle with IT projects due to 
their expensiveness, expansiveness, longer commitments, several stakeholders and intense market competition 
(Deloitte, 2022), improving return on investment on technology projects has become the main priority of businesses. 
It can only be guaranteed if project outcomes are well defined, a strong project team is assembled with a support 
system and most importantly when the project plan itself is reasonable and adapted to the core business activities 
(Deloitte, 2022).  
Based on the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence can enable business performance through data analysis, 
streamlining workflows, data predictions, automated processes and time-savings (Ntaskmanager, 2022). Most 
worldwide companies apply artificial intelligence in the IT sector to detect security intrusions, complex technological 
problems and internal compliance compared to other fields like finance, marketing and customer services

5. Conclusion
Upgrading to digital innovations requires specific components to be put in place to ensure market positioning and 
competitive edge assurance. In doing so, several IT projects should be deployed to achieve customer expectations and 
satisfaction through software development, business reengineering, cloud computing, cybersecurity and continuous 
web development using artificial intelligence for efficiency enhancement. Challenges associated with technology 
project management are considerably reduced once the technology of artificial intelligence is deployed together with 
project techniques and methodologies. Additionally, opportunities for staffing requirements improve offering 
employment at a large scale.

Abstract 
This research describes the possibility of handling complex geometries through Rhinoceros, three-dimensional 
modeling software, by means of some parameterization blocks. More specifically, by processing programming codes 
in an internal Rhinoceros environment (Grasshopper), it is possible to parameterize geometries, allowing accurate and 
dynamic modeling. The geometry analyzed in the following discussion is an unconventional closed-cell structure. It 
is based on the application of Voronoi diagrams in the three-dimensional field, thus creating closed cells in a foam-
like manner. The objective pursued is to further study the properties of such structures and possible applications, 
ranging from the automotive to the biomedical field. The possibility of modeling complex structures with easiness, 
combined with the possibility of realizing them through modern additive manufacturing techniques, leads to the 
development of new, unconventional materials with unique mechanical properties and fully customizable behavior.

1. Introduction
1.1 Rhinoceros and Grasshopper
Rhinoceros is a commercial software for 3D modeling so called freeform surfaces. The modeling process is done
through NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), an opposite approach to polygon meshes applied by other
competing software (Gou & Zhu, 2022; Grillanda et al., 2022; Herrema et al., 2017). It is known for its diversity,
multidisciplinary functionality, low learning curve, relatively low cost and the ability to export files in different
formats, making it also a true conversion tool within a workflow. The software has numerous plug-ins, which allow
many different functionalities and increase the potential of the basic software. In general components made with
Rhinoceros are used in structural and energy optimizations, but also in the naval industry thanks to the possibility to
realize complex shapes, which do not follow classical geometric primitives (Keskas et al., 2022; Willis, 2016; Wu et
al., 2022). The Rhinoceros plug-in used is Grasshopper: it is a block programming environment (high level) that makes
Rhinoceros parametric. Grasshopper allows complex 3D shapes to be generated by defining a node diagram
(algorithm) that can describe the mathematical and geometric relationships present within a model. Three-dimensional
models developed in this context are dynamic systems that can be modified in real time by varying the parameters
defined during the construction of block diagrams, with immediate advantages in controlling geometries (Hsu et al.,
2015).
1.2 Voronoi structure 
The Voronoi diagram is named after Georges Voronoi and is also called Voronoi tessellation, or Dirichlet tessellation 
(from Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet)(Dirichlet, 1889; Voronoi, 1908). The mathematical definition of a Voronoi 
diagram is basically a subdivision of a plane into zones close to a given set of objects. In the simplest case, considering 
a plane and thus only two dimensions, these objects are a finite number of points in the plane and are called seeds. For 
each point, a corresponding region, called the Voronoi cell, is determined; this consists of all points in the plane closer 
to that specific seed than to any other. The process is carried out for each seed. Voronoi diagrams have both practical 
and theoretical applications in many fields, especially in science and technology (Cheng et al., 2022; Frizziero et al., 
2021; Pan et al., 2020).

The time required to print a cube of size 100x100x100 is 8 hours. This can be further reduced by optimizing the 
starting geometry and the nozzle path itself defined within the slicer. On larger prints or with a view to faster printing 
of this type of polymer, it would also be possible to optimize the starting geometry in order to be able to use larger 
nozzle sizes. These allow a considerable reduction in the printing time required at the cost of a typically lower surface 
finish. Also given the larger nozzle diameter, there would be less back pressure reducing buckling in the filament and 
being able to increase the printing speed itself as well. The printing temperature would then be raised to accommodate 
the higher volumetric flow rate, needing to heat a larger volume of filament inside the nozzle and extruding it in a 
shorter time. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Through the use of Rhinoceros and Grasshopper, it was possible to create a parametric workflow for the realization 
of closed-cells Voronoi like structure. The dimension and density of the cells can be adjusted in real time, without the 
need of a complete redrawing of the geometry. Thanks to FDM 3D printing process capability and the possibility of 
processing polymers such as TPU, it was possible to make a first foam like cube with this type of structure. The choice 
of printing parameters is vital to reduce the creation of artifacts on the printed geometry or under extrusion 
zones/extruder failure due to filament buckling. The combination of the presented geometry combined with the 
appropriate choice of settings gives us a stable result and good starting point for future development.  
 
The next step is to improve both the obtained Voronoi geometry, improving its printability, and the realization of the 
geometry itself, optimizing the Grasshopper programming flow to allow Rhinoceros to process these structures even 
on larger array scales.  
 
It may be of interest once the Grasshopper workflow has been optimized, to integrate the cell fabrication process with 
a density-based optimization process (continuously variable density) that changes the Voronoi cell density based on, 
for example, a stress or strain field. In this way, the density can be increased where needed, leading to foams optimized 
for the specific application or purpose. 
 
Of course, accurate mechanical tests need to be conducted to evaluate the compressive stress-strain behavior of these 
types of structures, including evaluating the effect of density variation on mechanical properties. Having done that, it 
would be possible to make Ashby-Gibson curves in which to plot, for example, the reduced Young's modulus versus 
the reduced density, so as to get a better view of the behavior of these foams. Because of the anisotropy introduced 
during the layer-by-layer printing, it would be necessary to do compression tests not only along the Z direction of 
printing, but also in the XY plane.  
 
This type of testing would require a very large number of samples, resulting in wasted material, time and high costs. 
The solution to this problem is the possibility to accurately predict the behavior at different density and different 
compression plane using FEA (Finite Element Analisys) simulation performed on specific software. The simplest 
method to simulate these porous materials is to create a nonlinear RVE and then validate it at some specific points on 
the Ashby-Gibson curve (defined reduced density values). This would greatly reduce the number of tests to be 
performed, but would ensure that the behavior of these foams can be predicted at any density value.

The realization of this FE (Finite Element) model is quite simple and many FE software have a dedicated integrated 
package. A further simplification occurs if the mesh is structured, that is, given a cube of material, there is symmetry 
of the nodes on the opposite faces. The simplest way to achieve this is to use a symmetrical starting geometry for the 
cube, like the one we made in this study.  
Possible applications of this type of structure range from use as shock absorbers, for example in mountain bike guards 
or within the structure of helmets. In this case, the RVE model would be followed by a study through explicit FE 
simulations to validate the behavior of the Voronoi structure and material during impact and collapse of the cells 
themselves. Or intended for use as custom foams in the automotive industry to create custom seats or special 
motorcycle seats to improve comfort or create prototypes. All the way to the biomedical sector, where they could be 
used, for example, to produce orthopedic insoles customized to individual patient specifications.

Abstract 
Efforts at modernising seaports and improve their operational service efficiencies for competitive advantage have 
remained unabated given the changing demands of shipping customers. To address seaport inefficiencies, most 
advance nations have generally adopted infrastructural and technological upgrades/ implementations. However, this 
approach has failed to solve the lingering poor seaport performance in emerging economies, suggesting efforts must 
be directed at other areas to identify and explain the persistent inefficiencies at emerging economies’ seaports.  This 
paper therefore examine whether there is a relationship between seaport inefficiency and HRM practices of at a given 
seaports. The study is based on a case study of the Nigerian seaport, Nigeria being the largest economy in Africa. 
Findings reveal that HRM practices have to be fully aligned with seaport business objectives for achieving optimal 
port competitiveness. Specifically, the Nigerian seaports’ HRM Practices exhibits non-alignment with the business 
objectives due to unfair staff recruitment and promotion practices leading to poor staff morale, loyalty, commitment 
and productivity, resulting in significant business diversion to neighbouring seaports. 
Keywords 
Human Resources Management (HRM) Practices, Workforce capability, Seaport, Competitiveness. 
1. Introduction
There have been many challenges facing the users and operators of Nigerian seaports over the years. These include 
corruption, poor management structure and mismanagement (Emeghara et al 2019); logistics and infrastructure 
deficiencies, regulatory and policy instability and multiple government agencies with overlapping purpose and 
responsibilities (Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) 2018). These have resulted in the seaports’ 
inefficiency manifesting in the form of congestion, shortage of qualified manpower, missing cargo, prolong cargo 
dwell time caused by delay in cargo movement insecurity and illegal charges at the seaports; leading to high cost of 
operations (LCCI 2018). These have led to high cost of trade and undesirable impacts on the competitiveness of the 
seaports (Oruwari 2021), with significant effects on patronage, as cargo meant for Nigerian market are now being 
diverted to neighbouring seaports (Hellenic Shipping News 2020). Given the importance of seaports to the national 
economy and global competition between seaports for patronage, it is very important to identify and address the factors 
impacting seaport competitiveness (SC). 
Despite the high importance of the seaport to the economy and several efforts at modernising the seaport at various 
times by the Nigeria government, Nigerian seaports remain inefficient and struggle to cope with the country’s volume 
of export and imports. Many studies have been conducted to find the root cause of the inefficiency and many solution 
have been recommended based on findings. However, the proffered solutions have failed to solve the lingering poor 
performance of the seaports. This suggest that apart from the challenges associated with poor infrastructure and 
administrative structure, efforts must be directed at other areas to identify and explain the persistent inefficiencies at 
seaports that have defied many solutions. Without proper identification of the key underlying issues, no meaningful 
and/or effective solutions can be found. This study therefore focus on examining whether there is a relationship 
between seaport inefficiency and human resources management practices of the seaports.

For P2 there is also an association between WC and SC because practices status for both are weak. This shows that if 
there is good workforce capability building practices, it is expected that the seaport will be competitive and vice versa. 
This implies that a good workforce capability building will translate to competitiveness of the seaport. 
 
Table 5.  Propositions and Findings 
 
6. Conclusion  
There are two broad implications of this study These are theoretical and practical. Theoretically, there are two things 
it will contribute to literature. First is that investment in HR practices will have significant positive impact on 
workforce capability building in the context of a developing country. The second is that merit-based recruitment and 
promotion is very vital to improve workforce morale, loyalty, commitment and productivity in order to improve 
seaport competitiveness Practically, there are learnings the seaport managers to improve the competitiveness. They 
have to address issues with HR development. They must emphasize merit-based recruitment and promotion and also 
address issues with working condition of staff to improve productivity and provision of modern seaport technology. 
If the issues with HR development and practices are addressed, then this can be used as benchmarking for other African 
seaports to become competitive.

Abstract 
In the past decade, reported disasters are becoming more severe and the number of deaths also increases.  The impact 
of disaster could be reduced significantly with enough disaster preparedness.  Most recently, knowledge management 
has become a key part in disaster management specifically in the disaster preparedness phase. The aim of the study is 
to explore how individuals and the communities applied their knowledge in disaster preparedness. A survey method 
was utilized to measure their disaster preparedness before, during and after the Luzon, Philippines 7.0 magnitude 
earthquake last July 2022.  From the 46 randomly selected respondents that experienced the said earthquake, the results 
showed that the majority of the respondents have information about disaster preparedness.  Social media is the biggest 
source of disaster preparedness information. Roughly, 63% said they have attended training for disaster preparedness 
in an earthquake. Around 37% of the total respondents stated that they understand disaster risks and disaster-prone 
locations. Roughly, 30% said they knew the evacuation routes and evacuation procedures in which they lived. During 
the earthquake, the majority of the respondents were inside a building where they work. Around 96.6% of the 
respondents took cover under the table to protect them from the earthquake. After the earthquake, the majority of the 
respondents seek a safe place. It is recommended to have an improved disaster preparedness design to increase 
participation in disaster preparedness activities.

1. Introduction
The impact of disaster could be reduced significantly with disaster preparedness.  Disaster more recently has become 
more severe and the number of deaths increases thus, affecting more people and disrupting their way of life. Nations 
around the world faces significant challenges in terms of its vulnerability to natural disasters.  This vulnerability needs 
effective disaster management to lessen the impacts and ensure correct responses efficiently (Pathirage, Seneviratne, 
Amaratunga, & Haigh, 2012). Knowledge management is about acquiring the right knowledge appropriately.  The 
purpose of knowledge management is to facilitate the process of creating, sharing and using the knowledge.  Natural 
disasters could not be avoided but its impact could be neutralized, thus efforts must be exercise to mitigate its effect. 
Knowledge disaster management strategies could increase informed mitigation and develop more effective 
preparedness planning. Lessons learned in training and simulation in disaster should be apply in actual situations 
(Oktari, et al 2020).  Disaster management practitioners should consistently improve their knowledge and skills, these 
could be achieved through investments in systems, network structures and databases to have a culture of learning from 
past experiences.  Likewise, the current best practices utilized in disaster should be reviewed (Kusumastuti, et al. 
2021) and constantly updated to adopt to changes.  Information in disaster management is fragmented (Oktari et al. 
2020), there is a gap in sharing information in the aspect of disaster management strategies. 
1.1 Objectives  
This paper examined the use of knowledge management in different phases of disaster management to validate the 
benefits of knowledge management in the reduction of disaster impacts as well as improving disaster resiliency.   This

6. Conclusion
The study aims to explore how individuals and the communities applied their knowledge in disaster preparedness 
before, during and after disaster.  The study illustrates that knowledge management could be utilized by the community 
before, during and after a major disaster happened.  The study shows that the community were able to apply the 
guidelines set by authorities during training and simulation. The study was able to explore the actual response by the 
people who experienced the disaster, thus having a better understanding of how people apply their knowledge. 
However, further improvement in the aspect of knowledge transfer is still necessary to have more participants and to 
encourage more communities to conduct disaster preparedness training and simulations.  Since most of the information 
came from social media and mass media the use of technology should be adopted.

Abstract 
There is an ongoing challenge in the healthcare sector to meet increased demand. Deployment of innovative 
technologies is one of the ways to enhance the level of service level in this sector. Blockchain technology has 
several advantages, such as immutability, security and transparency, which can address major issues in the 
healthcare supply chain. This research investigates the impact of blockchain technology on hospital supply chain 
performance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Underlined by task-technology fit theory, a conceptual framework 
of blockchain technology utilisation and its impact on hospital performance is developed. Responses are collected 
from managers working in both public and private hospitals. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs-
QCA) is used to analyse the impact of blockchain technology on hospital supply chain performance. The results 
revealed that causal conditions task characteristics (TC), blockchain characteristics (BC), Individual 
characteristics (IC), task-technology fit (TTF) and blockchain utilisation (BU) are necessary and sufficient for 
higher levels of hospital performance. The study findings also contribute to an in-depth understanding of how 
blockchain technology can enhance the healthcare supply chain system by improving its privacy, safety and 
transparency.

1. Introduction
Globally, the healthcare sector is considered one of the most important and complex industries and is experiencing 
rapid growth. The healthcare management system refers to a wide range of processes that includes financial 
management, legal issues, employees, patients, supply chains, logistics, facilities and inventories (Khatoon 2020). 
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the Ministry of Health (MoH) monitors the overall management of public 
and private health facility services. Under the supervision of the MoH, the healthcare system in Saudi Arabia is 
organised into primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare (Ministry of Health 2018; Almalki et al. 2011). The aim 
of the healthcare system in the KSA is to provide an integrated network of health services for both citizens and 
residents (Khan et al. 2020).  
In recent years, expenditure on Saudi healthcare has increased to meet the health needs of the population. As a 
result, healthcare organisations are facing significant pressure, and governments are investing large amounts of 
money to ensure the delivery of quality healthcare (Rahman and Al-Borie 2020; Al-Hanawi 2017). The healthcare 
system has started to implement digital transformation strategies to keep pace with technological advancements, 
improve service quality and align with Saudi Vision 2030 (Khashan 2017; Ministry of Health 2018). One of the 
technologies for augmenting and improving processes within healthcare system management is blockchain 
technology; which can help to address healthcare issues and increase the capability of organisations to better 
manage their systems (Ben Fekih and Lahami 2020). Blockchain technology is defined as a distributed ledger that 
enables all participants to exchange and store transactions in a database immutably. It is designed as linked 
‘blocks’ that allow management of data records with transparency, security and privacy (Ben Fekih and Lahami 
2020; Reda et al. 2020). 
Recent research highlights that blockchain technology is one of the emerging technologies that will play a critical 
role in the digital health sector revolution (Khatoon 2020). These new technologies will deliver many advantages 
for achieving efficient and effective healthcare practice by increasing quality, authenticity, information 
transparency, traceability, safety and privacy (Gaynor et al. 2020).

were used to assess hospital supply chain performance, and identified and supplied what is required in the context 
of the healthcare industry. It conducted an in-depth understanding of blockchain technology implementation on 
hospital performance. The findings revealed that TC, BC and IC combined with TTF and BU to increase the 
system performance of hospitals. It also proved that it is possible to achieve a high level of performance in the 
hospital system with the adoption of blockchain technology. The findings also refer that there is a positive 
relationship between TTF and hospital system performance, and between BU and hospital system performance. 
This paper has important implications for managers and decision-makers to establish best practices for enhancing 
healthcare performance and devising systems that improve hospital performance through adoption of blockchain 
technology to achieve high levels of privacy, safety and transparency in hospital systems. Moreover, this research 
included a set of guidelines on the implementation of blockchain technology in the health system in the KSA that 
may result in increased blockchain adoption throughout the healthcare industry. Overall, configurational 
approaches to fuzzy sets theory provide novel contributions to this research field.

Abstract 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) has become essential as a result of the acceleration of digitalization and the 
necessity of companies to integrate their business processes. ERP has various models depending on the system 
scalability e.g. for small and medium entities (SME) and enterprises. PT Gamma is one of the food and beverage 
chains with massive growth in Indonesia which uses Oracle NetSuite (ERP for SME). Due to non-scalability, 
management decided to migrate to the enterprise ERP not so long after usage. This research follows the roadmap of 
six sigma (DMAI: define, measure, analyze and improve): (1) define the root cause of non-optimum implementation 
of ERP using in-depth structured interviews with key users; (2) measure the sigma value based on projects 
document; (3) analyze and code interview result to define which Critical Success Factors (CSFs) are more 
dominants then distribute questionnaire (1-10 scale) to define the Risk Priority Number (RPN); and (4) formulate 
solutions for dominant issues and ask key users for verification. Sigma value showed 3.234 (moderate level) through 
calculations number of outstanding issues compared to all issues rose during January-August 2022. Dominant 
factors identified by decision-makers are technological (71%) and organizational factors (19%), meanwhile 
supporting users are technological (42%), organizational (25%) and external party factors (17%). Suggestions for 
management are the alignment of ERP selection with the long-term company’s strategic vision, avoiding over-
customization, performing regular checkpoints, and selecting the best consultant for re-migration. Suggestions for 
further research are a longer research period and a more extensive method of six-sigma.

1. Introduction
ERP systems play an important role in modern business technology enabling organizations and companies to gain a 
competitive advantage in today's demanding business environment. These companies and organizations made 
significant investments in the ERP system to help synergize the “4M (man, money, material, and machines)”. More 
than 60% of companies registered as “Fortune 500” companies use ERP to integrate business data and support 
critical business functions (El-Telbany & Elragal, 2017). According to Bain & Company, the main operational 
business processes managed by the ERP system consist of: (1) inventory and materials; (2) manufacturing; (3) sales 
and distribution; and (4) accounting.

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
Based on the results of the evaluation of project documents (issue logs) during January-August 2022, PT Gamma's 
sigma value is moderate, namely at 3,243 because the company has minimized unnecessary customizations and is 
looking for workarounds if there are implementation limitations on the system. Based on the coding of interviews 
and questionnaires to measure the RPN index from the results of these interviews, the dominant factors in 
implementation are: (1) technological (2) organizational; and (3) external factors. Another factor that is also 
influential but not dominant is the human resource factor. The less influential factor is project management because 
both the decision makers and the main users feel that the existing project management is good, the communication 
between the consultant and PT Gamma is good and progress is updated regularly.  
 
PT Gamma chose a good decision to replace the current ERP system (Oracle NetSuite) with a Small Medium Entity 
(SME) business scale to an ERP system for a larger business scale of ERP (SAP Cloud Hana) after considering the 
return on investment (ROI) of both decisions. PT Gamma has also made a good decision to consider the selection of 
an enterprise ERP system according to the long-term needs and roadmap of the company (manufacturing company). 
SAP (more suitable for the manufacturing industry) than Oracle (more suitable for the service industry) after 
benchmarking against similar industries that have succeeded in using the system. PT Gamma chose to use a 
premium (first tier) consultant who is a top player in system migration and has realized the importance of qualified 
consultants in the successful implementation of the system. With this, risks such as re-migration due to changing 
consultants can be minimized.  
 
Based on interviews with decision makers and business users, the suggestions that can be given are: (1) conduct a 
detailed review for the blue print and consider future practicability for system customization; (2) coordinate with 
consultants to make detailed user guides/manual books according to the company's business processes; (3) conduct 
regular training whenever there is a new module to be implemented; (4) perform UAT (User Acceptance Test) using 
data as real as possible in the sandbox; (5) perform data cleansing before data is entered into production; and (6) 
conduct regular post implementation audits, to check whether the objective of a system modification is in 
accordance with the company's goals. Due to the limited time of the study and also the object of research, the 
researcher recommends further research to use DMAIC method – Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control 
(not only DMAIC – Define, Measure, Analyze, and Improve) and extends the research period to get more robust 
research results.

Abstract 
Currently, the competition in the oil and gas retail industry especially fuel petrol station is very competitive and all of 
them improve the quality of service. This paper discusses research findings to analyze service quality at fuel petrol 
stations in Indonesia using the SERVQUAL integrated BWM. The aim is to determine the quality of service especially 
digitalization service at fuel petrol station in Jakarta, Indonesia. SERVQUAL dimension data were collected from 
several sources such as expertise, literature, corporate rules, and pertamina way. Data collection was carried out by 
distributing questionnaires according to the SERVQUAL rules and using the BWM approach. This study examines 
state-owned fuel petrol station companies located in Jakarta. In the first stage, service quality analysis was carried out 
with 5 dimensions of Servqual (Service Quality), after each value was obtained on servqual, the quality dimension 
was weighted using BWM (Best Worst Method). In addition, the weighting must be combine of criteria and subcriteria 
to be global. The results depends on score of consistency ratio. This study findings that dimension of ""Mobile 
Application"", ""Network Speed"", and ""Interface Mobile App user friendly” require improvement so that service to the 
digitalization of fuel petrol stations increases. Although there are limitations in this study, the future study can be 
adopted in several service company and with others method such as AHP, WASPAS, etc.

1. Introduction
In the service sector, customer satisfaction is more subjective because it is more important than the production sector 
For this reason, customer satisfaction is an expression of feelings that arise due to differences between the customer's 
real experience and customer expectations from the service (Tumsekcali et al., 2021). Quality is the level of customer 
satisfaction and is explained through service quality indicators (Stefano et al., 2015). Measuring the level of service 
quality is measured through assessing customer perceptions. Providing the best quality of service and prioritizing the 
best customer satisfaction is the goal of the Company (Awasthi et al., 2011). One of the industries in the service sector 
is fuel petrol station services. In the current era of digitalization, one of the improvements in service at fuel petrol 
stations is by digitizing fuel petrol stations. 
Referring to BPH Migas Regulation Number 06 of 2013 concerning the Use of Information Technology in the 
Distribution of Fuel Oil. Through the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Letter No. 2548/10/MEM.S/2018 
dated March 22 2018, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources asked the Minister of BUMN to instruct Oil and 
Gas Company state owned to immediately implement the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 191 through 
digitization. As a follow-up on August 31, 2018, Oil and Gas Company state owned with ICT Company state owned 
joining BPH Migas also explained that the implementation of digitizing fuel petrol stations has three stages, namely 
installing ATG (Automatic Tank Gauge) for storage tanks, installing EDC (Electronic Data Capture) to change 
payments from previously cash to cashless and the last is installing video analytics or CCTV. (Closed Circuit 
Television) whose purpose is to record and record police vehicle numbers, so that it is hoped that subsidized fuel will 
be properly monitored.

5. Conclusion
After doing all the calculations on the Global CR and global weighting for all respondents, it was found that the 
Verification and weighting were still below the CR threshold. The results show that points 8, 14, and 9 have the highest 
weight, namely the criteria for ""Mobile Application"", ""Network Speed"", and ""Interface Mobile App user friendly"". 
This shows that these three criteria require improvement so that service to the digitalization of fuel petrol stations 
increases.

Abstract 
The world is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Indonesia is one of the affected countries. This led to a shift in 
doing our daily activities from the physical into digital in various industries, including education industries. The digital 
(online) activity must be done using gadget in teaching and learning process. Teachers and students used Zoom, 
Gmeet, Whatsapp, and other online platforms to interact with the students. However, students tend to lose their focus 
easily with this learning method. They have a habit of opening social media ang games while studying. These apps 
are apps which consume student’s limited package data.  Therefore, not only are they distracted by opening these 
applications, the student’s quota is also used ineffectively. FOQUS application is an application to block students from 
opening irrelevant applications during class. This application was made to reduce student’s data package consumption 
and help students in retaining their focus during online class. The implementation method starts from meetings and 
introductions to establish partnership with students, teachers, and authors in Yayasan Pembangun Didikan Islam 
(YPDI), application design and development, socialization to teachers and students, and application implementation 
in teaching and learning activities. Evaluation was carried out periodically during the implementation process. 
Application design and development activities were carried out for 2 months, socialization was carried out to 6A and 
6B grade students and accompanying teachers, then the implementation was carried out 2 times, namely before and 
after using the FOQUS application. During implementation, it was found that many students wanted to open other 
applications while studying but could not successfully open them because they were already using the FOQUS 
application. At the end of each session, a post-test was conducted to students from each class. This study found that 
students who used the application saved 2,32% data package compared with students who don’t. The students score 
from each class increased. Class 6A average score increased from 61,2 to 64,4. Class 6B average score increased 
dramatically from 44,1 to 62,7. This result supports FOQUS application use might have an effect in supporting 
student’s retention on the lesson being taught. However, external factor (classroom condition) and internal factor 
(individual intelligence, habits) might also have an influence in the student’s class performance.

Abstract 
This paper presents a systematic and bibliometric review of a closed-loop supply chain pricing strategy focusing on 
the perspective of carbon emission and game theory. A pricing strategy is a model to establish the best price for a 
product or service to maximize profits while considering consumer and market demand. In this review, carbon 
emission and game theory are used to reflect the economic and environmental relationship. Price strategy in a closed-
loop supply chain is quite complex due to its specific operations involving collection, reuse, recycle, refurbish, repair 
and or recondition. Using bibliometric data of 165 research articles from Scopus database between year 2010 until 
2022, the outcomes are visualized using VOSviewer. The bibliometric analysis was carried out on trends, rankings, 
authors, countries, universities, citations, and network visualizations. The content analysis is being done to find out 
the research purpose, carbon emission policy, type of game, condition, and environmental policy of the research. The 
result shown that this research area has kept growing, especially in the last five years. Journal of Cleaner Production 
is the leading journal in this field. China is the country that has the highest contribution with the most affiliations of 
the author referring to Shanghai Maritime University. Most of the research investigates how to minimize cost, reduce 
carbon emission and maximize profit by using Stackelberg and Nash game in deterministic conditions. 
Remanufacturing is the highest environmental policy used by researchers. This paper provides a comprehensive 
bibliometric analysis of pricing strategy considering CLCS and Game Theory perspectives. It will contribute to 
academics and professional’s determining pricing strategies and future research directions.

1. Introduction
Global warming and climate change are the main effects of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (Lee and 
Tang, 2018; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2021). Numerous efforts, for example, Conference of Parties (COP), the Kyoto 
Protocol and the Paris Agreement have been made to establish carbon emission mitigation policies (Van Wassenhove, 
2019; Dev et al., 2020). Carbon emission regulations, carbon taxes and carbon limits (carbon caps, carbon caps and 
trade or carbon offsets) are applied to increase public and corporate awareness about the destructive effects of carbon 
emissions (Taleizadeh, Shahriari et al., 2021).  
Carbon emission sources are transportation, electricity production, industry, commercial, residential and agricultural. 
The manufacturing industry produces raw materials and goods that we use for daily life contributes significantly to 
carbon emissions. There are two types of carbon emission from the industrial sector; direct emissions that occur during 
production and indirect emissions in connection with electricity used for the production facility. In the United States, 
the manufacturing industry is responsible for 23% of carbon emissions, while in Indonesia, the industrial sector 
contributes 28% of releasing carbon emissions (Environmental Protection Agency). 
Many countries are starting to adopt and enforce carbon emission policies through the supply chain and circular 
economy approaches. Closed Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) refers to a supply chain with forward logistics for material 
procurement, production, distribution and reverse logistics to collect, process and return products and/or parts of 
products to restore the value of sustainable products (Mavi et al., 2017; Batista et al., 2018). By implementing CLSC,

Abstract 
This paper is to develop a performance prediction model of an integrated system that combines a solar heat pump and 
an air heat pump based on the DNN (Deep Neural Network) model. In this paper, we describe the overall procedure 
for building a DNN model to predict the performance of an integrated system, including the data collection method, 
data set construction, and DNN model structure. To validate the reliability of the performance prediction model based 
on the DNN model, the mean square error of the coefficient of variation CV(RMSE) proposed by the American Society 
of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers Guideline 14 was used. The RMSE between the prediction 
result of the CV DNN model and the output variable was calculated as 5%. Therefore, the reliability of the performance 
prediction model based on the DNN model was verified, and the performance prediction accuracy was similar to the 
energy simulation model.

1. Introduction
New and renewable energy technologies that can produce energy are being introduced to realize zero-energy buildings, 
but single technologies centered on solar power, solar heat, and geothermal heat pumps are mostly applied. . New and 
renewable energy single technology has limitations in realizing zero energy buildings due to problems such as 
temporal and quantitative inconsistency of energy supply and demand, securing sufficient installation space, and initial 
cost. (Bae, 2022; Lee, 2016) 
Therefore, it is essential to develop a new and renewable energy convergence system that can handle all the energy 
demands (hot, cold, electric power) of a building in one system to overcome the technical limitations of a single 
renewable energy technology and implement it efficiently. A new and renewable energy fusion system that combines 
a solar-thermal module and a geothermal or air source heat pump to supply heat and electricity to a building at the 
same time has been proposed. 
Abu et al. (2020) tried to overcome the high power consumption and power shortage of buildings in Jordan using the 
solar-geothermal source heat pump fusion system and reviewed the feasibility of the fusion system through energy 
simulation. As a result, the COP (coefficient of performance) of the fusion system could be improved by 35% 
compared to the single system of the geothermal heat pump due to the combined use of solar and underground heat 
sources. Ruoping et al. (2021) evaluated the applicability of the solar heat-geothermal source fusion system for the 
purpose of realizing a zero energy building in rural detached houses using energy simulation. It was confirmed that 
the zero energy building can be achieved as the power output of the solar heat module is higher than the power 
consumption of the system. Li and Huang (2022) proposed a double heat source heat pump combined with a solar 
heat module to solve the instability of the existing air heat source heat pump and improve energy efficiency. This 
system was able to produce heat and electricity at the same time by effectively utilizing a solar power source and an 
air heat source. In addition, compared to the existing air heat source heat pump, the double heat source heat pump was 
able to maintain stable performance even in poor environments. Ai et al. (2022) proposed a system in which an air 
heat source heat pump and a photovoltaic module are combined. The system performance was compared depending

3. Conclusion
In this study, the performance prediction model of the deep neural network-based solar-air heat source heat pump 
convergence system was developed, and the reliability of the developed performance prediction model was verified 
through the CV (RMSE) error analysis method proposed in ASHRAE Guideline 14.  
The input variables of the solar-air heat source heat pump convergence system were collected using energy simulation, 
and the data were refined through the Pearson correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination. The refined 
21 input variables were divided into learning, validation, and evaluation, and a data set was constructed through a 
random number algorithm and data normalization. 
A deep neural network model capable of learning non-linear combinations and relationships between input variables 
was constructed. The structure of the deep neural network model consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an 
output layer, and the number of nodes in the input layer is set to 21, and the number of nodes in the hidden layer is set 
to 43. The number of hidden layers was determined to be two through a case study.

The CV (RMSE) between the predicted result value of the deep neural network model and the output variable was 
calculated to be 5%. Therefore, it is judged that the performance prediction model of the deep neural network-based 
solar-air heat source heat pump convergence system developed in this study has reliability.

Abstract 
Home Health Care (HHC) becomes a promising service among the health care services, due to the numerous benefits 
it offers such as increasing the ‘stay at home’ rate, freeing the hospitals from the cases where care could be provided 
at home, reducing health care costs and being aligned with the contemporary social needs.  Nonetheless, the 
complexity factors involved in HHC services make the efficient management of such activity, from an operations 
management point of view, hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a functional scheme of the service with a 
description of the HHC problem settings. We also detail the decisions at different planning levels that have an impact 
on HCC service performance. Finally, we give an overview of the different modeling and solving approaches that 
have been used in the literature  to address the HCC service issues, and we end up with a discussion and future research 
directions.

1. Introduction
Home Health Care (HHC) is an alternative to conventional hospitalization in a health structure, which consists of 
delivering medical and paramedical care needed to a patient while the patient remains at home. The objective of HCC 
is to shorten hospital stays or even avoid them in order to reduce the congestion phenomenon in hospitals, while 
guaranteeing a good quality care service to patients (Benzarti et al. 2013).  In recent years, the HHC service tends to 
become an important component of the health sector that has grown significantly, i.e. the employer firm revenue in 
the U.S. home health care service sector went from 43,233 (million US Dollars)  in 2006 to 102,723 (million US 
dollars) in 2020  (https://www.statista.com/statistics/206518/us-home-health-care-service -employer-firm-revenue), 
in response to several factors such as demographic changes (aging of the population) increase in the percentage of the 
population with chronic diseases or physical or mental disabilities,the development of new technologies such as 
nanotechnology or telemedicine, but also to the continuous pressure from governments to control health expenditure. 
The COVID-19 pandemic further accentuated this demand when hospitals were faced with saturation of capacity to 
meet the demand for health services (Lin. et al. 2021). In addition to the increase in demand factor, the HCC service 
tends to be more popular due to many advantages it provides. Indeed, the care is more personalized with more 
attention, since the caregiver only has one patient at a time, while being surrounded by family which gives comfort, 
support and the peace of mind in most cases in addition to the patient-care worker relationship reinforcement (Cissé, 
et. al.  2017). 
The increase in demand for the HHC service puts it under great pressure due to the various factors of uncertainty it 
has to face such as the frequency and location of patient demand, the type and duration of the care project per patient, 
the diversity, availability and location of stakeholders in the care project (doctors, nurses, social workers, transport 
providers, medical laboratories, equipment agencies, patients), the diversity of objectives (cost reduction, 
improvement of service quality, improvement of patient safety and comfort, balanced distribution of caregivers' 
workload, etc.), not to mention the context based factors related to the regulations, laws (Sahin and Matta, 2014).

possibility of a multi modal transportation that would allow according to (Fika and Hirsch  2016) a better optimization 
especially if we combine different modes and consider public transport (Cissé et. al. 2017). 
 
The service doesn’t lack the variability and randomness. Therefore having researches that would take the stochastic 
as well as the dynamic aspects via quantitative models resulting in forceful operations would have a high benefit (Fikar 
and Hirsch  2016). Staying in quantified models, (Sahin and Matta 2014) propose to have a quantified model enabling 
us chosing or a strategic organizational profitable coordination. 
 
Time related future research could be described as the most complex. From a supply chain perspective, (Sahin and 
Matta 2014) invite researches to consider models for managing supply chains including sourcing and synchronizing 
of the material resources for various geographically dispersed actors (providers of non-consumable goods, logistic 
service in charge of delivery (availability), lifespan of some medications, return flows of unspent supplies, emergency 
contingency plans, equipment failure or shortage scenarios). Zooming to the routing and scheduling problems,  (Cissé, 
et al. 2017) propose multiple time windows outlining all of the patient's available times.

Abstract 
Risk is an inevitable situation where it occurs due to an uncertain event and it causes to the damage and loss. The 
involvement of the supply chain integration and supply chain risk management in handling the disruptions playing a 
pivotal role in firms where, it is a way to control unexpected situation and reduce to the vulnerability. Thus, this study 
exploring about the effect of supply chain integration and supply chain risk management among Malaysian Small and 
Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This study using quantitative approach which applied exploring research design. 
Instrument was used in this research is questionnaires with 5 Likert scales. A total of 211 respondents have been 
selected according to the criteria stated, and random sampling used. The criteria of the respondents are a manager or 
someone who are knowledgeable about supply chain management in their firm. PLS-SEM was used for analyses the 
data of this study. As a result, shows (β=0.466, t=6.202 and p=0.000). Therefore, there is a significant relationship 
between supply chain integration and supply chain risk management has found in this study.

1. Introduction
The highly competitive business environment and economic challenges can influence supply chain activities and 
performance, especially in small-medium enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, globalisation and information technology 
can affect the world economy by creating healthy, sustainable, and rapid supply chain management (Xu et al. 2014). 
The pressures of reducing the trade barriers while advancing in transportation and information and communications 
technology to grow supply chain companies beyond the national level (Golini and Kalchschmidt, 2011). The global 
supply chain analysed the different perspectives such as global value chains, networks, and double multichip on 
systems by focusing on the firm view, especially in managing the source, manufacturing, and distribution on the global 
scale (Golini and Kalchschmidt, 2011). 
In Malaysian, SMEs plays an essential role in economic development where the 90% of the businesses was form by 
the SMEs, about 32% of the SMEs contributes to the gross domestic product (Gunto and Alias, 2013). The SMEs 
consider as a national economy backbone, it helps to improve the country social and political stability and servies as 
a crucial growth engine in many countries (Barwani et al. 2014). Malaysian SMEs have great potential to develop 
significant domestic sourcing by integrating the supply chain to support the nation's economy (Ha et al. 2016; Chain 
et al. 2014). The Malaysian government is focused on SMEs' growth and development to achieve Vision 2020 of 
1435",,"Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022

for enhancing the effectiveness of the supply chain risk in Malaysian SMEs. In other words, supply chain integration 
motivating of managing the risk of supply chain. There is a few study in integration of supply chain and the supply 
chain risk management in empirical study. 
This study has found the supply chain integration has a significant effect on the supply chain risk management among 
Malaysian SMEs. Similar to the study by Munir et al. (2020), the dimensions of supply chain integration, internal 
integration, supplier integration, and customer integration positively affect supply chain risk. Supply chain integration 
helps in mitigating the risks and also improving the supply chain risk management, which are the supplier integration 
and customer integration help in reducing the information distortion and leading in accurate of the information in 
supply chain activities such as the accurate of forecasting of the demand, the efficiency of the allocation of resources 
and lowering the bullwhip effect (Schoenherr and Swink, 2012). 
The study by Wiengarten et al. (2016) has differ result was rejected the relationship between supply chain integration 
and supply chain risk management, where they found the supply chain risk may not able to complemented their supply 
chain integration because of the week rule of law environment. Supported by the research study of Bozarth et al. 
(2008) has found the supply chain integration especially the supply chain delivery risk has negatively related.  
Thus overall as the model was fit satisfying the confirmatory factor analysis criteria it is confirmed that the supply 
chain integration positively influences the supply chain risk of Malaysian SMEs.

Abstract 
This study shows the assessment of mental workload for jeepney drivers in Tanay, Rizal. This aims to observe the 
bottleneck and evaluate jeepney drivers’ circumstances that affect their mental workload and identify the factors 
influencing the mental workload of the jeepney drivers while on duty. The researchers applied Slovin’s Formula to 
get the correct sample size appropriate for the study. The mental workload of the jeepney drivers was assessed through 
the use of NASA-TLX (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index) with six subscales such as 
mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. The six-step measurements 
in NASA TLX were also used in this study, i.e., weighting, provision rating, scoring, weighted workload (WWL), 
weighted workload score, and scoring interpretation. In accordance with the gathered data, the research shows that the 
indicator physical demand (PD), with a score of 351.46, which is in the very high category on the scale, is the most 
dominant factor among all the other indicators, and frustration level, with a score of 98.33, will be the least contributor 
factor among the remaining five indicators. Furthermore, the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used by 
the researchers to compare the means of two or more independent variables and to see if there is statistical evidence 
that the related population means differ significantly. Findings conclude that physical demand is the most prominent 
among all the indicators and the leading contributor to the mental workload of the jeepney drivers that drive trips 
along the Tanay-Siliuan route.

1. Introduction
Jeepneys, or jeeps, were considered to be the backbone of the transport system in the Philippines. And yet, jeepney 
drivers are perceived to have the lowest socio-economic standing (Güss & Tuazon, 2008), regardless of the fact that 
they are the substantial mode of transport across any municipality in the Philippines. Due to the vast number of 
jeepneys and jeepney drivers on the road at all hours of the day and night, jeepneys are commonly recognized as the 
most common and least expensive method of transportation in the Philippines.  
Driving a vehicle is a complicated task that can involve significant shifts in mental workload. Drivers must process a 
lot of information coming from outside the vehicle, such as traffic intensity, traffic signs, and so on, because people 
interconnection, entertainment devices, and navigation systems increase the amount of incoming data inside the 
vehicle. This signifies that the increased availability of information necessitates an increase in the demand for visual 
and auditory resources, which has a direct impact on mental workload. Such laborious tasks experience heavy and

3. A proposal to redesign the jeepney models with regards to its extensive vibration caused by the engine and the force 
needed to be exerted by the drivers on the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift as such factors has the ability to cause 
a direct effect to the drivers’ discomfort and physical demand upon performing the task. This is also in relation with 
the data gathered which showed that the physical demand (pushing, pulling, turning, controlling, etc.) contributes the 
most in the mental workload that the jeepney driver’s experiences.  
 
4. Application of further jeepney modifications designed by Coz, et al. (2015) to improve the workspace and working 
conditions of the drivers. This includes modification of the driver’s seat into a seat that is more properly contoured for 
their buttocks and back rest, with dimensions to properly accommodate the drivers and a head rest as majority of the 
jeepneys doesn’t include a head rest. Furthermore, they have also proposed to increase the height of the windshield as 
the usual jeepney windshield size is very narrow and cause backaches for the jeepney drivers for they have to 
frequently bend forward to properly observe traffic lights or call passengers. 
 
For future studies, the researchers recommend looking into ways to better improve the mentioned extensive vibrations 
such as engine age, fuel used, weight capacity or the overall build of the engine. Future researchers can also take into 
account the amount of force that is required in the driving controls. Aside from this, further studies can also consider 
a wider scope of limitations and greater quantity of sample size to attain and acquire a greater representation of data. 
 
7. Conclusion 
This study was conducted by the researchers in order to provide a comprehensive assessment and measurement on the 
jeepney driver’s mental workload on Tanay-Siniluan route while they are on their duty and determine which factor 
poses as the major bottleneck in the day-to-day mental workload of the jeepney drivers. Thus, the correlation between 
the indicators and the average working hours shows statistically significant data with Effort (EF), Physical Demand 
(PD), and Performance (OP). The correlation matrix for mental workload indicators displays p-values less than 0.05 
for three (3) indicators: effort (EF) and physical demand (PD), frustration level (FR) and temporal demand (TD), and 
frustration level (FR) and effort (EF). In accordance with the gathered data, the research shows that the indicator 
physical demand (PD) with the score of 351.46, which is on the very high category on the scale, is the apparently the 
most dominant factor among all the other indicators. This indicates that the volume and magnitude of the  physical 
demand necessary to accomplish the task is very high and can be considered as the major contributor to the mental 
workload of the jeepney drivers on the mentioned scope. On the other hand, the frustration level with the score of 
98.33, although still on the high category of the scale, has the lowest score and indicates that the insecurity, stress and 
irritation felt by the drivers upon the duration of the completion of task is the least contributor to the mental workload 
the jeepney drivers have experienced on performing their jobs.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed the education system and forced schools to adopt online teaching. 
However, it affects the teachers' workload globally. The study aims to assess the workload level of the 95 teachers at 
the Technological Institute of the Philippines - Manila during the online setup. Using the NASA Task Load Index 
assessment tool, the researchers could evaluate the different workload sources. The Analysis of Variance and 
pairwise correlation analysis were also used so that the researchers could determine if their demographic profile 
significantly affects their current workload and if the different sources have a significant relationship with each 
other. After this, the findings revealed an 80.86% on teachers' workload level, which is greater than workload 
acceptability. The current setup also demands good performance, intense thinking, and effort in the new learning 
setup. The researchers found that the result is still the same even though they are weighted based on their 
demographic profile. Moreover, there is a low positive relationship between temporal and mental demand and a very 
low positive relationship between effort and performance. The relationships between effort and temporal demand, 
performance, and temporal demand also show a low negative correlation. At the same time, there is a very low 
negative relationship between frustration and physical demand, performance and mental demand, and physical and 
mental demand. The recommended practices for the school and teachers are also created to help them ease and 
reduce zoom fatigue without jeopardizing the quality of education they deliver to the students.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 has infected 94 million individuals and caused 2 million fatalities in 191 countries (John Hopkins 
University, 2021, cited in Barrot et al., 2021). It led the government to cancel national exams and schools to 
temporarily shut down, stop face-to-face teaching, and observe the physical distance, which has disrupted 1.5 billion 
children’s education. These events triggered higher education's digital transition and tested its capacity to adapt 
quickly. Pham and Nguyen (2020), as well as Simbulan (2020), stated that some schools had an easy transition while 
others, especially those in underdeveloped nations, struggled (cited in Barrot et al., 2021). 
As a result, the Technological Institute of the Philippines (T.I.P.) decided to utilize the learning platform, Canvas, to 
continue delivering excellent quality learning during the pandemic. However, due to the fast transition, the 
institution faced challenges in preparing the teachers regarding efficient methods to manage virtual classes. Hence, 
the school's management implemented a new setup that divides the module into three modular groups for college 
programs. The teachers will teach their designated courses within six weeks per modular group. But it can be more

and commonly referred to as the Urgent-Important Matrix, was a prioritizing technique employed to 
identify which jobs required urgent attention and could wait (Mfondoum et al., 2019). It may assist teachers 
in remaining focused on the activities that will ultimately increase their effectiveness (Hendricks, 2018). 
3. To address the instructors’ concerns regarding the interaction and participation of their students' live 
conference (online discussion), they should use data analytics as it shows statistics of how many hours a 
student stayed in the conference room and how active they were in the discussion. Moreover, instructors 
may come up with a new and exciting way of having recitation, or an in-class (after) activity, such as using 
interactive websites like Kahoot, Quizziz, and Slido. This may cause the students to listen attentively in 
their live discussions. Additionally, the professors may give attendance incentives that boost students' 
motivation to attend classes. 
 
4. According to the findings, module preparation is one of the professors' most challenging aspects of 
teaching. Therefore, the recommended practice based on the study and thorough investigation is to allow 
two days of preparation before the start of the modular group. In addition, the T.I.P. administration may 
assign academic personnel to create the compilation of modules from reliable sources that the professors 
will utilize. 
 
5. Regarding the students' requirements, the professors at T.I.P. Manila encounter a challenge in finishing the 
papers (e.g., capstone or thesis advising and paneling), which extends their time working on accomplishing 
the tasks. Therefore, the researcher recommended that the school administrator should motivate the 
professor to enhance their teaching performance by providing recognition or even incentives such as 
getting an additional 10% of their hourly rate, which serves as overtime pay for the time dedicated to 
paneling and other academic-related works that are held outside their working schedule. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The result from the conducted survey reveals that the online classes caused the teachers at Technological Institute of 
the Philippines – Manila to have zoom fatigue due to several conferences, meetings, and classes conducted virtually. 
The online setup also makes most of them feel drained, burned out, frustrated, irritated, and stressed. It is due to 
their prolonged exposure to computers, poor internet connection, and too much workload, which are also the main 
contributors to the decrease in professors' performance in teaching virtually. Moreover, the study findings showed 
that the most challenging work aspect is checking requirements and meeting deadlines because they have many 
students and subjects to handle, especially when there are late submissions. It is hard for the teachers to check the 
students' papers online, causing them to have prolonged exposure to their computers. According to them, the 
Modular Group (MG) development is poor, and its schedule (6 weeks per modular group) is not enough for most 
college teachers to discuss all the lessons since it is fast-paced and has limited time. The current setup also requires 
more module preparation since they handle many subjects. Each has a different preparation, which is time-
consuming, and needs to fit all the topics within the schedule of 6 weeks. 
 
This result supports why the present workload level (80.86%) of teachers in an online class is well beyond 50, which 
means it is less acceptable. Moreover, the study reveals that their online class demands good performance and 
intense mentality or thinking, significantly affecting their workload. Too much workload could also have a reverse 
effect on the teachers' performance and may affect their mental health. On the other hand, teachers' demographic 
profile does not have a significant impact on their workload. The correlation analysis also showed that the 
relationship between temporal and mental demand and between effort and performance indicates a weak to very 
weak positive relationship. In addition, there is a weak to very weak negative correlation between effort and 
temporal demand, performance and temporal demand, frustration and physical demand, performance and mental 
demand, and physical and mental demand. These results suggest that it will considerably enhance the TIP teachers' 
overall working routine and level of service by addressing the employees' mental demand, physical demand, 
temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration.

Abstract 
Cryptocurrency price fluctuations are very complicated to solve. Some practitioners of cryptocurrency traders suspect 
that socio-political variables also often become the determinants of the price of this digital asset commodity. However, 
these assumptions are not certain. However, for traders this is actually an assumption to decide to invest in 
cryptocurrency assets. In other words, the subjective assumptions of traders have become a reference for dealing with 
price uncertainty in the future, while on the other hand cryptocurrency asset investment is a type of investment that is 
high risk and high return, with a very extreme level of price volatility. This condition confirms that forecasting future 
prices is not an easy matter. Requires precise and scientific fundamental analysis. The novelty of this research is to 
present in detail the fundamental analysis, what factors determine the fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency assets. 
Where the results of this study aim to be an investment reference for market participants, including investors, 
especially for novice investors in investing, so as to minimize risk and get maximum profits. The method used in this 
study is descriptive analysis, with the N-Vivo tools approach as an analytical tool. The data used is sourced from 
https://tradingeconomics.com/ which presents cryptocurrency price fluctuations and https://tradingeconomics.com/ 
which displays economic fundamental indicators. The results of this study found that the economic factors that 
determine cryptocurrency price fluctuations are determined by internal and external factors of an asset. Internal factors 
include the amount of supply of crypto coins and tokens, the amount of market capitalization and the utility aspect of 
the blockchain technology owned. Meanwhile, viewed from external factors, namely influenced by global 
macroeconomy conditions such as inflation trends, interest rates, unemployment rates, growth, investment, trade 
balance, debt, and economic recession, including fiscal and monetary policies. Judging from the social variables, the 
popularity factor (hype), the strength of the community, the role of important figure influencers on a coin and 
cryptocurrency token are variables that affect price fluctuations. Meanwhile, from a political approach, it is influenced 
by regulatory factors and deregulation of the legalization and prohibition of cryptocurrency adoption as well as global 
political instability factors that also affect cryptocurrency assets, for example the phenomenon of war, political 
sanctions, economic embargoes. Finally, when viewed from a psychological approach, among others, caused by 
factors of fear and pesimism and the level of public trust and optimism in the market becomes a psychological 
sentiment for the level of price fluctuations. Thus, it can be concluded that the dominance of economic factors on 
cryptocurrency price fluctuations is still very dominant in determining market prices, but these economic factors do 
not stand alone, but there are social, political and psychological factors that influence the cryptocurrency market price. 
The implication of this research is that market participants should be really careful and conduct in-depth research 
before making investment decisions, not just fear of missing out (FOMO) buying cryptocurrency assets.

Introduction
In recent years, cryptocurrency investment has become very popular in various countries. Where this phenomenon 
occurs globally, which helps boost consumer understanding regarding cryptocurrency literacy (Chen et al., 2022). 
Public interest is quite high for this type of investment, but on the other hand there are still many investors who are 
against and afraid to invest, considering that cryptocurrency is considered an asset full of uncertainty and high risk 
and price manipulation (Dhawan and Putnins, 2020; Bouri, et.al, 2021). In addition, cryptocurrency price fluctuations 
are very complicated to solve, sometimes in line with the principles of the law of demand, but on the other hand 
sometimes it is against the law of demand itself.

5. Conclusion
The results of this study found that the economic factors that determine cryptocurrency price fluctuations are 
determined by internal and external factors of an asset. Internal factors include the amount of supply of crypto coins

Meanwhile, from a political perspective, it is influenced by regulatory factors and deregulation of the legalization and 
prohibition of cryptocurrency adoption as well as global political instability factors that also affect cryptocurrency 
assets, for example the phenomenon of war, political sanctions, economic embargoes. Finally, if viewed from a 
psychological perspective, among others caused by factors of fear and pessimism as well as the level of public trust 
and optimism towards the market become psychological sentiments for the level of price fluctuations. Thus, it can be 
concluded that the dominance of economic factors on cryptocurrency price fluctuations is still very dominant in 
determining market prices, but these economic factors do not stand alone, but there are social, political and 
psychological factors that influence the cryptocurrency market price. 
The implication of this research is that market participants should be really careful and conduct in-depth research 
before making investment decisions, not in a state of fear of missing out (FOMO) buying cryptocurrency assets. 
Meanwhile, the government should have a good understanding of macroeconomic conditions and socio-political and 
psychological conditions, in making regulations and deregulations of the cryptocurrency market, in order to be able 
to generate greater revenue for the state.

Abstract 
Previous Behavioral Operations studies have revealed that there is a significant amount of individuality and 
heterogeneity in the ordering decisions made by human decision makers. Several studies investigated the effect of 
personal factors such as cognitive capabilities, personality traits and cultural norms on these decisions.  In this study 
we conduct a simple lab experiment under newsvendor setting and investigate the effect of national differences in 
Turkish and American decision makers. The experiment scenario is based on two different settings, namely buyback 
setting and an equivalent revenue sharing setting. Specifically, under the buyback setting any leftovers are sold back 
to the supplier (which is represented by the computer) and under the revenue sharing setting for each sale made a 
revenue share is paid to the supplier. The data of the American subjects is obtained from the study conducted by Katok 
and Wu (2009) with the courtesy of the authors. The data of the Turkish subjects is obtained through a new experiment 
designed to match the setting of the American study. Our analysis shows that both groups of decision-makers under 
both settings place orders that are significantly lower than the optimal. For both cultural groups, under revenue sharing 
setting the subjects place lower orders than under buyback setting. Though, the difference is on average. When we 
compare Turkish and American decisions, we see that Turkish subjects place lower orders than American subjects, 
yet the difference is again on average. We also compare both groups in terms of decision heuristics and find that 
demand chasing behavior is more prevalent in the Turkish subjects.

1. Introduction and Literature Review
Over the last 20 years, Behavioral Operations studies have been investigating which factors could be affecting decision 
making behavior under operations management contexts. A significant number of these studies have been focused on 
the newsvendor behavior. The focus on the newsvendor ordering behavior originates from the study contacted by 
Schweitzer and Cachon in 2000. This study revealed that there is a consistent deviation from the optimal that can’t be 
explained by the existing theories of risk-aversion, loss-aversion or prospect theory. Thereafter, many studies are 
conducted in order to find an explanation to this suboptimal behavior. Lau et al. (2014) express that there is a high 
level of heterogeneity among the decisions of each participant. Wu and Chen (2014) attribute this individual 
heterogeneity to the bounded rationality of the subjects. De Vericourt et al. (2001) associate part of this individual 
difference to gender and they show that female subjects place lower order decisions compared to male subjects. After 
a mediating study, they reveal that the reason behind the lower order decisions made by female subjects is due to 
higher risk-aversion. Moritz et al. (2013) show that newsvendor performance is significantly affected by the cognitive 
capabilities of the decision makers. Akbay (2016) demonstrates that self-esteem and regret tendency can also affect 
order decisions. Specifically, decision-makers with higher self-esteem place higher orders, and decision-makers with 
higher regret tendency make orders closer to the demand mean. 
Although few, there are also studies focused on cultural differences in newsvendor behavior. Feng et al. (2011) is the 
first of these studies investigating differences between Chinese and American decision makers. They show that 
Chinese order decisions are closer to the demand mean under both high profit and low profit margins which the authors 
attribute to the Doctrine of the Mean and extremeness aversion that is prevalent in the Chinese culture. Another study 
conducted by Li et al. (2019) find parallel results, again, in comparison of American and Chinese decision-makers. 
They show that Chinese order decisions are more prone to demand chasing and mean anchor heuristics, have higher

4. Conclusion and Discussion
In this study we compare the cross-national differences between Turkish and American decision makers under the 
newsvendor problem. Our analysis shows that there is in fact a significant cultural difference between the two nations 
that affect their ordering behavior. Considering Turkish culture is more conservative, and individualism is more 
prevalent in American culture, we conjecture that Turkish subjects would order smaller quantities and would be 
affected by decision heuristics more and we have found partial support for our hypotheses.  
Here, we must note that the two studies that are compared are conducted by different researchers following different 
procedures. Hence some of the results observed in the data can be attributed to the differences in the experimental 
procedures. What is equally likely is that the procedural differences may have hindered some other differences in the 
ordering behavior. Furthermore, the sample sizes are considerably smaller than the ones that are preferred by the most 
recent studies. This paper should be regarded as an exploratory call for further research into cross-cultural examination 
of the newsvendor behavior.

Abstract 
It has been well established by a plethora of experimental and empirical studies that human decision makers deviate 
from the newsvendor optimal order quantity. In this study we try to predict newsvendor behavior through an out-of-
experiment personality inventory, namely Hexaco-100. We consider a simple scenario of a perishable product with 
random consumer demand. The decision-makers determine the stock quantity for 40 consecutive periods. In this 
exploratory study we investigate if there is any correlation between order decisions or expected and realized profit 
and any of the personal characteristics measured by Hexaco-100. Our results show that order decisions are negatively 
correlated with social self-esteem and fairness. Sincerity and fairness are positively correlated with expected profit 
and realized profit values. Greed-avoidance is also positively correlated with realized profit. The experiment is based 
on low-profit margin setting and generally decision-makers order more than the optimal in this setting. Hence smaller 
order decisions are better and lead to better profit values. Combining this with the correlation results, we conclude 
that subjects with higher social self-esteem, sincerity, fairness and greed-avoidance scores make smaller order 
decisions and earn higher profit values. We also observe significant demand chasing behavior in the data and show 
that “dependence” and “sentimentality” have significant positive correlation with demand chasing behavior.

1. Introduction and Literature Review
Behavioral Operations as a field aims to understand human decision making under complex operations problems. The 
motivation behind the field is that many experimental and empirical studies have shown that human decision-makers 
do not follow the theoretical expectations. For instance Fisher and Raman (1996) have shown with Sport Obermeyer 
case that the order decisions are consistently below the optimal. On the other hand, with the Jeppesen Sanderson case 
Katok et al. (2001) show that the order decisions are systematically over the optimal. Corbett and Fransoo (2007) have 
conducted a survey study with small business owners and showed that the newsvendor logic is used for products with 
high profit margin but not for the best-selling products. The newsvendor model is one of the simplest inventory 
management models that has a wide range of applications. More importantly, the newsvendor model is in more 
complicated supply chain management models. As such, the human decision processes that affect the newsvendor 
ordering behavior have significant importance for a many business areas.  
Newsvendor model is based on random consumer demand and a perishable product. Hence if there are any unsold 
product at the end of the selling period, the products lose their value and the inventory doesn’t carry over to the 
following periods. The problem is to find the order quantity that will maximize the expected profit. The trade-off in 
this problem is that if the order quantity is more than the demand, then there will be unsold products at the end of the 
season, resulting in “cost of overage”. On the other hand, if the order quantity is less than the demand, then potential 
profit would have been forsaken, resulting in “cost of underage”. The optimal order quantity is computed using the 
costs associated with this trade-off. If F(.) is the demand distribution, then the expected profit will be maximized when 
the order quantity is equal to

Schweitzer and Cachon (2000) are the first to publish a Newsvendor experiment study. They show that when the “cost 
of underage” is higher than the “cost of overage” the subjects order less than the optimal, and when the “cost of 
overage” is higher, they order more than the optimal. Later studies also confirmed this systematic, too-low-too-high

4. Conclusion
In this study we explore the correlation between newsvendor ordering behavior and Hexaco personality inventory. 
We show that order decisions are negatively correlated with fairness and social self-esteem scales. Expected profit is 
positively correlated with fairness, social self-esteem and additionally sincerity and honesty-humility as a whole facet. 
When we check the results for realized profit, we see that similar to expected profit it is positively correlated with 
sincerity, fairness, social self-esteem and honesty-humility facet. Additionally, greed-avoidance also positively 
impacts realized profit. Demand chasing behavior is prominent in the ordering decisions. And we see that there is 
significant and positive correlation between dependence and sentimentality scales and demand chasing behavior.  
Though small, we believe these findings are significant for the future research. A bigger study with larger sample sizes 
and both low and high profit margin settings can further investigate these connections we have revealed in this study 
and make an important contribution to the literature.

Abstract 
The following paper aims to take a detailed look at the various stages of IDeS (Industrial Design Engineering), a prime 
example of a modern, cutting-edge methodology useful for laying the groundwork for new product development 
within an organization. Its general outline interfaces with any type of product and is applicable in almost any context, 
from food production to the world of cosmetics, from the biomedical sector to car design. The methodology described 
is orderly and perfectly schematic, so it can govern all departments of a generic company with the goal of product 
development, to the point that its very architecture could be built following the logic of IDeS. From an initial market 
analysis useful for understanding the needs required by the future users of the product, through benchmarking applied 
to competitors in the target market segment, arriving at the study of the actual architecture of the product, all the steps 
of the IDeS will be considered. In detail, the steps of ""Stylistic Design Engineering,"" a purely design approach to 
develop automotive design projects in the industrial world, will be applied to arrive at the final product configuration. 
Serving first Quality Function Deployment (QFD), a methodology involving market and competitive analysis, and 
SDE, the goal was to design a new sports car model that can be competitive and aesthetically cutting-edge. The model 
creation process is divided into several stages that required in-depth knowledge in the use of various programs. Both 
the aesthetics and performance of the vehicle must be perfectly optimized. To top it off, a scaled prototype printed in 
PLA was also made to offer a first impression of the final model to the future customer.

1. Introduction
The definition of ""sports car"" refers to a type of automobile designed to achieve an elevated level of performance, 
typically geared toward a high end of the market (Rentzmann and  Wuthrich, 2019). Sports cars are works of high 
engineering that fall between ""normal"" cars, used as ""everyday"" vehicles, and track racing cars, which prioritize 
performance over functionality (Ingenbleek  and. Lemaire 1988). Thus, designed to give the driver an experience on 
the road or on the track of a high degree of luxury and performance, they have special characteristics: an extreme and 
avant-garde design, with lines with attention to detail and certified beauty; they are often halfway between tradition 
and innovation, giving rise to extremely modern and sophisticated solutions, while also managing to represent the 
history of their car manufacturer at its best; they have a strongly sporty connotation, proven by average performance 
out of the ordinary; they are very original mechanical means, different from the cars usually seen in cities for everyday 
use. The purchase of a sports car requires a well-calculated evaluation given the amounts of money they require (Katz 
and Cain, 2011). So, it was decided to identify what are the advantages and disadvantages in owning one of these 
marvels. The main advantages are those for which these cars are specially designed: Speed, Exclusivity, Driving, 
Safety. However, owning a ""luxury"" car leads to disadvantages, which are often related to its maintenance (Cannon 
and  Rucker, 2019). Price, Parts, Repairs, Insurance, Consumption, Limits, Emissions. As can be seen, most of the 
advantages are associated with the driving experience the car offers, while the disadvantages are mainly associated 
with the costs of buying and maintaining it on the road (Okulicz-Kozaryn et al, 2015). At this point, the choice will 
depend on the preferences of the customer who will have to put all these factors on the scales.

Figure 15. Model ready for painting. 
In order to really see if the work so far was done well, it was decided to give a first coat of sapphire blue spray paint, 
which brings out the curvature of the surfaces and any imperfections to the eye. The windows of the car were covered 
with tape, so that it could be painted later having already the shape well demarcated. 
 
In case the work is already satisfactory, one can proceed with the colouring of the details. In the opposite case, the 
previous steps can be repeated, as happened with the prototype described here (Figure 17).  
 
 
Figure 16. 3D physical prototype completed. 
Once the base coat of sapphire blue paint had been allowed to dry, we moved on to working with a brush for greater 
precision, going on to colour the various details of the car. Taking the renders on V-Red as a reference, an accurate 
job was attempted so as to make the prototype as realistic as possible. The final result is in this case obtained after 
several hours of work, but it offers added potential for the company. In fact, unlike an exclusively virtual prototype, 
this can be delivered directly to the customer, making it more effective to observe details that would not stand out 
from the CAD model alone. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The sports car market is very competitive and staying ahead of the times requires continuous design studies and 
product innovation. For this reason, the design process of a car is of utmost importance and must be executed as 
meticulously as possible in order to bring a product to the market that meets customer demands. The application of 
the IDeS methodology proves to be effective and is already being developed for application in various business 
settings. Its effectiveness stems from the methodical schematization it allows to offer even in the case of the 
development of a complex product such as an automobile. It makes no distinction as to the economics of the company, 
in terms of budget, production capacity or market segment in which it operates. Any business, from small to large,

can exploit the potential of this methodology to follow the development of a product from its conceptualization to 
physical prototyping and commercialization, with very high probability of success.

Abstract 
In this paper we investigate the correlation between Hexaco-100 personality traits and supply chain contracting 
behavior. We consider a simple one-supplier-one-retailer supply chain under linear consumer demand. First the 
supplier determines their price share, then receiving this information, the retailer determines their price share and these 
price shares in total determine the selling price and thus the demand. In this exploratory study we investigate the 
relationship between the aforementioned contracting behavior and the personality traits measured by Hexaco-100 
inventory. Our results show that organization and creativity have significantly positive correlation with supplier price 
share. In terms of retailer decisions, modesty significantly reduces price decisions whereas social-boldness 
significantly increases.

1. Introduction and Literature Review
It has been well-established by plethora of experimental and empirical studies that human decision-makers do not 
conform to the theoretical expectations under complex operations problems. Researchers have been trying to 
understand and remedy this suboptimal behavior for more than 20 years now. Schweitzer and Cachon (2000) first 
showed that there is a too-low-too-high pattern in the newsvendor decisions. That is, under high profit margin subjects 
place too low order decisions and under low profit margin they place too high orders. In a more complex setting where 
there is a second decision maker, the strategic interaction between the decision makers and social preferences also 
keeps the decision-makers from following the theory. Studies such as Keser and Paleologo (2001) have shown that 
decision-makers are not solely concerned with their own profit, they also care about the profit of the other firm and 
they want to share the total supply chain profit equitably or more equitably than the theoretical expectations. To this 
end Keser and Paleologo (2001) show that manufacturers offer lower than optimal prices to the retailers. Loch and 
Wu (2008) show that the salience of the relationship or status within the supply chain can effect how decision-makers 
act and thus the efficiency of the contract.  
There have been some studies trying to address this suboptimal behavior by investigating a connection between 
personal factors. Some of these studies have shown that cognitive skills (Moritz et al. 2013), gender (de Vericourt et 
al. 2013), self-esteem (Akbay 2016), regret tendency (Akbay 2016), emotional stability (Akbay 2022) has effect on 
the order decisions of the subjects.  
This study is closely related to Akbay (2022) as both studies investigate the connection between experiment data and 
Hexaco-100 personality traits. Hexaco-100 (Ashton and Lee 2007) is a very common personality measure that has 
been widely used in research and in human resource management. For instance, Hilbig and Zettler (2009), Hilbig et 
al. (2012), Hilbig et al. (2013) and Hilbig et al. (2014) study the effect of Hexaco personality traits on performance in 
economic games. They show that in ultimatum game, agreeableness subscale is related to the second player accepting 
more unfair offers and honesty/humility facet is related to the first player offering more favorable allocations.  
To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first to consider the effect Hexaco-100 personality inventory in supply 
chain contracting. Hence by exploring the relationship between Hexaco-100 personality traits and supply chain

Table 4 presents the correlation coefficients of the survey results with the retailers’ pricing decisions. Only “modesty” 
has significant correlation, and it is negative. As modesty score of the subjects increase they are expected to react with 
smaller price decisions. Sincerity, greed-avoidance sub scales and honesty-humility facet also have negative 
correlation as expected. All of the sub scales in emotionality facet have negative correlations coefficients. This may 
be explained by as the person becomes more in need to emotional support or more sentimental they respond to 
supplier’s prices more timidly and make smaller price decisions. Conversely social self-esteem, social boldness and 
other scales in extraversion facet lead to increased price decisions.

4. Conclusion  
In this study we explored the connection between Hexaco-100 personality traits and supply chain pricing decisions. 
We have seen that parallel to earlier literature, Honesty- Humility scale leads to suppliers offering smaller prices to 
the retailers. Altruism has a similar effect on supplier decisions, as well. Retailer decisions decrease with Honesty-

Humility. Emotionality leads to both suppliers and retailers make smaller pricing decisions. Due to small sample 
size the findings of the experiment are not significant. Further research with larger sample sizes may reveal more 
significant results. Nonetheless, we believe we have made a key contribution to the literature with this study.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of workforce training and education programmes. 
According to the Global Manufacturing Index, there has been an increase in workforce aging within the manufacturing 
industry, which led to a decline in the high-tech skilled workforce. There is no doubt that the workforce is facing 
challenges of advancing technology, globalization, and demographics to name a few. Equally, these forces are 
challenging institutions, organizations, and industries to respond by supporting the workforce to reskill and upskill 
constantly. As a result, there is a need to focus on articulating the skills, competencies, and capabilities that will be 
necessary in a near future, and to determine the effectiveness and flexibility of workforce training and education 
programmes to establish relevance in a way that addresses life-long learning and work, and that addresses long-term 
unemployment solutions. The findings are based on a recent literature review that focuses on workforce development 
and aligning education and training with industry needs.  These findings suggest that aligning education and workforce 
training with industry needs is a worldwide challenge for both developed and developing economies to invest in human 
capital development, especially with the focus on the manufacturing sector workforce which has been in decline in 
the past few years. The impact on education, skills, and career development forces institutions to reflect on their 
education and training programmes as to whether they should respond to the national mandate. The findings will 
provide some insight to education and training institutions, organizations, industries, workers, students, and job 
seekers of what is underway and what skills will be needed more, as well as on how to build and sustain a skilled 
workforce and economic growth while strengthening career pathways and guiding skills attainment for the nation.

1. Introduction
A nation’s education system has a significant impact on its economic performance and the millennial nature of our 
workforce, who come with their perceptions of a conducive working environment compared to the baby boomers. 
These types of workforces always change their expectations, which are often influenced by globalization through 
social media. There is a notion that millennials come from universities with high expectations, seeking purposeful 
work experience, constant learning and development opportunities, and career progression. If they are underutilized 
and not developed, they leave. Meanwhile, the baby boomers are more concerned about financial necessities and 
health improvement. This has also influenced the way organizations now recruit, manage, and support the workforce. 
The digital era is forcing organizations, industries, and institutions to reposition their strategies to adapt quickly and 
be more agile to address the challenges.  
As a result, there is a need for an appropriate approach to partnership collaboration from all stakeholders to address 
these challenges collectively. It is evident that all industries and economies are lagging behind in workforce innovation 
and development. Yet, the gig economy demands an approach that also aligns education and workforce training with 
industry needs for inclusive economic growth. Thus, this paper explores aligning education and workforce training 
with industry needs worldwide in both developed and developing economies to invest in human capital development, 
with the notion that education and skills development are pivotal for economic growth, yet skills shortages have been

However, over time these old workers find it difficult to adapt, hence their study suggests that senior workers have a 
lower level of innovation. The impact might differ as well per profession and occupation, moreover, there is a notion 
that “the increased penetration of information technologies might place older workers at a disadvantage” (Aiyar et al., 
2016, p. 6). Nonetheless, upskilling and retraining the workforce is required to bridge these gaps. Improving education 
and workforce development can be facilitated through partnerships with different stakeholders/institutions, hence 
some of the skill development programme needs to be customized as per the needs of an organization and its nature. 
Additionally, the call for re-alignment through collaboration will assist economies by “articulating career pathways 
from schools to work, and fostering cross-sector partnerships that oversee state and regional workforce initiatives” 
(Department of Labour, 2020, p.1). This is precisely what this paper advocate to bridge the gaps and build a culture 
of sustainability, which Zaber, Karoly and Whipkey (2019) believe requires new strategies and modification of 
policies in order to address these labor issues. Their findings suggest that there are shortfalls: 
•
“Clear pathways and supports for workers who need retraining
•
Employees struggling to find workers with 21st-century skills
•
The increased risk on some workers because of the changing nature of work
•
The slow Evolution of educational institutions” (Zaber et al., 2019, p.2)
The shortfalls show the lack of systemic support for the teaching and learning of society and the workforce (Hora et 
al., 2016), which is continuing in the 21st century.  
2.3 Justice and Ethical Workplace culture 
The workforce still faces issues of work ethic and ethical workplace culture, which oftentimes tend to affect their 
productivity. The widening gap in income and inequality between rich and poor as well is concerning when it comes 
to workforce development planning. There is a lack of appropriate ethical system(s) in some industries, particularly 
in Africa and South Africa (Nicolaides, 2009).  The findings of this study suggest that the African business 
environment is under scrutiny due to unethical business practices such as self-preservation, narcissistic cultural 
orientations, a sense of entitlement, “have-arrived” syndrome, nepotism, and corruption to name a few. In light of the 
above, the amendments of policies are imperative to address the injustice of unethical practices, which appears as if 
the leaders have no interest in workforce development but rather in their own benefits and self-preservation. Clearly, 
there is a lack of ethical workplace culture that governs the people and holds the leaders accountable. These are the 
factors that are affecting the alignment of education and training of the workforce with industry needs, and 
additionally, the human capital development.  
3. Conclusion and future research
The human capital development and workforce aging is a challenge globally despite all the interventions that other 
economies have been implementing. On the other hand, is digitalization era as well that forcing organizations, 
industries, and institutions to reposition their strategies to adapt quickly while attending to issues of under-over- 
qualified workforce. It is imperative that future research investigate there factors contributing to lack of workforce 
upskilling and retraining. Most importantly, how to bridge the gap of inequality income and the unethical business 
practices. The African business ethical systems require serious attention from the policymakers and the leaderships. 
Hence corruption, bribery, self-preservation hinders social economic development and economic growth.

Abstract 
This research aims to understand the critical success factors (CSF) of Saudi Arabia (SA) in addressing the COVID-19 
pandemic. Moreover, it proposes approaches to decline the bottlenecks of the current process of checking the health 
status in Tawakkalna application (smartphone app help the authorities to check the vaccines status and infected 
people). Three hundred eighty-four responses were collected via an electronic survey representing the population with 
a 5% confidence interval (CI). Data were analyzed to determine participants' agreement and recurrence of the problems 
identified by observing the checkpoints in malls and their opinion about the suggested solution. The results show 
promising indicators as the practitioners express agreement on the bottlenecks identified and the proposed solution. 
In addition, the analysis showed that the participants had an average of 1.62 minutes to pass the checkpoint. Yet, the 
expected average time after implementing the solution is 0.44 minutes. However, the current study did not study the 
effect of the solution on the cost. Future work should investigate examining different facilities.

Introduction
In December 2019, coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China. On 11 February 2020, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) named the disease ""COVID-19"", which is short for coronavirus disease 2019 (WHO Director-
General's Remarks at the Media Briefing on 2019-NCoV on 11 February 2020, n.d.). COVID-19  is a highly infectious 
disease leading to high mortality rates (WHO 2020, Chowdhury et al. 2020)  
The virus is transmitted in different ways, directly or indirectly. It could be transmitted by animals or people carrying 
the virus. COVID-19 has resulted in a continuing pandemic and a massive effect on the whole world economy and 
life, causing numerous countries to lockdown imposing a curfew (Challen et al, 2021, Kiros et al. 2020, Sakurai et al, 
2020, Aburas et al, 2020, Gersons et al, 2022), As far today, more than 364 million cases, approximate 5.6 million 
deaths, and 9.8 billion vaccines are given worldwide; as of 27 of January 2022, the spread of the disease still appears 
challenging to address (Gersons et al. 2020). The virus spreading method makes it dangerous since people are infecting 
each other without even knowing. The pandemic has caused critical global economic damage, the most significant 
global economic collapse since the Great Depression. Therefore, authorities have abnormally executed costly 
interferences to contain the virus, schools and universities were closed, and mosques were also closed (JHU, 2022). 
Citizens have been requested to social distancing, avoid crowds, and stop unneeded activities. Although different 
precautionary measures have been taken to narrow and control the entrance of disease, the first significant cases have 
been reported before the end of February in many countries, including Italy, USA, the UK, and Saudi Arabia (SA).

The researchers recommend removing the duplicated checks, which will reduce the processing time and waiting line. 
In addition to reducing the cost, we either have fewer employees due to eliminating the multiple checks or utilizing 
our staff to deliver better service to the customers. Secondly, we recommend applying and developing the widget tool 
to Tawakkalna since it seems to positively affect the process, which helps have better flow and better overall customer 
experience.   
 
5. Conclusion and Future Research 
All the factors mentioned in this paper are considered essential factors that should be considered in any future 
pandemics or similar circumstances. We believe that the factors mentioned, found, examined, and reviewed in this 
research helped in minimizing the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to the success story of addressing 
the virus in SA. The importance of the factors could also be seen and reflected through the made literature review, as 
shown in table 1. However, some other factors were not mentioned and could have an effect, and the mentioned factors 
are considered the most important ones based on the researcher's literature review. 
    
The C2 factor was examined since the researcher believes it is one of the most critical factors. Yet it needs a longer 
time to show the effect while it is a new approach. Hence, not many papers mentioned this factor. Based on the study 
of (47) Tawakkalna is the most effective app and easy to use among other apps developed by the SA government. 
Therefore, this paper examined many problems and areas of improvement in the app that affect people's daily lives. 
After observing and investigating the current process of examining malls visitors' health status on Tawakkalna, the 
process was found to have two main problems and activities that were considered non-value-added and bottlenecks 
processes. While a survey was used to confirm the data obtained by observing the process, the results showed a 
verification and a clear indicator that the problems were frequently happening and wasting and increasing the 
processing time. Furthermore, the survey results highlighted that the recommendation of applying a widget tool to the 
app is helpful and will make the process faster, less costly, and more efficient.  
 
An in-depth analysis of the effect of applying the solution on the cost should be made in future. In addition, future 
work should consider examining facilities other than malls since the same approach can be used to other facilities to 
have a better flow and a better process while reducing the waste of time and cost.  
 
All the mentioned suggestions could be utilized for different purposes other than Tawakkalna. The first alternative 
can be used to improve any process or event that is crowded; for example, it could be used for checking the tickets for 
football games, events, etc. As for the second alternative could also be utilized for different purposes such as linking 
the driving license with it, linking the national ID, etc.

Abstract 
Power generation, maintenance scheduling, and transmission have been a serious concern in the last few decades 
because of the high increase in power demand. Large electricity producing company is providing electricity to the 
most populated areas through both connected and non-connected power plants (PPs). This research discusses the most 
common issue of overhead power transmission lines in the western region. The main purpose of the study is to reduce 
the high-level power transmission cost by lessening the logistics expenses and by increasing the reliability of the 
power network. This problem is addressed by developing an algebraic framework for connecting different cities to a 
single loop having a minimum length between maintenance centers and setting up an appropriate number of teams. 
Furthermore, research also considers certain constraints for a more consistent and cost-effective transmission 
mechanism. For this purpose, western region cities are selected and the MLIP mechanism is used by feeding the 
MATLOG data for the current study. Research has contributed by proposing a certain number of maintenance centers 
and an appropriate number of teams by deploying an algorithmic solution for the data analysis and results. The study 
found some constraints that need to be further investigated in future studies for more reliable results.

1. Introduction
Power generation, maintenance scheduling, and consistent transmission is a very technical processes in nature. These 
three processes must be addressed professionally to provide the reliable and stable possible power services. This study 
particularly focuses on power transmission using overhead cable lines connected through towers. This process always 
needs a certain type of maintenance on regular basis as per the recommended schedule. The entire process cost is high 
and one of the main factors is logistics cost. Technical maintenance teams visit each tower one by one for inspecting 
the tower components and joints connected with overhead cables and submit a report to the immediate reporting office. 
This paper particularly addresses the issues of overhead transmission lines mechanism to make the power supply 
process consistent and most importantly cost-effective. One of the leading power generation companies in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia provides power services. For this research western region, cities are selected as a pilot 
project. Electricity Company is providing regular electricity to the most populated areas in the western region through 
both connected and non-connected power plants (PPs).  
The researcher has thoroughly investigated the entire power transmission process and visited some areas of the western 
region for collecting data from the concerned officials/technicians and other supporting staff. The researcher found 
that logistics cost is very high and it could be reduced by adopting certain important measures. For this purpose, 
following arrangements have been suggested to determine the minimum possible logistic cost referenced with each 
maintenance task. 
2. Research Aim and Objectives
In view of the research domain, being in nature of operations management, cut down in logistic cost is the main aim 
of this study. Secondly, reducing the logistics cost is main objective of the study to ensure that reduction of logistic

The main purpose of the study was to reduce the logistics cost by improving the power transmission in the western 
region of Saudi Arabia. The study has collected important data on city coordinates and deployed the most suitable and 
appropriate methods like MLIP and MATLOG as a tool for digging out important results. Study results have proved 
that reducing the logistics cost without affecting sustainable power transmission is cost-effective support to the power 
producer. Study results have recommended a minimum of six control centers, which can efficiently perform the 
maintenance as per the network demand in a given time. Secondly, a minimum number of teams as per the proposed 
solution methodology are going to be the same for every center. In other words, the problem is solved to divide the 
workload by the given number of centers equally. This process will help the management to perform an algebraic 
algorithm according to any specific labor constraints at any later stage to determine the number of teams and number 
of people in each team etc. The Total logistic cost here is proportional to the distances covered by each team in each 
control center. This process can be economic and cost-effective if it is deployed as per the research recommendations.

Abstract 
In the U.S. public transit ridership in 2020 declined by 79% compared to 2019 levels at the start of the pandemic. With 
lockdowns implemented during the early days of the pandemic, direct human-to-human interactions migrated to 
virtual platforms. This study investigates the public’s perception of transit systems via a social media analysis, given 
the advent of vaccines and other COVID-19 preventive measures. We developed a structured topic modeling tweet 
analytics (Twilytics) framework to analyze public discourse data (i.e., tweets from 2020 to 2021) on the impact of 
COVID-19 on transit systems. The framework has four main components: first, we extracted the tweets starting from 
June 2020 to November 2021. Second, we pre-processed and cleaned the data. Third, we performed statistical analysis 
on the cleaned data. Lastly, we performed topic modeling (TM) using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach to reduce 
the dimensionality of our textual data and uncover the prominent themes of the public’s perception of transit systems 
during the pandemic. We extracted 44,320 tweets related to public transit in the US within the study period. On 
average, 2020 had 113 transit-related tweets per month, while 2021 had 59.81. In addition, categorizing the tweets 
resulted in four main themes: transit and social distancing, travel bans, airlines, and vaccinations. Kruskal-Wallis’s 
analysis of variance test results showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the number of transit-related

Abstract 
In the current era of globalization, tourism is a familiar thing throughout the world—one of the cities in Indonesia is 
quite famous for its tourism to foreign countries in Bali. Hotel Risata Bali Resort & Spa Tuban Bali also took 
advantage of this opportunity to attract tourists to stay at the hotel by implementing a green marketing strategy and 
hotel atmosphere to attract the hotel. This research is survey research, while the research sample is 99 visitors to Hotel 
Risata Bali Resort & Spa Tuban Bali. Data collection techniques are using questionnaires and documentation 
techniques. This study shows that the green marketing strategy carried out by visitors to the Risata Bali Resort & Spa 
Tuban Bali Hotel influences buying interest. Meanwhile, Hotel Atmosphere does not affect purchase interest. In 
structure II, Green Marketing and Hotel Atmosphere have an impact on purchasing decisions. Only buying stake does 
not influence purchasing decisions at the Risata Bali Resort & Spa Tuban Bali Hotel.

Green Marketing, Hotel Atmosphere, Buying Interest, and Purchasing Decisions 
1. Introduction
In the current era of globalization, tourists are increasingly selective in choosing accommodation based on the level 
of awareness of tourists. It is also supported by education, knowledge, and culture. They tend to select accommodation 
that utilizes energy-efficient resources and is based on green hotels, which consistently apply environmentally 
friendly. With the increasing awareness of tourists, it is not surprising that many hotel accommodation businesses are 
competing to apply the green hotel concept; this indicates that hotel accommodation competition is increasing. One 
of the strategies used by the hotel industry players regarding facing this competition is to implement a green marketing 
strategy.

target consumers to influence customer buying interest. Mathur and Goswami (2014) stated that if a well-designed 
atmosphere is to be a differentiator in the face of competition, this differentiating factor can attract customers’ buying 
interest. 
 
The data that has been analyzed shows that the green marketing variable influences purchasing decisions. This finding 
has implications for hotels or similar business actors to improve the concept of green marketing in their business to 
encourage purchasing decisions further than their customer’s target. This is like what Sumarwan (2011) stated if three 
aspects influence the way customers make purchasing decisions, namely marketing strategies, individual differences, 
and environmental elements. 
 
The data that has been analyzed shows the hotel atmosphere influences purchasing decisions. This finding has 
implications for hotels or similar business actors to continuously improve the comfort and atmosphere of a hotel to 
encourage customers to make purchasing decisions. The hotel atmosphere in question is related to area design 
activities through visual communication, colour, light, music and smell that can trigger the perception of customers 
who come to influence their decision to make a purchase. This is also like the statement by Mathur and Goswami 
(2014) that an attractive atmosphere will encourage customers to make purchases. 
 
The data that has been analyzed shows that purchase intention does not influence purchasing decisions. The study 
results are like the findings by Hauf (2014) that buying interest does not affect purchasing decisions. The author’s 
conclusions have implications for hotels where this research will understand the strategy undertaken by Hotel Risata 
Bali Resort & Spa has not increased customer buying interest, which impacts purchasing decisions. So, this research 
urges business actors to innovate again with more strategies innovative so that customer buying stakes can increase 
and influence purchasing decisions. 
 
The data analyzed shows no effect of green marketing influencing purchasing decisions through customer buying 
interest. This means that customers in making purchases even without the aspect of buying stake, customers can make 
purchasing decisions because of the green marketing aspect carried out by customers of Hotel Risata Bali Resort & 
Spa. This finding is like the results by Kusuma et al. (2017), where buying interest is proven not to be an intervening 
variable in mediating the relationship between green marketing and purchasing decisions. With this result, it is hoped 
that it can encourage these parties to consider other marketing strategies so that further customer buying interest can 
positively influence aspects that are applied by hotels or other businesses. 
 
The data analyzed shows that there is no influence of hotel atmosphere on purchasing decisions through customer 
buying interest. The results of this study are in line with research conducted by Yanti and Budiatmo (2020) that is not 
proven to be an intervening variable in mediating the relationship between hotel atmosphere and purchasing decisions. 
If observed from the direct effect, buying interest has no impact on purchasing decisions and the hotel atmosphere 
variable, which does not influence the decision. There is no direct influence of buying interest on buying decisions as 
an initial indication if customer buying interest at Risata Bali Resort & Spa does not significantly affect purchasing 
decisions and the natural result of the hotel atmosphere. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the research results, it can be concluded that green marketing and hotel atmosphere do not affect purchasing 
decisions through the customer buying interest at the Risata Bali Resort & Spa Tuban Bali Hotel. Thus, to improve 
purchasing decisions through customer buying interest, consistency is needed to understand customers that all 
activities carried out regarding green marketing and those carried out are genuinely implemented and friendly to the 
environment. In addition. the importance of the hotel atmosphere or the atmosphere of the domain. It is the image of 
a hotel in the minds of customers. When a good idea of a hotel already exists in customers’ minds, it will indirectly 
create buying interest, influencing customers in making a purchase decision. 
 
6.1 Suggestion 
Based on the discussion raised in the previous section, in detail, positive suggestions can be made for developing 
understanding or practical needs. The results show that the green price is part of green marketing at Risata Bali Resort 
& Spa Hotel. Does the primary focus that customer expect to be re-evaluated? This illustrates that most customers 
think that the price offered by Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotel is not comparable to the facilities and benefits. That can 
be felt related to the green marketing program or green hotel offered. Therefore, the Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotel 
1553","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

needs to re-evaluate the green price aspect to improve consumer purchasing decisions. In addition, offering prices that 
are competitive with competing hotels but, on the other hand, will provide benefits for customers with the green hotel 
concept that is carried out, will be able to increase customer interest and purchase decisions. The research results show 
that the general interior, which is part of the Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotel’s hotel atmosphere, is the primary focus 
that customer expect to be re-evaluated, both in terms of exterior, furniture, and the cleanliness of the hotel area, which 
is expected to meet expectations. Customer. This needs to be done to give a good impression in customers’ minds, 
which is expected to attract customers to stay or make purchases related to the products and services offered at the 
Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotel. 
The results showed that the customer’s buying interest related to exploration interest was relatively low due to the 
customer’s perception of the lack of information about Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotel. Therefore, the Risata Bali 
Resort & Spa Hotel needs to re-evaluate aspects that can increase customer exploration interest. Such as building a 
good image and reputation and maximizing supporting facilities to make it easier for customers to find information 
about Risata Bali. Resort & Spa Hotels. Building a good idea and reputation and providing convenience in finding 
information about Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotels will increase customer exploration interest based on customer 
curiosity about Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotels. When customer exploration interest increases, it is expected to 
increase customer purchasing decisions.

1. Introduction
Currently, the world attaches great importance to technological capabilities, management, and human resources to 
compete in the era of economic globalization. Companies capable of this must continue to hone their abilities, always 
create new things, and create effective costs so that they are not swallowed up and left behind by so many competitors. 
The unification of the country becomes more integrated due to economic globalization making a country bigger. this 
can impact national boundaries that quickly fade due to new patterns and dimensions that appear so identical. and 
create a narrowing of space and time so that the world becomes without borderless/borderless. This becomes a

Based on the study results, it was found that organizational culture significantly influences performance through work 
capability; this means that the State Civil Apparatus will perform well and have an excellent organizational culture 
and is supported by good work skills. This can be seen from the results of the path analysis in Table 4. 
Based on empirical facts in the field and the results obtained from the analysis of this study, it can be said that at the 
Department of Community and Village Empowerment of South Sulawesi Province, organizational culture can 
improve the performance of the state civil apparatus with high indicator values. The existence of a culture of tolerance

backgrounds. And in the process of carrying out the work carried out besides that. The clarity of the has been well

capability; this means that the State Civil Apparatus will perform well and have good time management and is 
supported by good work skills. This can be seen from the results of the path analysis in Table 4. Based on the research 
results, it is proven that the time management indicator has a high answer/score from the respondents' answers. This 
indicates that the state civil apparatus and agencies, in general, have set targets or made work plans, which are to be 
carried out, divided into short-term and long-term goals. This is stated in the work plan and achievements carried out 
by the Community and Village Empowerment Office of South Sulawesi Province. After the goals are set, then 
determine the time to be divided into each of these goals. This includes work plans for daily goals as well as long-
term goals. This is by the theory put forward by Douglass in Timpe (2002), explaining that most of us don't think 
about goals. We react or respond to pressure from other people or circumstances. If you want to control the time in 
your own life, then you must set goals. Other people can't do it for you, and because we tend to find what we're looking 
for, it's essential to set the right personal goals (Aswar 2021; Nurjayanti 2021). 
The Department of Community and Village Empowerment of South Sulawesi Province always determines priorities 
in a job to foster the responsibility of its employees for the work. They are doing so that the work carried out is also 
always carried out with time efficiency and with the targets that have been set can be carried out correctly. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of the analysis and discussion that has been started, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
Organizational Culture has a significant effect on work capability, meaning that the better the Organizational Culture 
owned by ASN, the work capability will also increase; Time management has a significant effect on work capability, 
meaning that the better time management applied by ASN, the more work capability will also increase; Organizational 
Culture has a significant effect on ASN performance, meaning that the better the Organizational Culture owned by 
ASN, the performance will also increase; Time management has a significant effect on ASN performance, meaning 
that the better time management applied by ASN, the ASN performance will also increase; Work capability has a 
significant effect on ASN performance, meaning that the better the work capability applied by ASN, the ASN 
performance will also increase; Organizational culture has a significant effect on performance through work 
capabilities; this means that the State Civil Apparatus will perform well and have an excellent organizational culture 
supported by good work skills; Time management has a significant effect on performance through work capabilities; 
it can be concluded that the State Civil Apparatus will perform well and have good time management and is supported 
by good work skills.

1. Introduction
In motivating organizational work units to be effective and efficient, personnel management must motivate 
administrative work units to achieve company goals. Personnel management seeks to focus on how management 
acquires, hires, develop and retains employees in a relevant and humane manner to accomplish this goal. Personnel 
management research focuses on how management obtains, uses, develops, and maintains employees appropriately 
and humanely (Arfan 2021; Anwar 2021). 
In addition to developing employee capabilities and skills, resource development also aims to achieve individual and 
company development to discover and unleash the hidden potential of their employees. These resource development 
activities can be carried out by motivating and encouraging employee confidence, developing an excellent corporate 
culture, conducting education and training, career development or promotion to achieve company performance.

performance of PT Saptasaritama Makassard is influenced by the attitude of discipline and motivation in the 
environment of PT Saptasaritama Makassar. It is PT Saptasaritama Makassar which has low field and work motivation. 
 
Motivation is more of a hoax than a science. This is because what is needed in its implementation can influence and 
persuade employees who will get motivated. When employees practise discipline, the employee's work motivation 
will indirectly increase, which will affect the employee's performance. One possible way to increase employee 
motivation is to give rewards to employees who have performed well and achieved the targets set by the leadership or 
superiors. Meanwhile, employees who take disciplinary action can be punished with heavier penalties so that 
employees are afraid to violate the rules and do not repeat them. Therefore, it is hoped that this method can create and 
improve the performance of PT Saptasaritama Makassar employees. 
 
Companies need an adequate business system and need a good or excellent work system to produce a good 
performance for their employees and help the company achieve company goals to achieve company targets. This 
aligns (Setiawan), which states that work discipline and motivation to work together significantly affect employee 
performance. 
 
Good employee motivation will encourage employees to return to work with enthusiasm, and the results achieved are 
also good. With reasonable work discipline and optimal motivation, PT Saptasaritama Makassar will compete with 
other companies and become a better company than in previous years. This research is also relevant with the title 
Effect of World Discipline, words, and projects where discipline affects performance through motivation. 
 
The results of the seventh hypothesis test show that employee performance is strongly influenced by the motivation 
for promotion at PT Saptasaritama Makassar. This indicates that the better the rise of a job, the greater the work 
motivation of employees, which will affect employee performance. 
 
Job promotion is a means that can encourage employees to be better or more motivated to carry out tasks within the 
organization. The existence of promotions in companies, in general, is to motivate employees to improve their work 
performance. Performance rewards are usually written with promotions. Employees perceive promotion as the best 
thing compared to other salaries. This is because promotional offers are permanent and valid for an extended period 
and improve employee performance when promotions are offered. The term promotion means advancement because 
promotion can occur when an employee is promoted from a low position to a higher position. Generally, promotion 
is followed by an increase in income and other facilities. Increasing pay and responsibilities usually involve promotion. 
 
The results of this study are in line (Riyadi), which emphasizes that promotion has a positive effect on employee 
performance. In contrast case study, which underlines that advertising has no significant impact on employee 
performance. 
 
6. Conclucion 
Based on this research, the results obtained: 1) work discipline has a positive and significant effect on motivation, 2) 
job promotion has a positive and significant effect on motivation, 3) work discipline has a positive and significant 
effect on employee performance, 4) work promotion has a positive and significant effect on employees performance, 
5) motivation has a positive and significant effect on employee performance, 6) work discipline has a positive and 
significant effect on employee performance with motivation, and 7) job promotion has a positive and significant effect 
on employee performance through motivation at PT Saptasaritama Makassar.

Abstract 
This study examines and analyses the effect of education and financial ability on elderly care through health services 
in Durikumba Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju Regency. This research design uses a 
quantitative approach with survey research design and path analysis, namely determining the direct and indirect effect 
of the variables to be studied. The population in this study were all families who have or care for older people aged 
60 years to 75 years and over as many as 273 populations recorded as caring for the elderly in Durikumba Public 
Health Center’s working area Karossa District, Central Mamuju Regency. The number of samples in this study using 
accidental sampling where the determination of the model using the Slovin formula with a tolerable error rate of 
0.05%, the number of pieces in this study were 162 respondents. The results showed that the financial ability of elderly 
care did not have a significant effect. In contrast, education on elderly care through health services had a positive and 
significant effect, and education and economic capacity for health services had a positive and significant effect.

1. Introduction
Globally, the population aged over 60 years in 2014 was 12% of the total global population (UNFPA, 2015). In 
Indonesia, the problem of elderly care is significant to note. The first reason is that the number of older adults has 
increased significantly during the last forty years, by the increase in the number of older adults in 1970 by 5 million 
to 18 million in 2010. This number is projected to increase to more than 71 million in 2050 (UI Demographic Institute 
and HelpAge International, 2012). There are five problems faced by the elderly (Coordinating Ministry for Human 
Development and Culture, 2017), namely economic, psychological, social, physical, and psychological problems. BPS

their work, so they do not have time to take care of the elderly or are even left alone by a family. That makes older 
adults not live. Potential and become displaced. This condition causes families to choose institutional services to take 
care of the elderly. One of the services for elderly institutions is social care. 
 
Based on the path analysis test (Path Analysis), the path coefficient of model II is obtained that the direct effect of X1 
on Y2 is 0.220. At the same time. The indirect effect of X1 through Y1 on Y2 is the multiplication of the beta value 
of X1 to Y1. The beta value of Y1 to Y2: 0.445 x 0.684 = 0.304. Then the total effect given by X1 on Y2 is the direct 
effect plus the indirect effect, namely: 0.220 + 0.304 = 0.524. Based on the calculation results above, it is known that 
the value of the direct effect is 0.220. The indirect effect is 0.304, which means that the value of the indirect effect is 
greater than with direct effect value. To test the hypothesis is done by using the Sobel test, guided by the t-table, which 
is 1,654, and the t-count from the Sobel test is 3,548. This shows that t-count> t-table or 3,548 <1,654, so it can be 
concluded. The sixth hypothesis states, “Education has a positive and significant effect on elderly care through health 
services in the Durikumba Community Health Center Work Area, Karossa District, Central Mamuju Regency,” is 
accepted or proven. 
 
This is evidenced by the high perceptions of the respondents on the education variable, which shows that the 
knowledge possessed by families with a pretty good educational background must foster, increase, and develop the 
potential of the elderly. The complete health services that the elderly can get and feel cannot be separated from good 
family education in understanding and providing care for the elderly. With a sound and maximum education, a person 
will think broadly about good health services provided to the elderly who need care—the higher a person’s education 
level, the better the ability to understand and reason information. 
 
The Effect of Economic Ability on Elderly Care Through Health Services in the Work Area of Durikumba Health 
Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju Regency; Based on the path analysis test (Path Analysis), the path 
coefficient of model II obtained a direct effect given by X2 to Y2 of 0.066. At the same time, the indirect effect of X2 
through Y1 on Y2 is the multiplication of the beta value of X2 to Y1. The beta value of Y1 to Y2: 0.357 x 0.684 = 
0.244. Then the total effect given by X2 to Y2 is the direct effect plus the indirect effect, namely: 0.066 + 0.244 = 
0.31. Based on the results of the above calculations, it is known that the value of the direct effect is 0.066 and the 
indirect effect is 0.244, which means that the value of the indirect effect is greater than the value of the direct effect. 
To test the hypothesis was carried out by using the Sobel test, guided by the t-table, which was 1.654, and the t-count 
obtained from the Sobel test was 2.710. This indicates that t-count> t-table or 2.710> 1.654.  it can be concluded that. 
The seventh hypothesis, “Economic Ability has a Positive and Significant Effect on Elderly Care through Health 
Services in the Work Area of Durikumba Public Health Center, Karossa District, Central Mamuju Regency,” is 
accepted or proven. 
 
The high perceptions evidence of respondents on the variable of financial ability in the third indicator shows that 
families with sufficient economic ability are expected to pay attention to the basic needs of the elderly.  (Nutrition for 
the elderly. Bathing, BAK, and defecating. Moving from a bed to sitting, traveling.  etc.) are in the pretty good category 
with an average value of 4.21. Maximum ability or economic capacity in a family will significantly affect the health 
services provided for elderly care.

Abstract 
The results showed that professionalism, competence, and training positively and significantly affected employee 
performance. This study proves and accepts a positive and significant influence between competency professionalism 
on employee performance, which is mediated by education and training variables within the Makassar Class I 
Correctional Center. This means that it shows that the more professionalism, competence, and education and training 
within the Makassar Class I Correctional Center are improved with the policy components carried out by 
organizational leaders, the higher the performance that employees can produce. Because in principle, the leadership 
policies implemented by an organization are structured to improve the performance of their employees and then impact 
organizational performance because employees are the most vital resource that will determine the organization's 
success in the organization's goals work program.

1. Introduction
The Makassar Class I Prison Center carries out the primary duties and functions of the Ministry of Law and Human 
Rights in Community Development and Prevention to provide instructions and reduce children from the community 
by applicable legal provisions. The Makassar Penitentiary is part of the integrated criminal justice system. Its duties 
and functions mainly refer to other law enforcement officers, such as the police, prosecutors, courts, State Rutan, and 
correctional institutions. The task of the Makassar Class Correctional Center is to carry out community development 
and child labour by applicable laws and regulations. Meanwhile, the Makassar Class I Penitentiary also conducts 
community research for judicial materials, registering correctional clients, and implementing community guidelines 
and child abortion (Lakip 2019). 
The state civil apparatus (ASN) must work well, work professionally and with integrity, and work responsibly in a 
measured and responsible manner Sedarmaianti (2010) explains that professionalism is a turning point that makes the 
bureaucracy aspect an efficient machine, especially for the government, and more importantly, to measure the ability

5. Discussion
The results of the first hypothesis test show that professionalism has a positive and significant effect on education and 
training, which shows a coefficient value (p1) of 0.195; the value is 2.057> the t-table is 1.987 significance value 
0.043. This means that if the professionalism of the Makassar Class II Correctional Institution employees is increased, 
the employee training will also increase; otherwise, if the Makassar Class Correctional Institution employees 
deteriorate, the education and training obtained by employees will also decrease. This research supports previous 
research conducted by Suharman (2019), Zana Riska (2019), and Yuan Angkoso (2015). The results showed that there 
was a positive and significant influence between professionalism on education and training. 
The results of testing the third hypothesis indicate that professionalism has a positive and significant effect on 
employee performance as indicated by the coefficient value (p3) of 0.197; No. 3.200> from 1.987 with a value of 
0.002. This means that if the professionalism in the organization is exemplary. The performance of employees in the 
Makassar Class Correction Center will increase; on the contrary, if the professionalism in the organization is not 
exemplary, the performance of employees will also decrease. Research that supports the above opinion includes 
research conducted by John Henry Siberian (2014), Yuan Angkoso (2015), and Zana Rizka (2019). This study shows 
that there is a positive and significant influence between competence on employee performance. 
The results of the fourth hypothesis test indicate that innovation has a positive and significant effect on performance 
which shows a coefficient value of 0.455; No. 6.507> t-table 1.987, and the significance value of 0.000 is smaller than 
the 0.05 significance value. This means that if the competence of employees within the Makassar Class II Correctional 
Center is good, then employee performance will increase; otherwise, if employee competence is not good, then 
employee performance will also decrease (Rachman et al. 2019; Sam et al. 2019; Suharyanto et al. 2021; Yusuf et al. 
2019). This research is supported by discussions held by Mujiati and Son (2016), Aji et al. (2017), and Hariianto, 
Nasaruddin and Munir (2018). This study shows that there is a positive and significant influence between competence 
on employee performance. 
The results of the fifth hypothesis test indicate that education and training (Training) has a positive and significant 
effect on performance which shows a coefficient value of 0.391; the number 5.653> the number 1.987, and the value 
is 0.000. This means that if the education and training of my employees are getting better, then the employee's 
performance will increase; on the contrary, if the education and training of employees are not good, then the 
performance of employees will also decrease. One way that can be done to improve employee performance is 
employee development, namely the implementation of education and training (Ambar  and Rosidah, 2003). 
Testing the seventh hypothesis shows that competence has a significant positive effect on employee performance 
mediated. The employee training variable at the Makassar Class II Workshop, as indicated by a coefficient value of 
0.202; No. 3.932> t-table 1.987, is also a p-value or a significance value of 0.000, which is less than 0.050. This means 
that education and training must play a role in providing a significant positive impact on mediating the impact of 
competence on employee performance in the Makassar Class II Correctional Institution. The results of this study are 
strengthened by previous research conducted by Febriianti (2013), Prasetio and Ida (2017) that competence is the skill 
and willingness to carry out a task effectively. The better the education and training that employee receive, the more 
competencies they will have, and the effect shown by employees. 
6. Conclusion
Meditation and training cannot strongly influence professionalism and competence on employee performance at the 
Makassar Class II Workshop. However, the results of this study prove and accept that there is a positive and significant 
influence between professional competence on the performance of education and training (Diklat) employees in the 
Makassar Class II Penitentiary. This means that the more professionalism, competence and education, and training in 
the Makassar Class II Penitentiary and the policy components implemented by the organization's leadership, the 
employee's performance will increase. Because in principle, the leadership guidelines applied by an organization are

designed to improve employee performance, then impact organizational performance, because employees are the most 
critical resource. It is a vital factor that determines the organization's success in the goals of the organization's work 
program.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine and analyze training and incentives on employee performance through work productivity 
at the Public Health Centre (PHC or PHC) in Bissapu Sub-district, Bantaeng Regency. This research was conducted 
at the PHC in Bissapu Sub-district, Bissappu Health Center and Campagaloe Health Center. This research design is a 
survey with a quantitative approach. The population in this study were all employees, State Civil Apparatus (ASN) 
and Non-ASN at the PHC in Bissapu Sub-district, Bantaeng Regency, with 115 employees. The sampling technique 
is total sampling by involving all members of the population as a sample. Data were collected through observation, 
interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, while data analysis used path analysis. The results show that training 
and incentives can improve performance directly and indirectly through work productivity. What is different in this 
study is to separate productivity and performance, that not all productive employees show good performance, but good 
performing employees will undoubtedly be productive at work.

1. Introduction
Health is one of the essential elements of the quality of life and national development to realize Indonesia. PHC are at 
the primary level in health organizations where health workers work together to achieve health development goals 
(Sulaeman, 2009). 
As an essential resource for both hospitals and health centers, health center employees or health workers need to be 
continuously developed to create productivity and performance in carrying out their duties and responsibilities; many 
factors can encourage increased productivity. 
Training is an instrument in developing apparatus resources or improving the quality of the apparatus in increasing 
knowledge, expertise, skills, and attitudes to carry out professional duties. According to Manullang (2011), training

skilled the employee is at work, and skilled employees certainly provide good work results such as the work being 
done to be of high quality. Able to do a better job without feeling pressured and even raises a commitment between 
himself and his organization. 
 
The results of this study are supported by (Bahari et al., 2019; Sintoso and Heryenzus, 2021; Wawo et al., 2018; 
Zulkarnaen and Suwarna, 2017), who conclude that there is a positive and significant effect of incentives on 
performance. Incentives as a form of appreciation given by the organization for achievements in work, and incentives 
can trigger better work results. The better the incentives provided will encourage the improvement of the employee's 
performance. 
 
The results of this study are supported by (Andriani et al., 2020; Bahri, 2016; Michaelis et al., 2015; Zulkarnaen and 
Suwarna, 2017), who conclude that there is a positive and significant effect of work productivity on performance. 
Work productivity is the maximum utilization of potential to achieve the best results from a job. Employees with a 
good level of productivity will lead to increased performance, higher quality work output and can be completed by 
the specified time. 
 
Training is an essential aspect in developing organizational resources, through practical training will make employees 
more proficient at work so that they become productive in their work and performance can be improved. 
 
Incentives are a stimulus to encourage employees to work better; incentives also mean an award given by the 
organization to achieve the employee's performance. The better incentives received by employees should be able to 
increase their productivity and have an impact on improving their performance. But sometimes, not everyone can 
judge well the incentives provided. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results and discussion, it can be concluded that training and incentives can improve performance directly 
and indirectly through work productivity. What is different in this study is to separate productivity and performance, 
that not all productive employees show good performance, but good performing employees will undoubtedly be 
productive at work.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine and elaborate on how much influence psychological capital has on performance through 
the work capability and soft competence of sub-district employees in the Jeneponto Regency. This research was 
conducted in Jeneponto Regency, which lasted for approximately 2 (two) from October to November 2020. This study 
used a causal (causal) design with a quantitative approach. The population in this study were all sub-district employees 
in 3 sub-districts in Jeneponto Regency, namely Tamalatea Sub-district, West Bangkala, and Binamu in Jeneponto 
Regency as many as 150 employees. The sampling technique used saturated sampling, where all population members 
were used as research samples, namely 150 employees. Data collection techniques through observation, interviews, 
questionnaires, and documentation, while data analysis by path analysis. The results showed that psychological capital 
encourages sub-district employees in Jeneponto Regency to do something that is their hope continuously as the 
primary capital, which tends to be reactive. In this study, the effect with the highest value is shown in the influence of 
psychological capital on work capability and soft competence. Psychological capital as an asset owned by the Sub-
district office in Jeneponto Regency, this asset must be fostered and maintained. The psychological capital of Sub-
district employees in Jeneponto Regency has encouraged employee capabilities to be better. On the indirect effect of 
psychological capital on performance, work capability and soft competence become variables that can moderate the 
relationship of psychological capital on performance. This research contributes to the lack of research on 
psychological capital concerning employee performance and contributes to knowledge that employee performance is 
related to physical ability to work. More importantly, reactions can drive employee performance—emotions from 
within. This research is different from this research because it tries to separate psychological capital and soft 
competence by seeing psychological capital as an abstract mental reaction. In contrast, smooth competence is a 
reaction that is manifested in concrete actions.

The Effect of Psychological Capital on the Work Capability of Village Employees in Jeneponto Regency. Positive 
and significant. They were supported by research (Supriatna 2016). Psychological capital reflects employees who have 
a good character at work; employees with adequate psychological capital tend to continually improve themselves, not 
only improving their character at work but encouraging work capabilities to be better. 
The Effect of Psychological Capital on the Soft Competence of Village Employees in Jeneponto Regency. Positive 
and significant. Supported by research (Bimaria 2016). The psychological model as the primary capital possessed by 
employees is shown by a high optimism and hope and allows them to survive in different conditions. This potential 
has formed attitudes and personalities for those with better individual abilities in communicating or interacting. 
The Effect of Psychological Capital on the Performance of Village Employees in Jeneponto Regency. Positive and 
significant. They were supported by research (Wijayanthi et al, 2019). Employees show the psychological model of 
Sub-district employees in Jeneponto Regency. Who is more punctual in completing their tasks and responsibilities, 
getting better work results, taking advantage of the potential to reduce costs that can be incurred, and their optimism 
that the work can be completed correctly? 
The Effect of Work Capability on the Performance of Village Employees in Jeneponto Regency. Positive and 
significant. They were supported by research (Wahyuni et al, 2019). The high ability of employees to carry out 
activities by what is assigned to them, with their capabilities, has encouraged increased performance, higher quality 
work results, and of course, become a great asset for the organization to be fostered and maintained. 
The Influence of Soft Competence on the Performance of Village Employees in Jeneponto Regency. Positive and 
significant. They were supported by research (Idriati). The role of soft competence is a determinant of employees' 
success in their work, with their soft competencies that have facilitated interaction and are open in all things to achieve 
common goals. The role of soft competence can encourage the achievement of good work results individually and in 
groups. 
The Influence of Psychological Capital on Performance Through the Work Capability of Village Employees in 
Jeneponto Regency. Positive and significant. Not all the employees in Jeneponto Regency have the same view of 
psychological capital. Some of them show performance that is not in line with the organization's expectations. 
Employees who lack confidence in their work demand more help from coworkers to solve their problems so that they 
are not productive even though they have good work capabilities. 
The Effect of Psychological Capital on Performance Through Soft Competence of Village Employees in Jeneponto 
Regency. Positive and significant. Most of the employees in Jeneponto Regency have shown their potential with good 
psychological capital; employees with high hopes and optimism can control themselves, so they are more proficient 
in good interaction/communication, open with anyone and anyone so on. In addition, most of the Sub-district 
employees in Jeneponto Regency also show their sincerity to maintain and maintain their organization; they are more 
sensitive to various changes and show a positive attitude towards whatever happens in the organization. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the study results, it can be concluded that the effect with the highest value is shown in the influence of 
psychological capital on work capability and soft competence. Psychological capital as an asset owned by the Sub-
district office in Jeneponto Regency must continue to be fostered and maintained as an asset. The result is that what 
is currently provided has also contributed well by increasing work capabilities soft competencies. The psychological 
capital of Sub-district employees in Jeneponto Regency has encouraged better employee capabilities (technical, 
humanist, and conceptual). It has also increased employee confidence with an open attitude and good communication 
skills. On the indirect effect of psychological capital on performance, work capability and soft competence become 
variables that can moderate the relationship of psychological capital on performance. This research is different from 
this research because it tries to separate psychological capital and soft competence by seeing psychological capital as 
an abstract mental reaction. In contrast, soft competence is a reaction that is manifested in concrete actions.

Abstract 
This study analyses the effect of exercise habits and a low-salt diet on the quality of life of hypertensive patients by 
mediating blood pressure control variables in the group of participants with hypertension proteins at the Technical 
Implementation Unit (UPT) Public Health Centre (Puskesmas) Galesong in Takalar Regency. Primary data collection 
was done by using observation, interview, and questionnaire/questionnaire techniques. The research sample was 144 
people. The research was using a quantitative approach. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS 23 with path 
analyses 1 and 2. This requirement was carried out to determine the correlation between the independent variables, 
namely exercise habits (X1) and low salt diet (X2), on the quality of life of hypertensive patients (Y2), which was 
mediated by the blood pressure control variable (Y1). The results of this study indicate that 1) exercise habits have a 
positive and significant effect of 36.6% on blood pressure control, 2) a low-salt diet has a positive and significant 
effect of 62.6% on blood pressure control, 3) Exercise habits have a positive and significant effect of 33,9% on the 
quality of life of patients with hypertension, 4) A low-salt diet has a positive and significant effect of 27.1% on the 
quality of life of patients with hypertension, 5) Blood pressure control has a positive and significant effect of 38.3% 
on the quality of life of patients with hypertension, 6) Exercise habits have a positive and significant effect of 1.4% 
on the quality of life of patients with hypertension through controlling blood pressure, and 7) A low-salt diet has a 
positive and significant effect by 2.4% of the quality of life of patients with hypertension through blood pressure 
control.

5. Discussions 
There are systems in the body that try to maintain stable blood pressure in the long term by preventing sudden changes 
in blood pressure due to circulatory disorders. The blood pressure system is very complex controlled. Initial control 
begins through the nervous system, namely cardiovascular reflexes, chemoreceptor reflexes, ischemia responses, CNS 
(central nervous system) originating from the atria, and smooth muscle of the pulmonary arteries. The hormones 
vasopressin and angiotensin control fluid movement in the capillary and cavity circulations in the next phase. Finally, 
the control of blood pressure stability will be continued by a potent and long-lasting system that regulates the number 
of body fluids with various organs. In primary hypertension, the increase in blood pressure is caused by changes in 
cell membranes and kidneys, the activity of the sympathetic nerves, and the renin-angiotensin system (a role in 
hemodynamics, sodium intake, and sodium metabolism in the kidneys), and endothelial factors. 
 
Control of hypertension and prevention of coronary heart disease can be done by changing the risk factors, namely: 
1. Lose excess weight / overcome obesity; 2. Reduce salt intake in the body; 3. Create a relaxed state; 4. Doing regular 
exercise; 5. Quit smoking; and 6. Reduce alcohol consumption. 
 
Hypertension management aims to get a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mmHg and less than 130/80 mmHg for 
diabetes mellitus and kidney failure. Reducing cardiovascular mortality and preventing complications of kidney 
disease are also goals for treating hypertension. Management can be done through non-pharmacological therapy (with 
lifestyle modifications) and pharmacological therapy. (http://intissarisainsmedis.weebly.com/) 
 
Exercise is safe enough for people with hypertension. However, you should still use blood pressure-lowering drugs 
from a doctor before starting a blood pressure-lowering program with exercise training in hypertension sufferers with 
blood pressure more than 180/110 mm Hg. However, the medical condition of people with hypertension is different 
from that of healthy people. Therefore, it is necessary to exercise that is also explicitly done. Exercises that are done 
must be gradual and should not be forced. Exercise is done with light intensity slowly according to ability. 
 
The quality of a person's life can be measured from various aspects of human life. One of them is the WHO designed 
the manufacture of an instrument for measuring the quality of human life, which we knew as the World Health 
Organization Quality of Life 100 (WHOQOL-100), where the World Health Organization Quality of Life Life-BREF 
(WHOQOL-BREF) is a simpler version. This instrument measures the quality of human life in terms of several aspects 
such as physical, psychological, social, and environmental relationships. This instrument has been used widely, 
including. To assess the quality of—the life of a person suffering from certain diseases (WHO, 2012). 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research and discussion in the previous chapter related to exercise habits, low-salt diet, blood 
pressure control, and quality of life of people with hypertension, the following conclusions can be drawn: Exercise 
habits positively affect blood pressure control by 36.6%; A low-salt diet has a positive effect on blood pressure control 
by 62.6%; Exercise habits positively affect the quality of life of hypertensive patients by 33.9%; A low-salt diet has a 
positive effect; The quality of life of hypertensive patients is 27.1%; Blood pressure control has a positive effect on 
the quality of life of hypertensive patients by 38.3%; Exercise habits have an indirect positive effect on the quality of 
life of hypertensive patients through blood pressure control of 1.4%; In comparison, the total effect is 1.4%. It is 
35.3%, and a low-salt diet positively affects patients' quality of life with hypertension by controlling blood pressure 
by 2.4%, while the total effect is 29.5%.

Abstract 
This study aimed to determine and analyze the effect of Training and Development on Performance through 
Professionalism and Hard Skill Competence for the Civil service police Unit (Satpol PP) in Jeneponto Regency. This 
research was carried out at the Jeneponto Regency Satpol PP Office, which lasted for approximately 2 (two) months, 
namely October to November 2020. This study used a causality (cause-and-effect) design with a quantitative approach. 
The population in this study were all employees of the Satpol PP Office in Jeneponto Regency, namely 180 people. 
The sampling technique used saturated sampling, where all population members were used as research samples, 
namely 180 people. Data collection techniques through observation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, 
while data analysis by path analysis. The results show that the variable with the highest path coefficient value is 
training and development of work professionalism and complex skill competence. Training and development for the 
Satpol PP Office in Jeneponto Regency are considered to improve employees' work professionalism and complex skill 
competence. Through this training and development, the employees' competence in hard skills is also increasing. They 
are indicated by the better technical skills, knowledge, and mastery of employee technology. On the indirect effect, 
the variables of work professionalism and complex skill competence as intervening variables can moderate the training 
and knowledge variables. The two intervening variables that also directly influence performance indicate that the 
variables of work professionalism and complex skill competence can also directly affect the performance of the Satpol 
PP Office in Jeneponto Regency employees. Indirectly, the relationship between variables through moderating 
variables does not show such a significant influence because employees who participate in training and development 
and produce increased professionalism and hard-skill competencies are sure to create a good performance. The results 
of this study contribute to the lack of references that explain how well-managed training and development can make 
a good performance.

Abstract 
21st-century language learning involves technology as a medium of learning. Over the centuries, various 
technologies have been created to synchronize the language learning process to the present-day phenomenon 
that results in flexibility - students can learn a language anywhere, anytime even without a teacher. As the 
newest information technology, smartphones have now functioned as mini-computers that are used by 
students for language learning.  It promotes autonomous learning, that is the ability to control one’s learning 
and the potential ability to act in learning situations.  This research aims to investigate the potential of 
smartphones in promoting autonomous language learning, focusing on three questions; (1) what smartphone 
applications are used by students for language learning, (2) what skills are associated with it, and (3) how 
they use them for language learning. An interview and smartphone log were used to collect the data. The 
findings showed that there are 51 applications used by the participants. Those applications are used for 
different purposes in language learning. 
Keywords  
Smartphone, Language Learning, and Learning autonomy. 
1. Introduction
The development of technology leads to the development of every aspect of life. The traditional ways of life 
change into digital or modern ways. One aspect that changes is education. The teaching and learning process 
is impacted by the advancements of technology (Fatimah and Santiana, 2017; Stosic: 2015). For example, the 
use of media in the teaching and learning process changes from paper-based to virtual and digital such as 
slides of PowerPoint, mp3 player to any computer-assisted learning (Fatimah, et. al, 2019). Besides, it also 
impacts students' and teachers’ attitudes in using technology for teaching and learning activities. As Raja and 
Nagasubramani (2018) stated that nowadays modern students prefer to use technology for their learning 
because it provides an interactive learning atmosphere and promotes autonomy. In short, being able to use 
technology for the teaching and learning process can lead to successful teaching and learning language. 
Many technological tools have been created from time to time. Such tools continue to be invented to assist the 
teaching and learning process (Raja and Nagasubramani, 2018). In the teaching and learning process, 
computers are one of the technological tools used for a long period of time. Throughout the time, the design 
of computers has become more portable and handier such as laptop, iPad, or even the smallest computer 
pocket called a smartphone. Smartphone provides lots of applications that can be downloaded free or paid. 
There are two common operating systems used in a smartphone; they are iOS and Android. Both systems 
provide the same facility. People can easily download applications such as social media, chatting sites, online 
games, online dictionaries, Google as the biggest search engine, music player, video player, etc. 
As one of the newest technologies, a smartphone is easily accepted by people even nowadays, it becomes 
their daily companion. Besides, it functions as a communication device; smartphone provides an application 
found in the computer. In short, people have a mini-computer in their pocket; they can make a call, text, 
email, read an e-book, listen to music, and so on (Bllaca, Nuhi: 2016; Kacetl, Klimova, and Blanka: 2019). In

Students take charge of their learning means that the language learning process is without coercion. The log 
shows that students consciously know what they have to learn by choosing the learning language activity of 
their own will.  This relates to what Benson (1997) stated that the significant characteristics of autonomous 
learning are: (1) consciously learn on their own, (2) having the responsibility of what they learn, (3) 
consciously know and be responsible for the process and the content of learning.  
 
Ramamuruthy and Rao (2014) summarized the advantages of smartphones for learning; personalized and 
informal learning, the smartphone provides participants to design, create, and decide the way they learn. The 
result shows that it gives them enjoyment in learning language activities. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Smartphones use for language learning is widely used by most people, even it has become a daily routine for 
students. Besides functioning as a communication tool, smartphones can now be used as a tool in learning 
English. Through smartphones, students can access applications that can be used in learning English 
wherever and whenever they want, both in the classroom context and outside the classroom. Without 
realizing it, they have become autonomous learners when using smartphones to learn English. The 
smartphone is a tool to make it easier for them to learn English the way they want. Thus, it can be concluded 
that smartphones can be used as a means of autonomous English learning, therefore, Smartphone-Assisted 
Language Learning is a breakthrough for the autonomy of learning English.

Abstract 
The development of Buddhism in Indonesia a marked by various traditions. Each sect has different cultures and 
traditions in interpreting Buddhism. This study aims to determine the value plurality of Buddhism in Vesak 
celebrations at Borobudur and Sewu temples. This study uses a qualitative method of naturalistic inquiry 
approach. The result of this research is that  (a) Walubi held a Waisak celebration at Borobudur Temple. Walubi 
members from the Theravada, Mahayana, and Tantrayana traditions set up booths for the puja room according to 
their respective a tradition. The puja room is use for the puja ceremony before Vesak seconds. Besides, there is 
the main puja room at Borobudur Temple use jointly during Vesak seconds. (b) The Indonesian Buddhayana 
family organizes Vesak celebrations at the Sewu Temple. Waisak in Sewu Temple only has one puja room. Vesak 
rituals use the Theravada, Mahayana, and Tantrayana traditions. (c) Vesak celebrations at Borobudur and Sewu 
temples show that Buddhism that developed in Indonesia has variety of cultures. The plurality value of Vesak in 
Borobudur Temple emphasizes mutual respect for cultural differences plurality of Vesak in Sewu Temple is fused, 
complementary, and an emphasizes the equality of the Theravada, Mahayana, and Tantrayana traditions. The 
pluralization of Vesak in Borobudur and Sewu Temples is the implementation of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, a symbol 
of the unity of the Indonesian nation

1. Introduction
Buddhism is a religion that originated in India. The word' Buddhism implies devotion to 'Buddha' means 'the 
Enlightened One' Buddhism believes that there were Buddhas in the past and future, but many contexts, it more 
frequently those known in history as Gautama for Theravada Buddhists and Sakyamuni for Mahayana people. 
Gautama Buddha or Sakyamuni Buddha was born into a royal family that ruled the Sakya tribe in Kapilavastu 
around 460 BC. Kapilavastu is currently known as Nepal. In 623 BC the ascetic Gautama became a Buddha and 
taught his teachings during his lifetime. Buddha does not refer to a unique individual figure but focuses on 
Buddhism. Buddhism helps individuals develop compassion, avoiding the illusions that cause attachment to cause 
suffering. Buddhism is called Dharma or Dhamma. Buddhism flourished throughout Asia, the northern part of the 
Mahayana school and the south developed the Theravada school. Indonesia influenced by both, namely Mahayana 
and Theravada (Athyal 2015). 
The Buddhist teachings summarized in the Tri Pitaka have recorded and translated into many languages, especially 
Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan (Groves et al. 1994). It indicates that Buddhism spread to various 
parts of the world. The revival of Buddhism driven by the high level of thinking about understanding Buddhism, 
not based on blind dogmas and revelation but on rational thought and experience (Baumann 2001), Buddha 
Gautama as the founder of Buddhism (Dharma), gave freedom to his students to teach according to local culture 
and customs. It makes Buddhism consists of various schools or sects, each of which has different traditions. In 
general, Buddhism is divide into three kinds, namely Theravada, Mahayana, and Tantrayana. The three schools 
have their respective interpretations in interpreting Buddhism. 
The plurality of Buddhism in Indonesia has been researched by Nalanda, entitled Buddhism and Religious 
Tolerance in Indonesia. The results of the research show that Buddhism promotes mutual respect, harmony, and 
peace. Various Buddhist organizations developed in Indonesia that coexisted with sects. It is following the state

lies in the variety of the puja room as the Theravada tradition is identical to the Sakyamuni Buddha, the Mahayana 
tradition, besides Sakyamuni Buddha, which is identic to the symbols of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas. The Japanese 
Buddhist tradition uses the Gonzhon symbol, and the Tantrayana tradition uses the Guru, Buddha, and Bodhisattva 
symbols. Various Buddhist religious assemblies from the Theravada, Mahayana, and Tantrayana schools in 
Indonesia live side by side, respect each other, tolerate, and live in harmony with other religions. Through the 
ideology of Pancasila and the slogan Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, Indonesians, including Buddhists, are guaranteed to 
worship according to their respective beliefs (Nalanda 2014). 
 
The value of the plurality of Vesak in Borobudur Temple emphasizes mutual respect for various Buddhist cultures 
that have developed. Each of them upholds the attitude of religious tolerance. The value of peace is see in the 
Vesak celebration at Borobudur Temple. The value of plurality in Waisak Candi Sewu is to view cultural 
differences as a unity that complements each other in understanding the core of Buddhist teachings. It conveyed 
by Sudhamek that pluralism in the view of Buddhayana means that one's inner life was various. The differences 
are beautiful and complement or complement each other. The notion of pluralism emphasizes vigilance regarding 
a view is shrouded in dualism, where spiritual understanding is still at the relative truth level, so that it is still 
heavily influenced by each other's perceptions. Besides that absolute, truth is beyond the reach of human language 
(Sudhamek 2012). Based on this, The Vesak of Borobudur Temple and Sewu Temple of plurality values are built-
in control sectarian ego. The plurality value built can be described as follows in Figure 2. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. The Value of Vesak Plurality of Borobudur Temple and Sewu Temple 
 
This condition indicates that all Buddhists who celebrate Vesak at Borobudur Temple and Sewu Temple respect 
Buddhist culture. The difference between Waisak in Sewu Temple and Borobudur Temple lies in the reciting 
paritta, sutra, and mantra. Buddhist rituals such as meditation, mantras, mudras, and prayers are performed by 
Buddhists can help achieve the perfection of life and be a blessing to oneself and others (Rokib 2019). The 
plurality of religions and the harmony of Buddhism are inseparable unity. It can see from the respectful attitude 
towards other Buddhist communities who jointly celebrate Vesak, both at Borobudur Temple and at Sewu Temple. 
The attitudes as Buddhists' Vesak worship behavior is proof that Buddhists in Indonesia uphold a non-imposing 
attitude towards a sect. Buddhists are give the freedom to choose Buddhist assemblies according to their 
conscience, although various traditions developed in Indonesia, in essence, one Buddhist teaching. The plurality 
of Buddhism is the cultural wealth of Indonesia, Buddhists mutually aware of the different rituals between sects. 
Understanding pluralism can help increase the trues understanding of religion both in the logic of teachings in the 
holy book and the application to the social environment. Buddhist leaders appealed to their followers to celebrate 
Vesak according to their traditions, both at Borobudur Temple and at Sewu Temple. The leaders also could not 
prohibit their followers from celebrating Vesak anywhere. An attitude of tolerance embedded in the soul of 
Buddhists is the identity of Indonesian society. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The plurality of Buddhism in Indonesia can see during Vesak celebrations at Borobudur and Sewu temples. Each 
Buddhist community respects and respects differences in culture and rituals. Vesak at Borobudur Temple was

attended by various assemblies from the Theravada, Mahayana, and Tantrayana schools were members of the 
Walubi. It shows that the level of tolerance towards religious life in Indonesia is very high. Each of them can 
control himself against the sectarian ego. Likewise, the Vesak celebration at Sewu Temple was organized by the 
Indonesian Buddhayana Family. Sewu Temple Vesak has a characteristic that the Waisak ritual by reciting paritta, 
sutra, and mantra is followed by all participants. The value of the plurality of Vesak in Borobudur temple 
emphasizes peace, mutual respect for cultures and upholds values of internal religious tolerance. While, the 
plurality value in Sewu Temple emphasizes complementary and perfecting attitudes. The Theravada, Mahayana, 
and Tantrayana traditions constitute one Dhamma of Buddhism. The plurality of Vesak in Sewu Temple and 
Borobudur Temple is evidence of Buddhist tolerance in Indonesia which the application of Bhinneka Tunggal 
Ika.

Abstract 
In this paper, although photovoltaic power generation has recently shown the most remarkable growth in the field of 
renewable energy worldwide, defects may occur if power outages or manufacturing facilities remain despite the 
increase in demand and demand for photovoltaic power generation. A machine learning algorithm that predicts the 
optimal development to solve these problems was obtained through experiments. By implementing the algorithm in 
the system, it will be able to contribute to reducing operating costs and popularizing it. Neural network, SVM, and 
deep learning are used as prediction algorithms, and the optimal algorithm is selected by using the root mean square 
error (RMSE), which is the most used when identifying prediction errors. We propose a predictive model whose 
prediction rate is expanded by changing the algorithm structure and modifying constants. Then, a defect detection 
system is developed by applying the predicted results to the domestic regional data.

1. Introduction
The annual growth rate of photovoltaic power generation from 2000 to 2014 is the fastest growing field among power 
generation technologies. Solar power is increasing worldwide. In particular, it showed the most remarkable growth in 
the renewable energy sector. Despite the increasing demand and need for photovoltaic power generation, there are 
problems such as difficulty in constructing technology and power generation facilities, and a lack of related manpower. 
In particular, workers are currently identifying defects caused by due diligence due to panel defects such as climate 
change, dust, and other foreign substances, and power outages and equipment due to lack of manpower are also being 
neglected. Due to its characteristics, solar power generation varies greatly depending on climate conditions, and the 
need for an automatic panel defect detection system is emerging because it is impossible to predict power generation 
with single data such as temperature, charge, and solar radiation. In order to build a system, accurate predictive 
research on solar power must be preceded. In this paper, six variables were selected for solar power generation 
prediction: solar radiation, solar radiation, precipitation, cloud, fog, and fog (yellow dust). By collecting climate data, 
a power prediction algorithm was selected using solar power information sharing and regional data comparison. Neural 
networks, SVMs, and deep learning are used as prediction algorithms. When selecting an algorithm, we selected the 
optimal algorithm using the mean square root error (RMSE), which is most commonly used to identify prediction 
errors.(Takefuji, 2012; Harrington, 2012; REN21, 2011) 
2. Body
Internationally, the annual growth rate of photovoltaic power generation between 2000 and 2014 is increasing the 
fastest among power generation technologies. Solar power generation worldwide increased from 4 GW in 2004 to 177 
GW in 2014. It has increased by 30GW in 2011, 38GW in 2012, and 39GW in 2013, showing more remarkable growth 
in recent years. When analyzing the top 10 countries by country in Table 1, the United States, China, and Japan show 
the largest growth. The spread of supply due to new facilities for solar power generation is interpreted as a result of a 
decrease in the cost of solar power generation. Solar power generation costs have continued to decline over the past 
30 years, with a 19.3% learning experience or learning ratio (Figure 1): Every time the capacity doubles, the price 
falls by 19.3%.

Using the learned results, a data storage server for a web-based photovoltaic defect detection system is configured as 
shown in Figure 2. Climate data is requested daily to form a database and plant data is changed in real-time, so data 
is parsed and stored at 1-minute intervals.  
 
Figure 3 shows the implementation completion screen of the solar power defect detection system. Power generation 
information for each inverter and module is configured to be monitored on the screen in real-time, and the power 
generation forecast is displayed as a value using climate data and power generation data from the Korea 
Meteorological Administration in the prediction algorithm.

3. Conclusion 
Due to their nature, photovoltaic power plants have many difficulties in early identification in the event of defects. To 
detect defects, the amount of power generation was predicted and the defect was determined through comparison with 
the actual measured amount of power generation. To select the optimal prediction algorithm, climate data and power 
generation data were normalized and applied to SVM, neural networks, and deep learning. As a result of using the 
RMSE value as an evaluation method of the algorithm, deep learning showed the best prediction rate. To apply this 
to domestic data, 280 days of data were obtained from the National Climate Data Center and the Jeju Botari Power 
Plant and used as learning data. The solar power defect detection system can contribute to the decline and 
popularization of solar power plants in Korea by predicting power generation using learned deep learning algorithms 
and determining defects using panel data.

Abstract 
In a variety of manufacturing enterprises, there are still many tasks such as manual assembly that need to be processed 
by hand, it is as important as ever to improve workers performance. Motivation is also a powerful energy that drives 
and excites workers, which results in their maximum performance. In order to improve workers’ performance, some 
factories have applied social comparison theory to prompt workers to compete against each other so as to raise 
workers’ motivation toward assembly tasks. As there is a lack of researches on the effect of social comparison on 
workers’ performance for assembly tasks, we have designed a laboratory experiment of cell production to investigate 
the effect of social comparison. We have built a structural equation model to clarify the psychological mechanism that 
the workers’ personality traits, mediated by their social comparison orientations, affect their response to the downward 
social comparison, and consequently have a significant influence on the workers’ motivation and performance. It is 
clear that the development of burnout or stress caused by the downward comparison has a negative impact on the 
workers’ performance.  
In this study we give a detailed examination on how did the workers feel toward the downward comparison. We 
designed a questionnaire, which has eight items and is conducted after the experiment. We carried out a correlation 
analysis between the workers’ feeling and their personality traits as well as social comparison orientations, and then 
conducted a cluster analysis of the workers based on their feeling toward downward social comparison. We intend to 
making the following contributions through these investigations: 
(1)
As there is a lack of study to consider how did the workers feel toward the downward comparison, this study
aims at filling this gap through conducting a questionnaire and providing detailed investigating results to clarify
the individual difference in the feeling toward the downward comparison.
(2)
Instead of explaining the psychological mechanism that personality traits affect the social comparison process,
and consequently influence individual’s motivation and job performance, this study places our emphasis on
figuring out how many workers feel uneasy or stressed about the downward social comparison, and how many
workers didn’t respond to the downward social comparison.
(3)
Although many companies have applied the social comparison theory to motivate the workers for improving
their performance, almost all of the companies conduct social comparisons according to the supervisors’
experiences or intuitions. This paper intends to provide some key points for practitioners to conduct social
comparisons more effectively.

1. Introduction
Recently, convergence and complex research of state-of-the-art innovative technologies have been actively promoted 
in various academic fields around the world. Innovations developed through such convergence and complex research 
are bringing about disruptive innovation across all industries, and there is a huge wind of change throughout the 
industry, with the emergence of completely new business models. This change is also the core foundation of the 4th 
Industrial Revolution, which has recently become a hot topic. In other words, the 4th Industrial Revolution can also 
be seen as the emergence of an ""age of convergence complex technologies"" that overcome challenges in social and 
scientific technology as new levels of technology that did not exist were developed.  
Since the confrontation between Lee Se-dol and AlphaGo in March 2016, the public's awareness of AI has increased, 
and policy interest in the fourth industrial revolution is also very high after the presidential election in May following 
the government's announcement of comprehensive measures for the intelligent information society in 2017.(Choi and 
Oh, 2017).  
To lead the future health care industry, the government has identified six core projects as ① establishment of a 
healthcare big data showcase, ② establishment of an ecosystem for the healthcare industry, ③ establishment of a 
smart clinical trial center, ④ development of new drugs using artificial intelligence, ⑤ smart convergence, complex 
medical care Device development and system improvement, and ⑥ promotion of in vitro diagnostic device market 
entry are selected and discussed.(Healthcare Special Commitee, 2018). 
The government is working on six key projects to lead the future healthcare industry. The medical community is 
actively promoting various convergence and complex projects such as the establishment of a next-generation hospital 
information system and HIS, which integrates and manages all information generated in hospitals such as clinical, 
medical services, and hospital administration using artificial intelligence technology and big data.(Heo, 2017). 
Seoul Samsung Hospital, which is leading the field of precision medicine, introduced the next-generation HIS, 
Digitalized Analysis & Research Window for Integrated Knowledge in 2016, and Seoul Asan Hospital operated the 
next-generation HIS, Asian Medical Information System 3.0, in 2017.(Shin et al., 2018).

It is steadily increasing, and the CAGR from 1979 to 2018 was 14%. As a result of analyzing the word cloud for the 
top 100 words of allocation probability to identify the main keywords related to research topic 3, Sensor, monitoring, 
Real-Time, Body Area Network (BAN), and safety showed high majorities. To analyze research topic 3 in more depth, 
the ego network was analyzed for sensors with high central centrality (0.6162) and mediating centrality 
(0.1255).(Figure 6). The analysis shows that the Sensor is not connected to safety and that it is closely connected to 
Smart Phones, Accelerometers, the Internet of Things (IoT), Failure, and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using 
sensor network technology to conduct personalized health care studies.(Kim, 2017; Rodrigues et al., 2018). 
 
As a result of the analysis, the Sensor appeared as a graph fully connected with the top 4 words with high allocation 
probability, but it was not connected with safety. It can be seen that personalized health care research is in progress 
through real-time monitoring using sensor network technology. 
MaKinsey predicts that the market size of research topic 3 will have an economic effect of more than USD 170 billion 
by 2020 due to the reduction of medical costs, improvement of the quality of life of chronic patients, and health 
monitoring for disease prevention according to research topic 3, MarketAND The market is predicted to be worth 
$163.2 billion (Rodrigues et al., 2018). Major global companies related to research topic 3 include IBM, Microsoft, 
Philips, Cisco, Cerner, Apple, and DeepMindHealth.(Rodrigues et al., 2018).

3. Conclusion 
The purpose of this study is to analyze major research topics and research trends in the era of artificial intelligence 
and healthcare convergence and to systematically understand the changes in the complex field to see the future 
direction of interdisciplinary convergence and complex research. To this end, the results of text analysis, frequency 
analysis by era, topic modeling, 2-mode network, word cloud, and ego network analysis for English thesis abstracts 
published by Scopus for about 55 years from 1963 to 2018 are as follows.  
 
First, as a result of frequency analysis by era, research related to Expert Systems and Knowledge-Based Systems 
(KBM) was active before 2000, but interest has decreased since 2000. Interest in research related to Decision Support 
Systems (DSS) after 1990, Machine Learning (ML), segmentation, and Medical Images after 2000, and Prediction 
and Support Vector Machine (SVM) after 2010.

The analysis results of this paper show that there have been significant changes in research topics in artificial 
intelligence, healthcare convergence, and complex fields by era. Second, as a result of topic modeling analysis, it was 
possible to identify three major research topics in this field and research keywords for each research topic. 
Among the three main research topics, 'AI for Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and 'AI for Medical Image' 
had the highest share of 17%, followed by 'The Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) (15%), 'Big Data Analytics in 
Healthcare (14%)', and 'Medical Robotics (13%), Healthcare (12BM)'. 
As a result of analyzing seven major research topics by era, 'Research Trend Analysis by Text-Mining Techniques on 
the Convergence Studies of AI and Healthcare Technologies' in the 2000s showed that interest among researchers has 
increased significantly since 2010. 
Third, to understand the research contents of the three major research topics, an ego network analysis was conducted 
focusing on the keywords with the highest connection-centeredness and mediation-centeredness. Analysis Results 
Research topic 1 is a study related to medical diagnosis decision support and technology acceptance based on clinical 
information, Research topic 2 is a study related to various medical image analyses and augmented reality, and Research 
topic 3 is a study related to personalized health management using sensor network technology. 
The implications of this study are as follows. 
First, this study is of academic significance in that it was possible to systematically grasp the global research trends 
in artificial intelligence, healthcare convergence, and complex fields, which are bringing great changes to the 
healthcare field through text analysis, topic modeling, and ego network analysis. 
Second, the three main research topics derived from this study are key research topics in the healthcare field that are 
rapidly innovating and growing with the development of artificial intelligence technology. 
According to Accenture, a global consulting firm, the application of artificial intelligence technology is expected to 
grow at an annual rate of 40% by 2021, and PwC, a 2016 global accounting consulting firm, surveyed 12,000 
consumers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and found they are ready to use healthcare services that incorporate 
the Fourth Industrial Revolution technology.(Choi, 2018). 
It is of academic and practical significance in that it has drawn three major research topics in the complex industry, 
healthcare convergence closely related to artificial intelligence technology, which is growing and developing rapidly. 
Finally, the results of this study can be used as basic data for setting future research directions or establishing the 
government's healthcare R&D policy direction and strategy by systematically examining research trends in this field. 
In the future, it is expected that more meaningful implications can be derived by comparing and analyzing trends in 
domestic and overseas paper data, patent data, and news data of research topics derived in this research.

Abstract 
There are circumstances in which patients require immediate medical care. Usually, hospitals have a specialized unit 
ready to take care of emergencies such as: strokes, heart attacks, sepsis, severe wounds, and other medical 
conditions that are also classifies as emergencies. This research compared models based on artificial neural networks 
(ANN) to predict the diagnosis of patients received at the emergency department (ED) of a public hospital. The 
research was carried out following a classic 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. 
During the analysis, patient records collected by ED personnel during 2020 were thoroughly reviewed and 
preprocessed. During the design, some of the records were selected and divided into several subsets following 
specific criteria. Each subset was a set of independent variables used as input to build a prediction model. Technical 
considerations relate to the artificial neural networks (ANN) such as the number of hidden layers and the number of 
epochs, batch size, size of the training and test set, and size of the validation dataset were also defined at these point. 
The phases of construction and the validation are carried out entirely using the WEKA 3.9.6. Numerous 
experiments, trial and error adjustments, and replications were necessary to produce the results shown in this article.  
For the purposes is the present work around 15,000 records were considered. The complete dataset was divided in 
two parts: 80% for training and test, and the remaining 20% for validation. The approach to predict the patient 
diagnose considered the construction of ANNs with of independent variables. During the construction several 
configurations of ANNs were tried to achieve better results. Only the records allocated for training and test dataset is 
used during the construction. The performance of the proposed models was measured in terms of the rate of correct 
predictions made with records allocated for validation. The experimental result revealed that, depending on the 
number of diagnoses, the values of the target class, the proposed models were able to predict correctly between 55% 
and 85% of the cases. In conclusion, ANN-based models can help predict ED patients’ diagnosis with a reasonable 
degree of certainty. However, the success of the model depends greatly on the numbers of values that the target class 
has.

1. Introduction
Either in public hospitals or in private clinics, urgent care services are a fundamental pillar of the health system. 
Emergency departments (ED) have to be prepared and equipped to receive patients who required urgent medical 
treatments that are usually complex and unscheduled. To satisfy a rather unpredictable flux of incoming patients, an 
ED have to count with enough supplies, medical staff, and infrastructure. 
Being able to deliver an adequate medical care when it is needed is crucial to save lives and to complete the 
recovery of a patient. In Chile, considering the size of the population there is a relatively high number cases that 
require urgent care every year. Some studies have shown almost 1,100 annual cases per 1,000 population. Even 
more, regular care cases are also numerous, being in the order of 19 million per year (Santelices and Santelices, 
2017). A study by the Organization for Economic Collaboration and Development (OECD) established that Chile 
was among the countries with the highest annual rate of urgent care cases reaching up to 571 cases per 1,000 
population. The average of OECD countries is 308 cases per 1,000 population (Berchet et al, 2015).

6. Conclusion 
Data collected during 2020 allowed researchers to have a valuable insight of daily operations at an ED. The 
application of adequate tools and techniques helped obtain valuable information than can be used support the 
decision making and to improve the management of the existing resources. 
 
Data preprocessing and the initial analysis revealed that a significant number of the ED records were associated to a 
rather small number of all possible diagnose. In fact, during 2020, the five most recurrent diagnose covered almost 
14% of all ED records.    
 
ANN-based prediction models offer and interesting alternative to support management tasks such as planning and 
scheduling. Although counting with a rather large dataset, the models proposed in this investigation intended to 
minimize the use of data and processing time. Therefore, only a fraction of ED database was used. In total, only six 
attributes were considered to predict patient diagnose. The transformation of the attribute Reason for visit from a 
string to a vector of words supplied extra pieces of information by means of creating additional attributes that helped 
construct more complex models.  
 
When working with machine learning algorithms, instead of simply holding out part of the data it is advisable to 
apply a cross-validation scheme to minimize the influence of the dataset split up. Averaging several results is better 
than having only one result. Furthermore, running replications helped reduce the bias caused by the fold partitioning. 
Besides that, having a set of unknown data only for validation helped confirming whether the models could 
generalize properly or not.  
 
Experimental work confirmed that those models with a smaller set of target class values produced higher correct 
prediction rates. For example, with five class values the correct prediction rate was over 80%. In contrast, with 20 
class values the rate was barely over 50%. 
 
Another interesting fact is the consistency in the experimental results obtained when applying a cross-validation 
scheme, a validation set with unknown data, and a battery of replications. In particular, the predictions made with 
unknown data proved that at least the model with 5 class values was able to generalize well.  
 
Finally, correct prediction rates and confusion matrices suggested that the ANN-based models with 5 and 10 class 
values can predict ED patient diagnose with reasonably good results.

Abstract 
Generally, hospitals and health centers have a specialized area called Intensive Care Unit (ICU) aimed to provide 
treatment for people who are extremely ill. An ICU is staffed with highly trained professionals who operate advance 
equipment. Patients are referred to ICUs when they have a condition that cannot be treated in a regular hospital 
room. For example: after being in a serious car accident, after having a heart attack or stroke, when suffering a 
serious infection such as pneumonia, or after having major surgery. The present research focusses in the 
development of prediction models based on machine learning algorithms to help planning and allocating medical 
staff at an ICU. The research was carried out following a classic 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, 
development, and validation. In the analysis, independent variables such as patient’s age, gender, reason for visit, 
and arrival mode are identified. Data are then pre-processed and prepared for the following phases. Specialize 
software packages for data mining and machine learning were selected for the investigation. Most of the 
investigation’s activities were planned at this point. During the design, different subsets of the independent variables 
were selected to be build prediction models. The size of the training and test set as well as the size of the validation 
set were also defined here. The phases of development and validation were carried out entirely using the software 
WEKA 3.9.6. By means of executing a battery of experiment and “trial and error” adjustments the prediction models 
were completed. To accomplish the goals of this research, thousands of records collected from a public hospital 
were considered. The dataset was divided in a part for training and test (80%) and another part for validation (20%). 
The approach to predict the medical specialty require for the arriving patients considered the development of models 
based on artificial neural networks and decision trees. In all cases, instead of a simple hold-out, a 10-fold cross-
validation scheme was applied. Results showed that, in general, prediction models with fewer classes generate 
higher rates of correct predictions and, therefore, they can be more useful when planning and allocating medical 
staff at an ICU. Even though correct prediction rates fluctuate significantly from one model to another, between 80% 
and 83%, some of the proposed models are reliable.  In conclusion, results showed that prediction models based on 
machine learning algorithms can help planning and managing the need for professionals and support staff at ICU. 
The research might help understand the benefits of using machine learning in hospitals and health centers.

1. Introduction
According to human resources management theories, employees are commonly referred as the main asset of an 
organization. Based on that premise, it is essential to have an efficient, friendly and sustainable management of such 
valuable asset to allow organizations grow up steadily and to endure through time. In healthcare organizations such 
as a hospital and clinics, a timely and appropriate management of medical staff, medical supplies, and infrastructure 
is essential. Patients’ life depends on that. In particular, since medical specialist, nurses, paramedics, and assistants 
are in contact with patients, they are responsible for delivering a proper treatment, medicines and usually for taking 
care during the whole recovery process. However, human resources are also limited. This leads to the need for 
establishing methods to reach the highest healthcare standards within certain constrains. 
The management of knowledge related to organizational processes and its role in the generation of new knowledge 
that can be used to identify key resources, to improve processes, to implement more sophisticated planning tools, 
and to improve customer satisfaction (Hamidi et al., 2016), emphasizes the importance of counting with enough

The preprocessing of data during the phase of analysis along with the initial analysis revealed that an important 
percentage of the records were associated to a few number of medical specialties. ICU 2020 database showed that 
four specialties concentrated up to 80% of all patient records.  
   
Prediction models based on machine learning algorithms are interesting and innovative tool to support the decision 
making process. Specially during the planning and scheduling. Although counting with almost 75,000 records, the 
proposed prediction models minimized the requirements of data and the processing time to necessary produce 
results. Therefore, only a fraction of the database was used during the investigation. In total, only eight fields per 
record were considered to predict the target class Medical specialty. The transformation of the field Reason for visit 
from a string to a vector of words provided more pieces of information by means of creating additional attributes to 
build larger models.  
 
When working with machine learning algorithms, it is a common practice to apply cross-validation schemes to 
minimize the influence of the dataset split up, instead of simply holding out a fraction of the dataset. Averaging 
several results is expected to better than having only one result. Furthermore, running replications help reduce the 
bias caused by the fold partitioning. Besides that, having a collection of unknown data only for validation help 
confirming whether the models can generalize properly or not.  
 
The experiments carried out confirmed that models having fewer target class values produced systematically better 
correct prediction rates. For example, with four class values corresponding to the top four medical specialties, the 
correct prediction rate was over 80%. In contrast, with 15 class values the correct prediction rate was close to 55%. 
It is worthwhile to mention the consistency of the experimental results when applying a cross-validation scheme, a 
validation dataset with unknown records, and a battery of 10 replications. The predictions made with unknown data 
proved that at least the proposed model M-04 was able to generalize well.  
 
Finally, correct prediction ratios and confusion matrices confirm that the approach presented in this work can be 
useful tool to estimate staffing needs and to support decisions making when allocating specialists at an ICU.

Abstract 
Either a high complexity hospital or a smaller clinic, healthcare centers have to withstand the constant pressure of 
the incoming flow of new patients. While some patients require a simple medical procedure, others will need further 
examination and probably have remain in observation for some time. This situation is particularly complicated in 
times of sanitary crisis. Since the infrastructure, supplies, and medical staff are limited resources, there is a real need 
for utilizing them efficiently. This research is focused on the use of ensemble machine learning algorithms to 
develop models for predicting the destination of patients who are discharge after a stay at an intensive care unit 
(ICU). The investigation was carried out following a 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and 
validation. During the analysis, an extensive review and preprocessing of patient records collected from a public 
hospital was carried out. Then, during the design several ensemble machine learning algorithms were compared and 
selected for the investigation. To name a few: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Stacking, Bagging, and Random 
Forest. The following phases, development and validation were completed using data processing software. In all 
models proposed here, instead of a simple hold-out, a 10-fold cross-validation scheme was applied. For the purposes 
of this research, twenty thousand patient records collected in 2020 were considered. The complete dataset was split 
in two subsets. One subset for training and test with 80% of the data and another dataset for validation with the 
remaining 20%. During the development of the models, only data for training and for test were used. The validation 
data were used only to measure the models performance with unseen data. Results revealed that regardless the size 
of the training and test dataset, there was a notorious consistency in the correct prediction rates. The proposed 
ensemble scheme made of three base learner plus a meta algorithm, systematically leaded to correct prediction rates 
close to 82%. In conclusion, the proposed models proved that, with based on the existing data, high rates of correct 
prediction can be achieved when an ensemble scheme is used. In this case, with a reasonable certainty, it was 
possible to predict whether a patient was going to be referred to another unit or sent home after his or her stay at 
ICU.

1. Introduction
Delivering high quality medical care and services requires collecting, preprocessing and analyzing large amounts of 
heterogeneous data to extract valuable information that must presented in intelligible and user-friendly format. The 
availability of new technologies and the adoption of concepts such as internet of things (IoT), intelligent 
environments (SE), and smart devices are becoming an enormous contribution to different medical areas (Ivanovic, 
2023). 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is contributing decisively to consolidate the so called P4 Medicine (Predictive, 
Personalized, Preventive and Participatory) by means of adding new data processing capabilities in diverse areas 
such as DNA sequencing, electronic medical records, and the environmental variables to which people have been 
exposed which can be understood by analyzing computer tomography images, electroencephalograms, text in 
electronic medical records, pharmacological data, etc. (Ruiz and Velasquez, 2023).

6. Conclusion 
The extensive ICU database allowed researchers to gain a good understanding of a critical hospital unit. The 
application of adequate tools and innovative techniques can certainly be of great help during the decision making 
process by means of revealing more improvement opportunities. 
 
It always interesting to see how once and again the principle of Pareto is present. During the preprocessing of data, it 
was verified that almost 70% of all hospitalization were associated to only 20% of all medical specialties. 
 
Decision making support tools based on techniques and software packages to extract valuable information from 
large repositories of data, undoubtedly are an alternative that deserve proper attention. Although counting with a 
rather large database, the proposed models minimized the data requirements and yet delivered promising results. In 
total, eleven fields were considered to develop the prediction models. The transformation of the field Reason for 
visit from a string to a vector of words provided additional pieces of information that helped develop more complex 
models. 
 
In general, the use of an ensemble scheme to combine the features of different learning algorithms produces better 
results than the use single algorithms predicting alone. When working with machine learning schemes, it is 
advisable to apply a cross-validation to minimize the influence of the dataset split up instead of simply holding out 
part of the data. Averaging several results will be better than having only one result. Furthermore, running 
replications help reduce the bias caused by the fold partitioning. Additionally, having a set of unknown data only for 
validation help confirming whether the models can generalize properly or not.  
 
The experimental result showed that having larger datasets does not necessarily lead to better results in terms of the 
rate of correct predictions. Either with four or sixteen thousand records, the correct prediction rate fluctuated barely 
around 82%. 
 
The consistency found in the prediction rates obtained with a cross-validation scheme on training and test data, with 
a set of unknown validation data, and with set with unknown data proved that the proposed models were able to 
generalize properly.

Finally, prediction ratios, precision and recall curves, ROC area, and the corresponding confusion matrices suggest 
that the proposed prediction models based on ensemble scheme can predict the destination of a ICU-discharged 
patient and, therefore, they could be used to estimate resource requirements at hospitals and clinics.

Abstract 
An emergency department (ED) is a specialized area where patients usually arrive in critical condition and require 
immediate care. Medical staff know that in these cases reacting quickly is crucial for saving patients’ life. Since 
supplies, personnel and infrastructure are limited resources, the efficiency in their use is fundamental to operate 
adequately. Therefore, planning well in advance is fundamental to optimize the use of the existing resources. This 
research presents an interesting approach to forecast the number of patients received at the ED of a public hospital 
by means of implementing and comparing model bases in machine learning algorithms. This investigation was 
carried out following a 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. During the phase of 
analysis, the ED database with recorded collected during 2020 was reviewed and preprocessed. Data were prepared 
and organized to show number of patients visiting ED every day. During the phase of design, machine learning 
algorithms for forecasting were analyzed and compared. Among others: linear regression, artificial neural network, 
machine support vectors, and Gaussian methods. The development and the validation phases were carried out 
entirely using the data processing software WEKA 3.9.6 with the forecasting package version 1.1.27. In total, over 
seventy thousand records corresponding to ED visits occurred during 2020 were used in the investigation. Data were 
divides in two datasets: one for building forecasting models and another one for comparing predicted and actual 
values. Six forecasting horizons were study: 60, 45, 30, 15, 10, and 6 days. For each horizon four machine learning 
algorithms were used to predict the number of ED visits. To evaluate and compare predictions, the usual error 
metrics were considered: MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE. Forecasting results revealed notorious differences in the 
accuracy of the predicted values. Although no big differences are noticeable when forecasting short periods, the 
prediction error is considerable when forecasting a long period of 60 days. In this case, MAPE fluctuated between 
39% and 16% depending on the algorithm. When forecasting short periods, for instance 5 days, MAPE varied 
between 17% and 14%. In conclusion, experimental results showed that ML-based forecasting algorithms can be 
used to predict the number of ED visits with accuracy even when with long forecasting horizons. The application of 
such approach might be of great help to estimate resource requirements and to support decision making.

1. Introduction
In many countries, including Chile, the government is the most important funding source for healthcare. Since it is 
money collected from tax-payers, there is a real necessity for being efficient in the use of these resources (Budarin 
and Elbek, 2022). 
The overcrowding in emergency departments is a serious and globalized problem. It so commonly associated with 
ineffective or incomplete treatments that difficult discharging unrecovered patients. Counting with accurate forecasts 
of future demand for medical care would help planning and allocating resources more efficiently, improving both 
the efficiency and the overall quality perceived by patients (Tuominen et al., 2022). 
Different statistical tools and forecasting models have been used for decades in the health care sector. Recently, in 
Kenya a SEIR model (Susceptible, Exposed or latent, Infectious or Removed) to forecast the COVID-19 pandemic

6. Conclusion 
ED database is an extensive collection of data from which valuable information about daily operations can be 
extracted. Since the efficiency in the use of limited resources is crucial for the public health system, it is worthwhile 
exploring new approaches, methodologies and tools to help support planning and managing tasks. 
Monthly number of ED patients revealed the presence of trends, seasonality, and randomness. All of which is an 
obstacle for any prediction attempts.  
 
Contrary to classical and well-studied approaches, this works was focused in the use of machine learning instead. 
The idea was simple, splitting up the data leaving a fraction for building forecasting models and the part for 
comparing predicted and actual values. Four algorithms were used to forecast and four error measures were used to 
compare results. In all cases, six forecasting horizons were compared. 
 
Experimental work showed that for short forecasting periods all algorithms were able to forecast accurately and 
MAPE fluctuating between 14% and 17%. In the case of long forecasting periods, for instance 61 days, predicted 
values were usually far from actual values. However, values predicted with ANN and SVM were clearly closer to 
actual values than those ones predicted with models based either on linear regression or Gaussian processes. Here 
MAPE fluctuated between 13% and 57%.  
 
Another interesting fact is the consistency in the accuracy of the prediction with the SVM-based model regardless 
the magnitude of the forecasting horizon. Other models’ performances seemed to be affected by the extension of the 
forecasting period . 
 
Finally, this word showed that some forecasting models based on machine learning algorithms delivers good results 
even when the dealing with long forecasting horizons. The consistency in the accuracy of the predictions obtained 
with a SVM-based model indicates that the proposed approach can be useful to predict the number of ED patients 
and therefore, it could be used to support planning and managing tasks.

Abstract 
Dengue fever is currently a global public health problem. Various strategies or efforts have been made including 
vaccination, fogging, use of mosquito repellent, mosquito nets, and so on. Recently, there was a new effort using 
Wolbachia bacteria aimed at controlling the vector of the disease, namely the Aedes Aegypti mosquito. In this paper, 
we focus on conducting a bibliometric analysis study of research related to the mathematical model of Wolbachia for 
dengue fever control using RStudio bibliometric and VosViewer. This paper aims to explore the following 
information: (1) trend and impact of Wolbachia model research on dengue disease control; (2) authors, countries, and 
sources who wrote or published a lot on this research; (3) articles that are widely cited because of their influence and 
impact; (4) keywords that are widely used in this research; (5) the topic of Wolbachia in Dengue which provides an 
opportunity for further research.

1. Introduction
Dominantly, dengue fever is a disease that is transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito to humans. To a lesser extent, 
this mosquito can also be transmitted by the Aedes albopictus mosquito. This disease is a very important health 
problem to be addressed in many countries. The spread of this disease is generally found in tropical areas including 
Southeast Asia, East Asia, namely Hong Kong, South Asia, namely India, and many more. Dengue fever with severe 
conditions was first recognized in 1950. Currently, dengue fever consists of four serotypes namely DENV-1, DENV-
2, DENV 3, and DENV-4. 
Various efforts were made to control the spread of dengue fever. These control efforts can be in the form of upstream 
and downstream control. Upstream control is control carried out on disease vectors, namely mosquitoes. This upstream 
control includes the use of mosquito repellent, insecticide, and fogging. Downstream control is control that is given 
directly to humans for prevention and treatment, including drugs and vaccines. However, these efforts are still not 
able to holistically deal with dengue fever. Recently, a new effort was made to control dengue fever using Wolbachia 
bacteria. The use of this bacterium is the control of dengue fever aimed at vectors. 
Along with the rapid development of technology, research on bibliometric analysis is in great demand and is widely 
carried out. Bibliometric analysis provides information about little or much development on a research topic (Al 
Husaeni and Nandiyanto, 2022). In addition, bibliometric analysis has objectives including ascertaining whether the 
proposed topic is still relevant, trending, and influential, finding a research novelty that variables or other things have 
not been done on the topic, and much more that can be explored. 
Bibliometric analysis research can focus on the topic being studied, the insights studied, the source database used, the 
limitations of the study, the software used to visualize the data and others. Some of the software used to perform 
bibliometric analysis include VosViewer, RStudio bibliometric, CiteSpace. Several researchers conducted 
bibliometric analysis studies on COVID-19 using VosViewer in cases of COVID19 research (Hamidah et al., 2020;

Abstract 
The main purpose of preventive healthcare services is to minimize the risk of serious health conditions and increase 
the probability of early detection and diagnosis of serious illness. Therefore, the effectiveness and efficiency of a 
preventive healthcare service design play a crucial role in increasing the level of participation in such services. 
Additionally, the recent Covid-19 outbreak once again showed that implementing an effective preventive healthcare 
service design can make substantial savings on healthcare expenditures while promoting the welfare of society. 
Preventive healthcare-related location studies are relatively young compared to other studies considering other 
healthcare facility location studies. Although academic research on determining preventive healthcare facilities dates 
back to the early 2000s, there exists a body of literature that can be a review study topic. Hence, in this study, we 
present a brief review of the literature that considers location and design problems related to preventive healthcare 
facilities. We also discuss the basic features of the preventive healthcare service design problem and solution 
approaches proposed. 
Keywords 
Facility location, preventive healthcare, discrete location problems, and public health. 
1. Introduction
Solving and recovering from health-related problems is much easier if an illness is diagnosed at an early stage. This 
also reduces the costs of diagnosing and treating the illness. Preventive services and programs are proven to be 
contributing to better life quality of patients by reducing the likelihood of receiving radical treatments such as surgery 
or chemotherapy, as well as saving their lives (Zhang et al. 2020). Previous studies showed that even a small amount 
of improvement in the participation of these services can save massive amounts of money for healthcare organizations 
and governments (Davari et al. 2016). Preventive healthcare is considered the most effective and efficient way of 
preventing disease and increasing public health in both developed and developing countries. These services aim to 
minimize the risk of getting caught to a serious illness and increase the probability of early diagnosis. Cancer screening 
programs, mammograms, anti-smoking advice, flu shots, and blood tests are among the most well-known services. 
Within the past three decades, preventive services have been an integral part of several healthcare reform programs 
worldwide, and there has been an increased emphasis on the quality and performance of these services (Verter and 
Lapierre 2002). People receiving preventive healthcare services have the option and flexibility of choosing when and 
where to receive service. Thus, the accessibility and attractiveness of facilities in preventive healthcare services play 
a crucial role in increasing the participation of the population in these programs.  
The problem of designing preventive healthcare facilities is closely related to the field of location science as well as 
service operations. Facility location problems consider optimally locating, relocating, or expanding facilities, e.g. 
police stations, hospitals, retail branches, warehouses, schools, fire stations, bank branches, post stations, and military 
installations, concerning one or multiple objectives (Karatas et al. 2019). The problem of locating preventive 
healthcare is a relatively new field of study in location science literature. Although the literature on designing 
preventive healthcare services is sparse, the increasing demand for these services coupled with the lessons learned 
from the Covid-19 pandemic led to the need for designing more efficient and effective networks. The pandemic once 
again showed that success in fighting diseases is strongly related to the preparedness level of healthcare facilities and 
the effective use of resources (Wu et al. 2020, Eriskin et al. 2022). Therefore, the topic of preventive healthcare design

5. Conclusion 
The ultimate goal of this study is to introduce readers to the most prominent preventive healthcare service design and 
facility location problems. Although the literature on this topic is sparse, we encountered several studies published in 
the last two decades. Our review also revealed that although the problem investigated in this review is in the operations 
research arena for nearly two decades, it is gaining interest in the last 5 years. This is probably due to the social 
awareness on the benefit of using preventive and screening services as well as the lessons learned from the Covid-19 
pandemic. The need for designing more efficient and effective healthcare systems and resource allocation plans led to 
an increased number of studies. We hope that this review can be a useful and inspirational source for further research 
on preventive healthcare facility location problems. 
 
Our study reveals that one of the common features of these studies is that they are all discrete location models, i.e., 
facilities can be established only at candidate demand points (locations). Secondly, most studies only focus on the 
travel time and waiting time and their relationship in the mathematical formulations developed. One reason for that 
might be the simplicity of this assumption. However future studies could incorporate other factors such as service 
quality, service cost, parking time and availability, etc. Another future research direction can be the use of stochastic 
user equilibrium. Finally, the location and routing of mobile screening and preventive test centers could be a topic of 
research for future studies.

Abstract 
Emergency Medical Services (EMSs) provide necessary urgent medical care and transport patients to the nearest 
medical center for treatment. Due the to nature of the service, response time is of utmost importance for reducing 
mortality and alleviating human suffering. Moreover, the availability of service at the time of the call is another 
planning factor that should be considered. In fatal traffic accidents, for instance, the probability of death increases 
dramatically as a function of response time. Therefore, locating EMS stations and allocating ambulances to emergency 
calls requires careful and analytical planning. In this study, we aim to determine the locations and sizes of EMS 
stations in Istanbul. We formulate a multi-objective integer programming model that finds optimal locations of service 
stations and the number of ambulances to be stationed while satisfying response time and availability constraints. Our 
model also addresses allocation decisions where each demand point (subdistrict) is allocated to an EMS station that 
will ensure predetermined service levels in terms of response time and availability. In order to determine the number 
of ambulances to be located at a station, historical EMS calls are analyzed. To ensure a particular level of availability, 
the problem is formulated as a Q-coverage problem where the total number of ambulances to be stationed at an EMS 
station is driven by the demand (EMS calls) of subdistricts that are covered. The objectives of the model are to 
minimize the total cost of opening EMS stations and to minimize the total demand weighted distance of subdistricts 
to EMS stations. We solve the problem for the Anatolian side of Istanbul.

Being a critical part of the modern health system, the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) aims at providing urgent 
medical care and transporting patients to the nearest medical center for treatment. An efficient EMS system is expected 
to respond to emergency calls rapidly and provide timely treatment because response time is of utmost importance for 
reducing mortality and alleviating human suffering. Considered as an essential performance measure for the EMS, the 
response time is the time between an emergency call and arrival of the ambulance to the scene (Olivos and Caceres 
2022). In fatal traffic accidents, for instance, the probability of death increases dramatically as a function of response 
time. Therefore, locating EMS stations and allocating ambulances to emergency calls require careful and analytical 
planning.  
The trade-offs between efficiency vs. equity and service quality vs. cost pose additional challenges for decisions 
pertaining to EMS planning. The conventional emergency vehicle location problem deals with locating the vehicles 
to proper stations so as to provide adequate coverage to the demand. Along with the coverage, the number of vehicles 
to be located at a particular station is another decision to be made. Due to high costs of emergency vehicles, i.e., 
ambulances, allocating a large number of vehicles to stations is not a viable option. Therefore, optimally locating a 
limited (or minimum) number of ambulances to improve the responsiveness of the EMS system is an important 
problem faced by the healthcare authorities (Moeini et al. 2015). 
Based on the decision-making levels, decisions pertaining to EMS management can be classified into (i) strategic, (ii) 
tactical, and (iii) operational decisions (Belanger et al. 2019). Strategic level decisions involve determining the 
locations of EMS stations and the number of ambulances to allocate these stations (sizing). Along with strategic

Numerical results and the corresponding analysis are explained to the DM in detail. This process is particularly 
beneficial for the DM to understand the nature of the problem and the impact of the weights assigned to each objective. 
In the light of these findings, the DM can make the trade-offs between these two objectives and determine his/her 
most preferred solution.  
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we aim to solve the EMS station location-allocation and sizing problem for the Anatolian side of Istanbul. 
Establishing an efficient EMS system is of utmost importance for saving lives and alleviating human suffering. The 
time between an emergency call being received and an ambulance arriving at the location of the incident is critical 
because the probability of death increases dramatically as a function of response time. Therefore, locating EMS 
stations and allocating ambulances to emergency calls requires careful and analytical planning.  
To that end, we formulate a multi-objective integer programming model that finds the optimal locations of EMS 
stations and the number of ambulances to be stationed while satisfying response time and availability constraints. 
EMS location-allocation and sizing problem inherently involves multiple objectives to consider. Hence, we seek to 
minimize the total cost of establishing ESM stations which comprises the cost of opening (installing) EMS stations 
and the acquisition cost of ambulances while minimizing the total demand weighted distance of subdistricts to EMS 
stations. Having two conflicting objectives to optimize, we adopted a posteriori approach and generated a 
representative set of non-dominated solutions which constitute the Pareto frontier. In this regard, we presented 
comprehensive solution information to the DM to provide adequate decision support for selecting the most preferred 
solution among the five Pareto-optimal solutions. 
There are two research directions for future work. Firstly, our model does not consider uncertainty within emergency 
call demand. However,  the demand for EMS is inherently uncertain and varies with respect to the time of the day. 
Therefore, a stochastic or robust modeling framework that also addresses operational decisions such as relocation and 
dispatching can be utilized to hedge against uncertainty. For this purpose, historical data should be obtained and 
analyzed thoroughly. Secondly, other preference elicitation approaches such as a priori and interactive methods can 
be used to elicit DM preference structure

Abstract 
The main objective of this study was to explore the short term consumer credit high interest rate conundrum and the 
infectiveness of policy regulatory interventions. The study develops an alternative model which addresses the major 
interest rate cost drivers subject to stakeholder engagement through suitability, acceptability and feasibility 
assessment. This was because previous studies have arguably unsuccessfully attempted to solve the matter through 
policy regulation albeit without satisfactory stakeholder engagement hence the shortcomings.  Detailed Action 
Research Model was used. Multivariate data from 8000 short term consumer credit stakeholders was analysed using 
Google Forms analytics, Advanced Microsoft Excel Statistics Analysis Package (AMESAP) and N vivo. The measure 
of strength of evidence against the null hypothesis amongst individual consumers was about 87.5% on the suitability 
centric hypothesis and 100% on both acceptability and feasibility centric hypothesis. The semantic and thematic 
analysis on merchants and employers as key stakeholders indicated about 80% suitability and acceptability, and about 
90% for feasibility. These findings suggest that the alternative model informed by key stakeholder engagement would 
be more appropriate to address the adverse effects of high cost short term consumer credit than regulation.

Short-term Consumer Credit, High Interest Rates, Policy Regulatory ineffectiveness 
1. Introduction
The high interest rates and exploitative tendencies associated with short term consumer credit relative to other credit 
facilities have attracted a lot of attention from policy makers because of leading to high household indebtedness and 
consumer financial distress (Malone and Skiba, 2020; OECD, 2019; Schwartz and Robinson, 2018; Servon, 2017; 
Skiba, 2012). The other cause for concern is that demand for short term credit continues growing hence stakeholders 
interpreting this as also a possible increase in the related adverse effects (Servon, 2017; Bhutta, Skiba and Tobacman, 
2015; Stegman, 2007). It is against this background that stakeholders have been searching for solutions in various 
ways albeit without much success as suggested by the continuous global outcry (Malone and Skiba, 2020). The most 
suggested solution seems to be inclined towards regulation but this has been pursued since the advent of short term 
credit such as payday loans in the early 1990s with little success (Servon, 2017).  
This study advances that the failure to satisfactorily deal this conundrum has been due to failure to address the cost 
drivers which are embedded in the Interest Rate and poor stakeholder engagement by policy makers who have adopted 
a reductionism methodology in policy formulation (Miller, 2013; Ackerman, 1999; Arrow and Debreu, 1954). 
Therefore, inasmuch as regulation can be part of the interventions, the consumer reductionist methodology ends up 
leading to adverse developments such as lenders conniving with consumers to modify their loans to evade regulations 
on interest rates, loan lengths, loan sizes, and repayment procedures such as allowing loans to roll over (GRZ, 2021; 
Malone and Skiba, 2020; He and Tian, 2020; Bernier and Plouffe, 2019). Under this methodology, regulation also has 
implementation shortcomings based on jurisdiction and complexity of short term credit consumer risk drivers such as 
general economic context, life events and behavioral biases (OECD, 2019; Li et al. 2012).

Qualitative centric responses from Merchants  
 
 The Merchant’s overview on Consumer net income increase and sales volume for merchants was that such 
would mostly lead to an increase in sales volume.  
 The Merchant’s overview on Merchant’s consumer trust basis for debt based transactions was that in addition 
to demographics, much emphasis should be placed on work or entrepreneurial experience and level of 
education.  
 The Merchant’s overview on Extension of a 30 days’ credit facility if default risk is significantly reduced 
was that most would extend such credit facilities.  
 The Merchant’s overview Payroll, insurance or underwriter as means of reducing default risk for merchants 
to extend credit facilities was that most would consider these to be appropriate.  
 The Merchant’s overview on Reputation and credit facility was that most would consider a proven record of 
honesty as a basis to extend credit facilities.  
 The Merchant’s overview on time/period appropriate to rely on a consumer’s reputation of honestly for credit 
facilities consideration was that most would consider at least 6 months.  
The Merchant’s overview on Consumer commitment to good reputation was that most would rely on a consumer’s 
commitment to good reputation if defaulting meant this reputation being tarnished and other stakeholders knowing 
about such.  
 
7. Conclusion 
The main objective of this study was to explore the short term consumer credit high interest rate conundrum, the 
infectiveness of policy regulatory interventions and developing an alternative short term consumer credit Interest Rate 
Model. Therefore, study developed an alternative model which addresses the major interest rate cost drivers subject 
to stakeholder engagement through suitability, acceptability and feasibility assessment. This was because previous 
studies had arguably unsuccessfully attempted to solve the matter through policy regulation albeit without satisfactory 
stakeholder engagement hence the shortcomings. The measure of strength of evidence against the null hypothesis 
amongst individual consumers was about 87.5% on the suitability centric hypothesis and 100% on both acceptability 
and feasibility centric hypothesis. The semantic and thematic analysis on merchants and employers as key stakeholders 
indicated about 80% suitability and acceptability, and about 90% for feasibility.  The overall findings suggest that the 
alternative model would be suitable, feasible and acceptable to key stakeholders. Therefore, the study contributes to 
relevant existing theory and practice by advancing a proactive possible solution to the short term consumer interest 
rate conundrum. The results basically advocate for market driven solutions such as addressing the interest rate cost 
drivers to market problems unlike policy regulatory measures which are based on the inadequate reductionist 
methodology. Therefore, the results suggest the foregoing approach to be the most appropriate approach as suggested 
by the positive suitability, acceptability and feasibility assessment feedback from key stakeholders.

Abstract 
Cryptocurrency usage has been on a rise in Zambia and other countries. Many concerns have been raised regarding 
the bad vices that have emerged as a result of Cryptocurrency usage. However, little evidence exists on the effects that 
Cryptocurrency usage has on money laundering and tax compliance in Zambia. This study sought to assess the 
relationship between Cryptocurrency usage, money laundering and tax compliance in Zambia. The study was 
conducted on the FIC, DEC and ZRA for in-depth interviews and 106 survey respondents consisting of employees of 
one of the commercial banks in Zambia. The study adopted a mixed approach, with the utilization of an interview 
guide to collect information through an in-depth interview with the key informants and a semi-structured questionnaire 
to collect data from the survey respondents. Correlation and regression analyses were used to establish the relationship 
among the variables of the study. The results of the study showed that Cryptocurrency usage has a positive but 
insignificant effect on money laundering and negative but insignificant effect on tax compliance in Zambia. The study 
further established that a strong negative correlation exists between money laundering and tax compliance in Zambia. 
Perceptions from the respondents were that an increase in Cryptocurrency activities, due to unregulated crypto 
environment, would increase money laundering activities. This is only supported by the observed sign of the 
correlation coefficient. In addition, since no legal framework has been put in place to guide the legal jurisdictions and 
operation of digital assets, levels of none tax compliance would become high in Zambia and this is equally supported 
by the observed sign of the correlation coefficient.  The study has identified other effects such as fraud, terrorism, 
interfere with consumer protection and increase in the scamming levels in association with Cryptocurrency usage. 
Prevention of these vices was pointed to the centralization and unifying the Cryptocurrency transaction by the Central 
Bank. The study thus recommends that Zambia should consider investing in the investigation of how digital 
transactions can operate in order to quicken the regulation process of crypto operation. The government should also 
consider setting up an institution that can be strictly responsible for monitoring and regulating digital assets 
transactions in order to focus resources in the formulation of legal frameworks.

Since early 2010 Cryptocurrencies have gained more prominence in monetary discussions all across the globe. 
Economists, Bankers, Politicians, Media personnel and even the general citizenry of many countries in both the 
developed and the developing world have come up with various opinions on this latest monetary phenomenon. The

A further regression analysis was conducted to establish the effect of Cryptocurrency usage on tax compliance in 
Zambia. The results are presented in Table 6 below. The results show that Cryptocurrency has an insignificant effect 
on tax compliance in Zambia. This follows from the t-statistic value of -1.031 and the corresponding p-value of 0.305. 
Since the p-value of 0.305 is greater than the 10% level of significance, the effect of Cryptocurrency on tax compliance 
is insignificant in Zambia.

6. Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations 
6.1 Summary of findings 
The overall objective of this study was to assess the relationship that Cryptocurrency usage has with Money laundering 
and tax compliance in Zambia. The study was conducted on one of the commercial banks in Zambia with a sample 
size of 116 employees of that commercial bank. 91 out of the 116 respondents appeared to have knowledge on 
Cryptocurrency and so they constituted the sample of interest and the results presented were based on the 91 
respondents. 
Evidence from the correlation analysis revealed that there is no significant correlation between Cryptocurrency usage 
and money laundering in Zambia. Further, no significant correlation was observed between Cryptocurrency usage and 
tax compliance in Zambia. However, the correlation coefficients have a positive sign for the Cryptocurrency usage – 
money laundering relationship and negative sign for the Cryptocurrency usage – tax compliance relationship. 
Further evidence was observed from regression analysis for the cryptocurrency usage – money laundering – tax 
compliance relationship. The results show that Cryptocurrency usage has an insignificant effect on both money 
laundering and tax compliance in Zambia. 
6.2 Conclusion 
Despite the insignificant effects, there have been many concerns highlighted by the respondents regarding the use of 
Cryptocurrency. These concerns are around money laundering and none-tax compliance. Evidence from ZRA 
1778","Proceedings of the 1st Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

indicates that money laundering and tax evasion are main results of Crypto transactions. Through the use of digital 
assets, holders of these assets tend to transact in an unregulated environment. This has seen the skyrocketing of money 
laundering in Zambia and other parts of the world where Crypto activities are unregulated. The loophole through 
which Cryptocurrency has found its comfortable operation has created other bad vices.  
BOZ (2018) indicated the Cryptocurrency associated risks, which include, hacking, fraud, money laundering, 
consumer protection risks, and financing activities of terrorism. These vices create a need for concern for Zambia and 
other states where Cryptocurrency is not prohibited. It is thus concluded that Policy makers need to constantly engage 
in solving the problem of regulation. The survey respondents also indicated the same concerns with a skewed response 
towards strong agreement to the bad vices being caused by Cryptocurrency usage. 
6.3 Recommendations 
The recommendations of the study include the following: 
Zambia should consider investing in the investigation of how digital transactions can operate. This will 
quicken the regulation process of crypto operation and the Zambian government should also consider setting 
up an institution that can be strictly responsible for monitoring and regulating digital assets transactions. This 
will help to focus resources in the formulation of legal frameworks

Abstract 
The ongoing pandemic has posed significant challenges for supply chains globally. The international lockdowns still 
happening have contributed to the bottlenecks seen in the flow of raw materials and finished goods and the disruptions 
seen in manufacturing. In short, the pandemic has brought to light many overlooked vulnerabilities in the global supply 
chain. The most critical of these problems lies in analytics. Many major companies currently process supply chain 
data in the form of excel spreadsheets which has been shown to be highly problematic and holistically inefficient. This 
paper will examine digitalized supply chain software/dashboards and explore how major conglomerates can leverage 
these descriptive-analytic technologies to engage in collaborative planning with suppliers and customers and to obtain 
end-to-end enterprise visibility.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 has ravaged the world. Initially thought to be benign, the virus shut down the global economy and brought 
worldwide operations to a screeching halt. People have lost loved ones, their jobs, and their livelihoods. Once reaping 
the rewards of a stable and healthy global economy, multinational conglomerates now watch as their revenues shrink 
to a mere fraction of what they once were. However, our recovery from the pandemic has been nothing short of 
magnificent. With the slow reopening of businesses and the resuming of global operations, we have been able to make 
up significant ground and almost carry on with business as if the pandemic never happened.  
In truth, we cannot put the pandemic behind us as it's shown us many vulnerabilities in the global supply chain, 
especially with how we currently manage data and conduct analysis. It's been found that many of these major 
organizations process supply chain data in the form of excel spreadsheets which has been shown to be highly 
problematic due to dataset size and lack of visualization, thus incurring high amounts of downtime. Without effective 
logistic strategies, data visualization, and adaptable infrastructure to combat the rising strains on our supply chains, 
we will soon be unable to coordinate the movement of our products timely, safely, and effectively.  
1.1Objectives 
This paper aims to analyze the impact that descriptive-analytic technologies could have on our supply chains and 
manufacturing processes when paired with End-to-End Supply Chain methodologies. This paper will provide insight 
into how implementing modernized supply chain-centered technologies could make Supply Chain Management more 
methodical, streamlined, and productive. 
1.2 Paper Organization 
This paper is organized into various key sections. These sections include an explanation of Descriptive-Analytic 
Technology, an overview of what End-to-End Enterprise Visibility is, a collection of Case Studies on the matter, and 
a conclusion to wrap up your future understanding of End-to-End Enterprise Visibility software packages.

100% visibility with 100% accuracy resulting in 50 times their ROI. In the CloudLeaf article, Maria Nieradka was 
quoted stating, ""Technologies such as the Cloudleaf platform, that enable you to get real-time, granular data providing 
complete visibility into your supply chain, along with smart contingency planning, are now required to deal with 
managing day-to-day business, achieving business strategy and being able to manage the next risk that comes your 
way"" (Veerina 2022). 
 
5. Conclusion 
Today, Supply Chain managers square up against growing challenges encircling the increasing complexity, rising 
volatility, multi-layered cost structure, and risks attributed to their organization's Supply Chain. Managers at major 
conglomerates find themselves asking where their goods are, are their goods on time, how much they have in 
inventory, and how much safety stock they have. End-to-End Enterprise Visibility allows these Supply Chain 
Managers to answer these questions and more in a tenth of the time. Visibility gives these managers unparalleled 
access to data across an organization and allows them to ensure they have complete and accurate information truly. 
This enables SCMs to communicate and collaborate effectively to beat stakeholder and customer expectations, 
engineer better product offerings, and optimize business processes to build value and support institutional goals.  
 
SCMs can then review and leverage the data End-to-End Visibility provides with Descriptive Analytic technologies. 
Descriptive Analytic technologies are tools that aggregate data and apply statistics and modeling to create reports 
depicting an institution's past and current data. That said, the greater an organization's visibility, the more accurate 
and complete data a Descriptive Analytic software can utilize to create more strategically useful insights. These 
improvements and scalebacks can be applied anywhere within an organization to improve everything from cash flow 
management to NPI and the development of future products. Furthermore, more recent advances in Descriptive-
Analytic Technology have enabled Supply Chain Managers with the opportunity to apply multiplex mathematical 
models and Machine Learning to copious amounts of historical data to perform predictive analytics. This aids Supply 
Chain Managers in predicting near-future events, thus providing them with further insight into possible next steps 
their organization could take to ensure future success.

Abstract 
The onset of COVID-19 led to numerous changes in the global supply chain, affecting all members, including 
suppliers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. Consumer demand for e-commerce skyrocketed, and all other supply 
chain members struggled to meet this new demand, with the supply chain disruption becoming most prevalent in 2021. 
One such public disruption was the backlog of container ships at the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which 
continues well into 2022. These backlogs are caused by various issues, including worker shortages, equipment failures, 
and the eCommerce boom. As a result, ships that were once able to arrive and unload their cargo promptly must now 
spend two to three weeks waiting for a spot to clear up in the port. In this paper, we will examine the root causes of 
the backlog of container ships occurring at the ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach and provide our findings and 
analysis of possible avenues to decrease or end this disruption.

Supply Chain, Ports, COVID-19, and Marine Chassis. 
1. Introduction
1.1. Background of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, within the San Pedro Bay Port Complex,  have ranked the highest in
container volume and cargo value in the United States every year since 2000. The port is the leading gateway for trade
between the United States and countries in Asia (Port of Los Angeles, 2022). Trade activities at the port of Long
Beach generate 1.4 million jobs in the United States and serve as one of the primary drivers of the economy of not
only Long Beach but Southern California as a whole, with more than $140 billion worth of cargo moving through
these ports every year (Port of Long Beach, 2022). The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach combined handled 31%
of all US imports and exports via containers via sea freight, meaning the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach
maintain the largest share of the market of sea freight shipment in the United States (Facts and Figures | Port of Los
Angeles, 2022). With the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach having such a large market share compared to the
other ports along the West Coast, the effects of the failures at the ports were felt across the United States.
1.1.1. Disruptions of the Supply Chain 
The ports located in Los Angeles and Long Beach have been experiencing a sharp increase in delays since 2019, with 
the numerous disruptions to the supply chain heavily contributing to the ports being unable to meet the number of 
shipping containers that need to be offloaded. The major supply chain disruption came in the form of the COVID-19 
pandemic causing complications to arise regarding the necessary labor to keep the ports running smoothly. The number 
of ships waiting for berths offshore has numbered in the dozens since the start of the pandemic, with 2021 marking 
the year when the number of vessels waiting for berths reached its all-time high. 
1.2. Motivation 
The number of container ships waiting for berths at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach has seen little 
improvement with the continued evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The change in consumer buying trends has 
contributed to this situation as well; the pandemic has led to a sharp increase in the demand for eCommerce. This 
eCommerce boom created a higher demand than ever for foreign-made products necessitating an increase in sea 
freight, meaning more container ships needed to be processed to meet this new level of demand, and the current failure

assistance in this area could give more time for domestic chassis manufacturers to increase their production capacity 
to meet the demand. 
 
5.3.3. Land Acquisition for Increased Storage Space 
Additionally, another method to unload more cargo is to find land nearby for additional storage space. Dedicating land 
to assist the ports is a project in itself, where local governments will have to justify where and how to assign this land. 
Due to the logistics of maintaining container storage, there are concerns about pollution from the emissions from 
trucks and other equipment used and the storage of potentially hazardous materials. Adding new storage areas will 
take a long time to get in place, but it could help alleviate the current strain on the ports and possibly prevent future 
incidents of this level from occurring at the ports. 
 
5.3.4. Regulatory Changes 
A final method to assist with cargo unloading is to suspend and redo several rules and regulations surrounding the 
operations in the ports. In a letter sent to Governor Newsom, a coalition of several business groups, including the 
California Retailers Association, Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, and the Agricultural Council of 
California, asked for modifications to current laws surrounding port operations. The most relevant questions are for 
the suspension of environmental and pollution laws, suspending the state's landmark worker status law reclassifying 
independent contractors as employees, and suspending a law requiring warehouses to disclose quotas and work speed 
to workers.  
 
5.3.5. Alleviate Shortage of Truckers 
In addition to these, possible changes regarding regulations and rules would be to hire more truck drivers to make up 
for the shortage of 80,000 drivers. There may need to be extra incentives needed to attract and hire more drivers, so a 
possible solution for this would be to increase truck driver pay. While this would cost additional money, there would 
be great benefits from increasing the labor force. Similarly, it would be beneficial to expand the operating time of the 
port, which would require additional workers and money to pay the workers and run the port. The port of Los Angeles 
recently expanded the operating hours of the port to 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to relieve the supply chain issues. 
 
5.4. Validation 
Recently, the port officials expanded the operating hours of both the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week. This has resulted in helping the ports recover from the supply chain issues as the pandemic is 
starting to end by clearing cargo at a high enough rate to decrease the number of container ships waiting for berths at 
the ports. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The docks at the LA and Long Beach ports, as well as the systems connected with it have been hit with supply chain 
issues stemming from the pandemic, which has greatly increased wait times and lead times for parts. This has resulted 
in greater costs for products, as well as increased transportation costs. Some of the main problems are the lack of 
available chassis, which negatively affects the possible movement of containers, as well as too many empty containers 
and a lack of truck drivers, which decreases the number of possible products that can be transported on land. In addition 
to this, there are a plethora of other issues, including but not limited to a lack of warehouse space. Possible solutions 
caused by the lack of chassis could be to vertically stack more than the allowed two pallets on each chassis. This 
would possibly decrease safety, but if done well and safely would increase the possible amount of work done by each 
chassis. This would also require legal intervention. Additionally, we could vertically stack cargo more often to 
decrease space utilization as well as use empty land to store cargo. Many of these solutions would require 
modifications to current laws. Other solutions involve hiring more workers, such as truck drivers, to increase the 
amount of possible work done, as well as expanding the operating hours of the port. In conclusion, many of our 
solutions involve working through certain regulations to allow us to move and store cargo more efficiently by 
increasing the workforce and time spent operating.

Identifying Critical Success Factors for Effective Capital 
Structure in Infrastructure Projects under Public-Private 
Partnership

Abstract 
Capital structure is the key to ensuring sufficient funding and achieving Public Private Partnership (PPP) project 
objectives. In Indonesia, this scheme has attracted a lot of attention to meet the enormous demand for 
infrastructure development. However, the successful implementation of PPP projects is often impeded by 
significant capital investments and high uncertainty. Improper capital structure causes many projects to fail. 
Therefore, to overcome these challenges, this study aims to identify the success factors for an effective capital 
structure for PPP projects from several leading academic journals. This study shows that Financial Viability, 
Business Risk, Project Participants, Country Risk Factors and Government Support are the main factors that 
become the basis for effective decision-making in determining the capital structure of infrastructure projects with 
PPP schemes. From the results of the critical success factors obtained in this study, a comparison was attempted 
with the implementation of fulfilling the capital structure in one of the largest PPP projects in Indonesia, namely 
the Trans Sumatera Toll Road (TSTR) project. The parties involved in the PPP implementation are expected to 
know the success factors of the capital structure so that PPP development can be carried out properly.

Capital structure, Infrastructure, Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), Trans Sumatera Toll Road (TSTR) 
1. Introduction
The United Nations Development Programme (1998) defines public-private partnership (PPP) as a cooperative 
mechanism between the government and the private sector to finance, build, and manage infrastructure facilities 
such as power plants, ports, transportation systems, and telecommunication systems. The PPP model allows the 
government and private sector to share the rewards and risks of an infrastructure project, and it also allows the 
government and private sectors to fully utilize their respective advantages in order to optimize project efficiency 
and obtain the best value for money (World Bank, 2011). 
The PPP model has been widely implemented in countries because it efficiently relieves government budgetary 
constraint (World Bank, 2012). When compared to traditional finance models, the PPP model offers distinct 
benefits to the government, such as leveraging private resources and distributing risk. However, the PPP model 
includes disadvantages such as greater finance costs and more interest conflicts when more parties are involved 
at some point. Because the capital structure reflects the interests and obligations of each project stakeholder, a 
PPP-mode project demands a higher level of capital structure management skill to ensure the success of the 
project. 
An effective capital structure can reduce the cost of capital and improve the efficiency of project construction, 
financing, and operation, and this paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the literature review (from both 
theoretical and empirical studies) of capital structure optimization in PPP projects. Public-private partnerships 
involve collaboration between a government agency and a private-sector company that can be used to finance, 
build, and operate projects. Public-private partnerships often involve concessions of tax or other operating 
revenue, protection from liability, or partial ownership rights over nominally public services and property to 
private sector, for-profit entities. Public-private partnerships allow large-scale government projects, such as roads, 
bridges, or hospitals, to be completed with private funding. Capital structure refers to the structure of debt and 
equity capital in corporate finance, which is a dynamic and complicated process that represents investors' investing 
behavior and the value of the firm.

Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian Infrastructure Guarantee Agency. Land acquisition 
is carried out by the State Asset Management Agency (Institution under the Ministry of Finance). From this 
condition, the risks borne by business entity are reduced so that the implementation of development can run better. 
To guarantee the operation of this toll road, there is a Cash Deficiency Support (CDS) facility from a financial 
institution which is used to cover interest payments if the toll road cannot fulfill its obligations. 
 
6.3 Project Participant 
In the initial conditions, business entity experienced difficulties in seeking funding from bank and non-bank 
financial institutions as well as from investors. Currently there are several parties involved in the construction of 
this PPP project including the Government, namely the Indonesian Ministry of Finance, the Indonesian Ministry 
of Public Housing and Public Housing, the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), Lembaga Manajemen 
Aset Negara, and Lembaga Penjamin Infrastruktur Indonesia. Third parties outside the government consist of 
banking and non-banking financial institutions, domestic investors in Indonesia and abroad, construction 
consultants and subcontractors in implementing the construction of these sections. With this support, more parties 
are involved in the development of this PPP project.  
 
6.4 Country Risk Factors 
Rating agency Moody's has decided to maintain the Republic of Indonesia's Sovereign Credit Rating at Baa2 or 
one notch above investment grade. Moody's views this decision as in line with the results of an assessment that 
Indonesia's economic resilience and the effectiveness of monetary and macroeconomic policies are maintained. It 
is also believed that the structural reform policy pursued by the Government will support increased investment 
and support improvement in export competitiveness.  Moody's projects that Indonesia's average economic growth 
will return to pre-pandemic levels, reaching 5%. This average is higher than other countries ranked at Baa, which 
is 3.7%. The forecast for increased economic growth is also supported by various structural reforms that have 
been undertaken by the Government, such as the Job Creation Law and HPP Law, which are aimed at improving 
the investment climate and increasing Government revenue. From a fiscal standpoint, Moody's estimates that the 
Government's debt burden will still increase to a level of 42.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2023, but 
still far lower than other countries ranked Baa, which is 64% of GDP. In addition, Moody's views the ability to 
pay the Government's debt, as well as the portion of loans in foreign currency, still pose a risk to fiscal conditions. 
An assessment conducted by Moody's shows that Indonesia supports the investment climate with a rating of one 
notch above investment grade. 
 
6.5  Government support 
In the initial conditions, there was almost no support from the Government of the Republic of Indonesia in 
developing this PPP project. The proposed business plan includes support from the Government of the Republic 
of Indonesia, including government guarantees, additional state equity participation, additional tariffs, additional 
concession periods, construction support and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia is responsible for land 
acquisition through Lembaga Manajemen Aset Negara. 
 
From the explanation above, an effective capital structure is obtained where 71% of the financing comes from 
debt and 29% comes from equity. There was a decrease in the cost of debt because the loan was guaranteed by 
the Government of the Republic of Indonesia. In addition, there is a CDS facility to cover loan interest payments. 
 
7. Conclusion 
This study identifies the factors that influence the capital structure of a PPP project. The results show the following 
top factors: Financial Viability, Business Risk, Project Participants and Country Factors. The study is intended to 
address the problem of selecting the appropriate capital structure to offer adequate funding for PPP infrastructure 
projects by taking the top considerations. The author made a comparison with the implementation of the TSTR 
development on the island of Sumatra and the results are appropriate. From a theoretical perspective, this research 
not only enriches research on the capital structure of PPP projects. In practice, these findings can be a reference 
for a more comprehensive capital structure solution.  This study has various limitations in addition to achieve the 
research aims. Due to the complexity of the PPP project's capital structure, numerous factors including the source 
and percentage of debt financing might be examined. In addition, this paper does not fully consider the different 
roles of the public and private sectors.  
 
Future research can pay more attention to the differences to achieve more comprehensive results. In addition, 
considering the character of the different project areas or countries, future studies can focus on one particular 
region or country to make an in-depth and targeted analysis.

Abstract 
Manufacturing systems are the mode through which organizations can achieve competitive advantage by producing 
products with the desired wants. Hence, selecting a manufacturing system is one of the critical decisions in formulating 
a manufacturing strategy. Currently, there exist four traditional production systems (TPS) (i.e. job-shop, batch-shop, 
mass, and continuous) and additive manufacturing system (AMS), which appeared as the alternative for TPS during 
Industry 4.0 era. Different process choice criteria (PCC) need to be considered while determining a suitable system 
from five or a hybrid (AMS + TPS) configuration. This research has developed a framework comprising Delphi, 
voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP), and machine learning (ML) based Bayesian network (BN) method 
techniques for selecting a suitable production system by quantifying the strategic fit between PCC and production 
systems. Initially, a pertinent body of knowledge is researched to identify the critical PCC and further validated by 
industry experts through Delphi. This results in retaining thirty-six PCC. The relative importance of an individual 
criterion concerning a particular production system is computed using VAHP in the second stage to understand the 
alignment of PCC in different production systems for exhibiting the congruence between PCC and manufacturing 
systems (TPS and AMS). Total 22 cases falling under different production systems are evaluated for strategic fit 
computation to understand the benchmarked values of PCC in each of the production system environments (TPS and 
AMS). Finally, a suitable production system is selected for a special case of hydraulic and pneumatic valve 
manufacture using a Bayesian network method. The findings offer critical insights into the different PCC and their 
level-of-fit in TMS and AMS, which can assist researchers and practitioners in evaluating a suitable manufacturing 
system for an organization using identified PCC.

Abstract 
The coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) cases that occurred in North Sumatra continued to show an increase from time 
to time. This pandemic has an impact on the weakening of the economy in North Sumatra as well as the increasing 
unemployment rate. This condition is exacerbated by the low level of public trust in the government in handling 
Covid-19. The purpose of this study was to analyze the handling of the Covid-19 in North Sumatra which was carried 
out by the local government and the Covid-19 handling task force. The analysis was carried out using a communication 
management approach. This study recommends the need for government intervention on the people's economy 
through the formation of a task force at the environmental level which is the lowest part of the government structure.

1. Introduction
In the Indonesian province of North Sumatra, the number of cases of coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) is on the rise. 
The distribution estimates have been very steady throughout the city districts since it began spreading in early 2020. 
The same can be said for national data. Government communications, such as erroneous data and information, a lack 
of socialization, and poor public trust, are among the key factors (Wicaksono 2019). 
However, there are four major issues with government communication in dealing with the pandemic on a national 
level, including erroneous data and information, a lack of socialization on various issues, a lack of public confidence, 
and inefficient government communication (Ardiyanti 2020). The ambiguities of the politicization of the pandemic, 
the neglect of research at the start of the crisis, low economic capacity, and a minimal healthcare infrastructure 
intensify the handling of Covid-19..(Winanti 2021). The government's communication strategy for dealing with the 
Covid-19 situation is far from ideal. Especially during the pre-crisis period, when several public figures made 
statements that appeared to downplay Covid-19's threat (Surahmat 2021; Tawai 2021; Suharyanto 2021). While in 
four European countries: Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden, there is a big role in how leadership informs and explains 
strategies against this pandemic (Sjölander-lindqvist 2020 ). 
There have been numerous reports of an increase in Covid-19 instances in Medan. Gender, age, education level, and 
employment status, on the other hand, had no significant impact on Covid-19 preventive behavior (Amelia, 2020 ). 
The management of Covid-19 in North Sumatra also relates to national policies. The increase in cases created a gap 
between the residents of Medan City's perception (performance) and expectations of the Covid-19 Task Force of North 
Sumatra Province (Rezeki 2020 ). Furthermore, this pandemic has an influence not only on public health issues but 
also on an increase in unemployment, necessitating social protection as well as support for companies (big, medium, 
and small) to avoid job losses (Djalante 2020; Kusmanto 2020 ).

6. Conclusion 
In the perspective of communication management, the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in North Sumatra is 
indicated to have problems in five aspects that are reviewed in this study. This situation arises as a result of the 
pandemic's impact, which has resulted in an increase in the number of unemployed people and a falling economy. The 
impact of the Covid-19 epidemic is expected to become a frequent occurrence in Indonesia because it affects many 
areas of the country. Because the pandemic has hit nationally, the central government has also implemented various 
structural policies down to the provincial level. The North Sumatra Provincial Government with the Covid-19 task 
force in North Sumatra is an extension of the central government in handling this pandemic.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine government policies on tourism management in Situngkir Village, Pangururan District, 
Samosir Regency, North Sumatra, Indonesia. The importance of this research is because Situngkir Village is included 
in the tourism trajectory of Lake Toba and Situngkir Indah Beach is one of its mainstay tourist destinations. Of course, 
the existing government policies need to pay attention to the development of tourism in this village. One of them is 
the Toba Batak traditional house which can become an icon for the Indah Situngkir orphanage, for then those along 
the road to tourist attractions, there are several that have been revitalized by government assistance. The type of 
research in this study is qualitative with a descriptive approach. Data collection techniques in this study are 
observation, interviews and documentation. Observations were carried out directly at the research site by observing 
the subject and object of the study. Direct data collection was carried out through in-depth interviews with informants, 
namely village officials, inn owners, food and souvenir traders, cleaners, parking and security guards, inn employees 
and visitors. Documentation is done by recording and documenting the subject and object of research. Based on the 
results of the study, that in Situngkir Village, there was already a government policy which was then carried out by 
the village government in supporting tourism, namely the existence of government assistance to revitalize the Batak 
Toba traditional house which was along the road to Pantai Indah Situngkir. Based on the Government Regulation of 
the Republic of Indonesia No. 72 of 2005 concerning Villages, article 15, that the role of the village government is 
not only to carry out village autonomy but also to manage the potential of the existing village so that there is prosperity 
in the community. Thus, guidance to the community for the advancement of tourism is also carried out, maintaining 
the relationship between the village government and the owners of capital for the progress of development and the 
economy of the community in tourism areas. Homestay that uses traditional houses as a place to live for tourists 
(generally foreign tourists) is an effort to preserve traditional houses so that they are increasingly known in the 
international arena and an effort to preserve and promote the culture of the local community.

Introduction
Indonesia, which has cultural diversity and abundant tourism, can overcome basic problems by strengthening the 
economy by increasing regional income. Through this, as a country that has abundant diversity, Indonesia can develop 
its potential, for example in terms of tourism. This is because tourists visiting Indonesia, both those who only enjoy

The district government also makes a program of cultural events that are held every Saturday. The participants are 
students who attend school in Situngkir village and from outside the village. This is done by the district government 
to attract tourists from outside the area to see the culture in Situngkir village and also to attract tourists (Table 3).

3. Conclusion  
The influence on tourism with the existence of government ecology in Situngkir Village, namely the existence of 
policies that pay attention to the environment in tourism development, Then there is a cooperation between the village 
government and the community as well as the respective functions of the community and village government in the 
advancement of tourism, the community also has the function of policy the. Not only that, ecologically, the village 
government system in Situngkir Village is very influential on tourism, this is indicated by the existence of a village 
fund policy that includes advanced tourism programs in its decisions. 
 
The role of the village government is very important in developing the potential of Pasir Putih Parbaba Beach, namely 
as a party that has authority in the regulation, provision, and allocation of various infrastructures related to tourism 
needs. Not only that, but the regional head is also responsible for determining the direction of tourism travel. 
The relationship between capital owners and the government in building projects is not good if the projects built are 
outside the agreement. For example, the construction of the Jitty pier is a problem because the owner of the capital 
builds a project outside of an agreement with the village government.

Abstract 
The city of Belawan in the province of North Sumatra, Indonesia is a port city inhabited by the urban poor. In this city 
fighting between residents has been going on for decades so that damage and injuries are frequent. This brawl behavior 
is inherited from parents to their children so that Belawan residents consider fights between residents a normal thing. 
The purpose of this study is to find out how the mass media reconstruct the events of fights between residents in the 
city of Belawan, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia. Using a communication management approach, this case study 
research presents information that was not reported in the incident of fighting between residents in Belawan. The 
results of this study indicate that mass media reports on the reality of fights between residents in the city of Belawan, 
North Sumatra Province, Indonesia, have experienced a focus bias between the reality of the media and the reality that 
occurs in the public.

1. Introduction
The mass media in broadcasting information in the form of reconstructing events in the form of words and pictures 
have freedom in the era of press freedom in Indonesia. However, there is a set of press laws that regulate and at the 
same time limit the freedom of the press. In the implementation of press law, violations of the law that occur in the 
news in the mass media have consequences according to the legal instruments that are violated. (Sahputra, 2020). 
However, the practice of journalism, especially in online media or cyber media, is not as simple as the formulation of 
the press law (Nurlatifah, 2018).

4. Conclusion
Incidents of brawls between residents such as what happened in the city of Belawan are common events because they 
also occur in various other regions in Indonesia. The unique thing about the brawl between residents in the city of 
Belawan is that it has been recorded that this event has been going on for about 40 years continuously and is passed 
down from parents to their children. The security forces seemed powerless to solve this case, causing a growing issue 
among the people of the city of Belawan that the brawl was masterminded by the drug mafia as a diversion every time 
drugs entered through the sea in Belawan Port. The issue of the drug mafia behind the brawl between residents is also 
a fact that has occurred in the community of Belawan city. However, in the news they provide, the mass media only 
focus on reporting on brawl events without touching on the issue of the existence of the drug mafia, which is also a 
fact that occurs in the community of Belawan city. In other words, there is a focus bias between the mass media and 
the public in seeing the reality of the brawl between residents in the city of Belawan.

Abstract 
This study aims to find direct and indirect relationships of factors that will influence Hotel Market Performance to fit 
into the dynamic business environment. The research model showed the influence of variables that support Hotel 
Market Performance: property-based resources, knowledge-based resources, dynamic service performance capability, 
and Integrated marketing communication. The data was collected by distributing a survey to 137 Hotel employees 
from 16 Four-Star Hotels based on the Indonesia Stock Exchange data for The Trade, Services, and Investment Sector 
of Service Companies, a subsector of hotels, restaurants & tourism. The data collection technique uses purposive 
sampling. This research model was analyzed with Structural equation modeling by Partial Least Square. The research 
model offers s dynamic service performance capability variables that measure the dynamic capability of employees 
from human resources and marketing perspectives to carry out service performance in their respective fields when the 
hotel environment is not supportive to achieve good hotel performance. Of the five variables studied in this research, 
it was found that in direct relationships two variables were not proven to have a direct impact, namely Property based 
Resources, and Knowledge-Based resources to integrated marketing communication. Meanwhile, in testing the 
indirect relationship of the variables studied, it was found that all variables were proven to be mediated to Hotel market 
performance through Integrated marketing communication.

1. Introduction
The service industry has become a large industry and is one of the important phenomena in Indonesia for the past two 
decades.  The service sector currently accounts for more than 11% of the global GDP. The biggest socio-economic 
impacts felt by this service industry sector are increased employment, improved living standards, greater tax revenues 
to state and local governments, and growth in local retail sales (MacKenzie et al., 2020).  The scope of the service 
industry includes accommodation (hotels), food service, games, cruise lines, travel, etc. The hospitality sector 
contributes significantly to the local and regional economies both directly and indirectly. Directly speaking, it occurs 
when customers spend money on travel, food, and entertainment in exchange for value. When a company purchases

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the world has had an impact on almost all sectors. All countries are trying to 
implement health protocols by shutting the border, seaports, and airports in order to reduce the transmission rate of 
the virus in their country. One of the industries that have had an impact is the cruise ship industry where on early 
February 2020 when the virus began to spread, the first transmission occurred abroad on the Diamond Princess cruise 
ship. Since then, the cruise ship has been suspended globally. After almost a year of trying to discuss with the 
authorities and epidemiologists, a health protocol panel was put in place in order to resume operation during the 
pandemic. This study aims to analyze the effect of perceived value, perceived trust, and perceived service quality on 
behavioral intention and mediated by word-of-mouth for Indonesian cruise passengers. Data was collected using a 
questionnaire method via a google form. The respondents in the research are Indonesian tourists who have traveled 
by cruise ship at least once before the pandemic. The total sample of the study was 253 respondents. The data collected 
were analyzed and tested for hypotheses using SPSS and SEM LISREL. The results of the research with direct effect 
show that perceived value, perceived trust, and perceived service quality have positive and significant relationships 
between word-of-mouth and behavioral intention. For indirect effect show that word-of-mouth has a mediating 
relationship between perceived value, perceived trust, and perceived service quality on behavioral intention. The 
results of this research are beneficial for cruise ship operators, travel agents, academicians, and related parties in 
forming behavioral intentions to travel on cruise ships.

1. Introduction
Influence of globalization has an impact on all developments of businesses including the tourism sector (Dwyer 2015). 
The tourism industry continues to grow and become one of the largest industries in the world as well as the fastest-
growing economy. In the 21st century, the role of the tourism industry is to enhance international relations (Kan et al. 
2021). Tourism activities have become a part of human life with a strategic activity for economic and socio-cultural 
development because tourism activities contribute in creates jobs, increasing people's income in tourist areas, and the 
general economy in a country (Ivanov and Webster 2007). Based on data from the World Travel and Tourism Council 
on the impact of the tourism sector on the economy and employment from 185 countries and 25 geographical areas in 
the world, in 2018 the tourism service industry generated 10.4% of the global GDP (total US$ 9.2 trillion) and 
contributed for 1 in 4 of all new jobs created worldwide 10.6% of all jobs (334 million) while international tourist

Abstract 
With the repercussions of the pandemic continuously affecting the different parts of the world, the emergence of 
varying work arrangements became vital for industries. Implementation of work-from-home, office-based, and a 
combination of both work arrangements are necessary to deal with the restrictions imposed by the government. The 
researchers conducted the study to compare the mental workload of the call center agents among their work 
arrangements. The researchers used Slovin’s Formula to calculate the sample size using a 5% margin of error. For 
assessing the mental workload of the Call Center Agents associated with their work arrangements, the researchers 
utilized the NASA Task Load Index. It is found that the mental workload of work-from-home call center agents is just 
high, with a mean weighted rating of 72.16 compared to the very high mental workload of call center agents working 
office-based and in combined work arrangements, with the mean weighted rating of 77.53 and 79.60, respectively. 
Furthermore, to determine if the work arrangements, types of call center agent, types of service, and work shifts of the 
call center agents have a certain effect on their mental workload, the researchers conducted the Analysis of Variance 
Tests. As a general result, no main effects and significant interaction of all the factors to the call center agents’ mental 
workload were found, thus, combination of all these factors are what makes the mental workload high and very high.

1. Introduction
With the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need not to return to business-as-usual when the 
crisis is over (Gössling et al., 2020). However, it has been almost three years since the pandemic began. The people 
have to adapt to the changes and set new usual ways of living. In the first year, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
in the Philippines was so worst that it landed the country’s GDP at its lowest point since 1947. It could be because the 
spread of the virus infection in that year was quick that it had to restrict businesses from operating and its citizens 
from roaming around the streets. Given the drastic impact on the economy, the government had to find ways to cope 
with the damages. Thus, in 2021, the government gradually calms its restriction down by allowing limited business 
operations done office-based. 
One of the significant industries massively hit by the pandemic is the IT-BPO. It is also one of the industries that 
benefited from the loosened restrictions. They can also be considered a pioneer industry that adapted to the new normal 
in terms of work arrangements flexibility, as they placed their employees and call center agents in a work-from-home 
arrangement. Since the restrictions have loosened up, they were also allowed to operate on-site and enable call center

5. Conclusion 
In the survey conducted, 60% of the call center agents are now working from home, and 31% are still office-based, 
while only 9% are under the work arrangement of the combination of both. Assessment of the mental workload of the 
subjects is conducted through NASA TLX six subscales, namely Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal 
Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration. Combination of both work arrangements yields the highest mental 
workload mean weighted rating of 79.60, followed by office-based work arrangement of 77.53, and finally, work-
from-home with a 72.16 mean weighted rating. The work-from-home arrangement having the lower mental workload 
weighted rating among the three work arrangements proved why 59% of the respondents prefer to have this work 
arrangement. Though no main effects and significant interaction among the MWL weighted rating and other factors 
such as type of call center agents, type of service, work shift, and six subscales are found when compared one by one, 
the collective of these factors are the reason for the high up to the very high mental workload of the agents. 
 
Overall, helping or making the employees like their schedule can be a factor in boosting performance. With that, the 
researchers proposed a working schedule for those who have a combination of both work arrangements, which has 
the highest mental workload. The main recommendation is to at least have one-day office-based and four days of 
work-from-home, from the five days a week normal work schedule, and it’s up to the employees if they want to work 
overtime. This is preferred to alternating work arrangement of office-based and work-from-home weekly because the 
majority of the respondents believe that not all should be present at the company and employees should be scheduled 
accordingly, also to lessen the adverse effects of COVID-19.  
 
5.1 Recommendations 
The study revealed the mental workload of call center agents from the three work arrangements. It has also provided 
test results regarding the status quo of the call center agents among their respective types of service and type of call 
center agent. Thus, the researchers formulated recommendations and are hereby presented: 
 
1. Since most of the respondents prefer working from home, and with the re-arising of COVID-19 cases in the 
Philippines, the management should consider transferring their agents in a remote setup. Moreover, it is also found 
out that the performance of work-from-home call center agents is the highest among the call center agents in all of 
the work arrangements. Furthermore, call center agents working from home have the only ‘high’ level of mental 
workload while the rest have ‘very high’. Additionally, no main effects and interaction between the given factors 
that affect the mental workload of the call center agents have been found out. Thus, there is no reason to primarily 
provide the call center agents a particular work arrangement depending on their type of service and what type of 
call center they have or are, to lessen their mental workload. 
 
2. The provision of complete essential equipment, especially computer sets, working desks, and high-speed internet, 
is highly encouraged to help the call center agents working remotely perform their tasks at a satisfactory level with 
less chance of getting stressed out, frustrated, and anxious. It is also to help lessen the physical demand of working 
from home as it shows on Table 2. As there is no evidence provided in the study showing why even working from 
home is physically demanding, it is recommended for future researchers to further research on this kind of topic 
to amplify the findings of this study. 
 
3. If the management ever wants to push the office-based working arrangement, it will be better if they provide shuttle 
services for its workers. Mass transportation is not enough to accommodate the number of workers working on 
site, and limited passengers are only allowed inside. 
 
4. When opting to provide a combination of work arrangements, the management should provide the specific 
recommendations stated in numbers 2 & 3. Keeping in mind the recommendation stated in the last paragraph of 
the conclusion, which states that having at least 1 day of office-based and 4 days of work-from-home would be the 
most ideal than alternate weekly of work arrangements. 
 
The researchers also adopted some of the recommendations from the study: “Ergonomics Assessment on the Mental 
Workload of Work from Home Employees” of Dasmariñas et al. (2020), as they are also related to the study.

Abstract 
“Practice makes perfect“ is passed around frequently without much evidence to support it. Although there have been 
experiments using mice to test if practice time and maze completion time are correlated, the results cannot directly be 
applied to humans. This experiment uses a custom website that randomly generates different mazes. The participants 
used the arrow keys to navigate through the mazes. Each participant completed four increasingly difficult variations, 
as the function of the arrow keys were changed for each variation. After practicing for a certain amount of time, they 
solved three timed mazes before resuming practice. A two sample t-test determined that participants improved with 
practice, but only for the most difficult variation The experiment also featured participants of ages 8 to 73 to determine 
whether maze completion time would increase with the participant’s age. A linear regression analysis shows that 
younger people generally solved mazes faster than older people.  
Keywords 
Learning, adaptation, practice, cognition, and technology. 
1. Introduction
It is commonly said that as someone practices for a longer duration of time, they become more skilled at the task. For 
experiments that involve simple problem solving and learning ability, researchers often have mice solve mazes. For 
instance, researchers created a circular maze in which the mice had to complete it multiple times. They showed that 
the mice learned and memorized the maze rather quickly (in a few trials), and they completed the maze quicker and 
more efficiently with more practice (Koopmans et al., 2002). However, these findings did not account for different 
ages and access to technology, and cannot be entirely applied to humans.  
The experiment involved human subjects completing mazes using their computer arrow keys. Since each subject 
completed numerous tasks with increasing difficulty, we could determine the effects of practice time depending on 
the task’s complexity. We could answer important questions from this information: Does performance plateau after a 
certain amount of practice time? If someone is already great at a task, can they still marginally improve with more 
practice?   
Furthermore, researchers conducted an experiment to conclude that older people are slower in adapting to a change in 
motor variability (Sosnoff & Newell, 2008). Since the experiment would include participants from 8 to 70 years old, 
we could also determine how age affects performance. Factors like difficulty, practice time, and the participant’s age 
will influence the time to complete a maze. Our prediction is that the maze completion time will increase with 
difficulty, decrease with practice time, and increase with the participant's age.  
1.1 Objectives 
We collected and analyzed data to determine how someone’s maze completion time is affected by three main factors: 
the amount of practice time, the difficulty of the maze, and their age. By grouping the dataset based on these factors, 
I analyzed the trends to see if the participants became better, worse, or stayed the same.  
2. Literature Review
Researchers conducted an observational study to determine the availability and use of home computers for different 
age groups. Their data came from the September 2001 CPS, consisting of 143,300 people (25 years or older) in 56,366

if they encountered maze 21 in their test. Despite the mazes being randomly generated, the participants interestingly 
managed to consistently solve the mazes.  
Figure 6. Possible mazes and their time distribution (strictly for Variation 3) 
Future researchers can also determine if the practice timer should continue running while participants are taking the 
test, since they are still technically practicing. However, this change may create certain complications: slower 
participants may end up practicing longer than other participants, giving them an unfair advantage.  
6. Conclusion
As the complexity of the variations increased, some participants continued to solve the mazes quickly while others 
lagged behind. This explains the increasing variability in more difficult variations as shown in Figure 2. The two 
sample t-tests in Table 1 show that variations 1 and 2 were not much different from each other in terms of difficulty. 
This supports our initial hypothesis that the difficult variations will require more time to complete than the simpler 
ones.  
As displayed in Figure 3, the participants struggled with variation 3 after only one minute of practice. However, they 
quickly adjusted to it after 3 minutes of practice. From this point onwards, a further improvement in the maze 
completion was marginal. Even though the median maze completion time did not improve from 3 to 7 minutes of 
practice, the variability did decrease. This indicates that the participants were consistently performing better as a 
group. These results support our initial hypothesis that participants would become ‘better’ after practicing for longer 
periods of time. My original metric of becoming ‘better’ at solving mazes was the completion time. However, I also 
realized through the experiment that becoming consistent was another metric of measuring ‘better’.  
In Figure 4, the regression fitting indicates that older people performed worse than younger people. This could be 
attributed to younger people being more exposed to technology and able to adapt  more easily to environmental 
changes. In Figure 5, grouping participants by decade increases the R2 value for the polynomial regression. The 
differences within an age group were canceled out, yielding an averaged data point that represented the overall trend 
better. This is especially for participants in their 40s, who had diverse occupations running from house-makers to 
doctors; we suspect that certain occupations prepared the person to adapt to environmental changes while others did 
not. These findings support the initial hypothesis that younger people are better at adapting to a change in variation 
than older people; this does not directly support that younger people are better at technology or adapting to changes. 
However, it can be inferred that there lies some underlying trends that are worth studying.  
All in all, our preconceived notion that there is some negatively correlated relationship between age and adaptability 
to changes were, to some extent, statistically supported through this study. This study also provides support for the 
saying, “Practice makes perfect” when the task was difficult.

Abstract 
In this paper we analyze pricing and capacity allocation decisions in a simple two-class airline revenue management 
scenario using data mining techniques. Our study is based on a lab experiment with a 2x2 between subjects design 
We consider four treatments based on class-1 price being low or high and whether the pricing decision is made solely 
or jointly along with the capacity allocation decision. We study the connection between experiment performance and 
personal factors such as cognitive reflection, maximizing/satisficing tendency, risk-aversion and loss aversion, as well 
as demographic information such as gender and education background. We use data mining techniques such as feature 
selection and cluster analysis.

Abstract 
The target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions led the Indonesian government to set a medium-term action called 
RUEN. For the transportation sector which produces the second largest emission, electric car use was being promoted. 
The government implemented several policies to encourage people to swiftly move from fuel cars to electric cars. 
Since the target achievement of electric car sales is still very low which is around 5%, the author studies the impact 
of policies that have been applied by using the system dynamics method. The government of Indonesia has applied 
policies of tax deduction, tax redemption, and road exemption to attract new electric car users. In this research, author 
finds that policies do not significantly affect sales of electric cars. Considering the target of 132.000 units in 2030, the 
sales of the remaining 8 years need to be drastically increased. It could be done by applying several new policies 
referring to other countries.

1. Introduction
As Indonesia commit a target of a 29% reduction of Green-House-Gas emissions in 2030, the government had 
appointed several actions described in the roadmap called RUEN (Rancangan Umum Energi Menengah). RUEN 
consists of an action plan to reduce GHG emissions and substitute non-renewable energy for renewable energy in 
several sectors such as energy producers, transportation, manufacturing, household, etc. The transportation sector has 
become one of the highlights of GHG emission and renewable energy utilization because it produces the second largest 
emission in 2018 (Laporan Inventarisasi Gas Rumah Kaca dan Monitoring, Pelaporan, Verifikasi tahun 2019, 2019) 
and consumes the largest energy (Handbook of Energy and Economy Statistics of Indonesia, 2020).  
Actions taken on long-term plan (to 2030) in transportation is stimulating to use of biofuel and electric vehicle. Electric 
vehicle use in Indonesia has been started in 2017 for two-wheels and in 2019 for four-wheels. The target for each use 
in 2030 is 398.530 units and 132.983 units (Regulation of Ministry of Industry Number 27 Year 2020, 2020). Both 
achieve very low target, but the electric car was lower which is around 5% on August 2022 (Gaikindo, 2022). As the 
regulator, the government implement policies to encourage Indonesian to use the electric vehicle (EVs). Those are tax 
deductions and non-restriction roads for even odd for the same type of date. It should be pushing electric car numbers 
sold, however by simple calculation reaching 132.938 units in 2030 (which means around 15.000 per year) seems 
difficult. 
Countries in the world have kinds of policies for scaling up the EV market. Several of them are implementing similar 
policies, such as tax deductions or exemptions, no public parking fees, free recharging, etc. Ziegler and Abdelkafi 
(2022) stated that incentives and policies have successfully increased electric car sales in Norway. Because of its 
policies such as tax exemption, no road tolls or public parking fees, and free recharging, there is a large diffusion of 
electric car usage. Referring to other country policies and their effect on car sales, the author studies the impact of 
electric car use policies in Indonesia and whether it is effectively increasing the number of electric car sales. If it 
doesn't have quite an impact, several new policies or adjusting current policies will be needed. In the end, GHG 
emissions could be measured by whether electric car sales had a high impact on reducing GHG emissions.

a. Conventional car sales 
This submodel is initiated by increasing car ownership as GDP and population increase. The level of 
ownership will affect the car demands. The size of the fuel car market share will positively affect the number 
of fuel car sales. The fuel car market share is influenced by the size of the electric car market share. 
 
b. Electric car sales 
This submodel also describes the relationship between the demand and market share to the number of electric 
car sales. The electric car market share is influenced by the total cost of fuel cars and usage utilities. The 
number of sales of electric cars obtained will positively affect the production of electricity that must be 
generated and negatively affect vehicle emissions. Electricity production will later emit positive emissions 
or add to GHG emissions. Conversely, vehicle emissions will negatively affect or reduce the resulting GHG 
emissions. 
 
Based on the literature, the main reasons for the decision to use an electric car are cost, government subsidies, and 
considerations in the ease of charging. Subsidies in Indonesia that are currently running are purchase tax breaks, annual 
tax breaks, and exemptions in the odd-even rule on the highway. In this study it is assumed that consumers can choose 
three decisions in buying a vehicle, namely buying an electric car, a conventional car, or not buying a car. This is 
discussed in Liu's research (2017). Liu stated that consumers' ability to buy a car is determined by the main factors 
previously described. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
The author analyzes dependencies between factor and result was explained below: 
a. 
Gross domestic product is highly related to car sales. The growth of GDP will directly affect the buying 
ability of people. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia has the largest population, however because of GDP amount 
is low, vehicle ownership in Indonesia is lower than in Brunei and Malaysia. The government stated that they 
are aiming to increase vehicle ownership from 99 to 100 per 1000 people. 
b. Fuel price is not highly related to electric car sales. Increasing fuel prices will not affect electric car sales 
significantly. This is due to high cost of electric car. 
c. 
Electric car price is not highly related to electric car sales. It is because the electric car needs battery 
replacement, a factor that fuel car doesn’t have. Besides, the utility of charging stations is still a consideration 
for buying an electric car. 
d. Utility of charging stations is quite related to electric car sales. As today the availability of charging stations 
is still very low, it is needed to increase the number dramatically to affect the willingness of people to buy 
an electric car. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The intention of reducing GHG emissions by using electric cars has many challenges in developing countries. The 
government of Indonesia has applied policies of tax deduction, tax redemption, and road exemption to attract new 
electric car users. However, these policies need to study deeper, as the author finds that it does not significantly affect 
sales. Considering the target of 132.000 units in 2030, the sales of the remaining 8 years need to be drastically 
increased. It could be done by applying several new policies referring to other countries. The author suggests that 
further research could dig deeper into another commercial factor that might attract the new user.

Abstract 
Using local resources, food processing experts have focused on functional food research for stunting prevention since 
2018. This is intended to aid the government's stunting prevention initiatives, with a focus on nutritional therapies for 
infants and toddlers. The purpose of this study is to produce an appropriate description and set of recommendations 
for the distribution management of Institution X's revolutionary functional food items created for stunting prevention. 
This study employs a qualitative approach with a case study design to explain field data about the management of 
functional food dissemination developed by Institution X to combat stunting. This study illustrates the necessity of 
researchers collaborating from the onset with health practitioners specializing in stunting prevention and industry to 
identify the most effective local resources for functional food stunting. To attain toddler nutritional adequacy, 
Institution X and the government must distribute regionally appropriate functional food product innovations, 
particularly those based on animal protein. To maximize strategic measures so that the affordability of intake or use 
of functional meals to avoid stunting are directly on target, it is necessary to consider many factors, including the 
actors involved and the informational media.

1. Introduction
Diverse nations are attempting to enhance the nutritional state of their populations, which has a substantial impact on the 
future readiness and quality of their human resources. According to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report (2018), there are 
three nutritional problems: stunting affects 22.2% of children under the age of five globally (150,8 million), wasting 
affects 7.5% (50,5 million), and obesity affects 5.6%. (38.3 million). Indonesia is one of the nations with a triple-double 
of nutritional issues, notably the nutritional status of children under the age of five, which causes stunting (Rokx, et al, 
2018). The importance of stunting to Indonesians stems from its connection to government activities. Indonesia is rated 
second in ASEAN in terms of the prevalence of stunting, with a rate of 31.8%, after Timor-Leste, which has a rate of 
48.0%. This is to ensure that future human resources will be of the highest quality (Katadata, 2021).  
In Indonesia, stunting in children under the age of five is caused by a deficiency in calories, protein, and micronutrients 
in pregnant mothers, which leads to anemia in their offspring. Stunting is a result of the community's poor dietary habits, 
particularly among pregnant women and young children. This is influenced by the diet of the Indonesian people, as 
evidenced by 2017 Ministry of Agriculture data (Ministry of Agriculture's Food Security Agency, 2018) indicating that 
grains continue to dominate the Indonesian population's food consumption, while consumption of animal protein, 
vegetables, and fruits remains low. Even according to Riskesdas data from 2018 (Team Riskesdas, 2018), only 95.5% of 
the population aged 5 years consumed vegetables and fruits. 
1.1 Objectives 
As a government research institute, Institution X also supports and assists the government in its efforts to reduce the 
prevalence of stunting among Indonesian children under the age of five by designing functional diets utilizing local 
resources. Through INSINAS 2018-2020, Institution X will receive financing from the Ministry of Research,

not only the development of these commodities but also the social realm. This pertains to interventions in cases of 
stunting, including sensitive and particular nutrition interventions that need changes in parenting habits to offer healthy 
meals for their families.  
 
Beyond mocaf and bananas, the development of functional foods for stunting prevention must be expanded. IDAI 
refers to the WHO's guidelines for feeding infants and toddlers a range of foods to meet their nutritional needs, namely: 
meat, poultry, fish, and eggs should be consumed daily, or as frequently as possible. Vegetarian diets cannot provide 
nutritional needs at this age without nutritional supplements or fortified foods. This is based on the problem of stunting 
resulting from a chronic protein-energy deficiency in children with 1000 HPK. Consequently, institution X must place 
a greater emphasis on functional foods for teenagers, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and infants aged 6–23 
months that are adapted to food sources with high nutritional content, such as carbs, proteins, and fats. In addition, it 
must examine the adequacy of the volume, variation, and schedule or frequency of giving nutritious meals, particularly 
to infants receiving complementary foods. Stunting is a persistent protein-energy deficiency that requires additional 
protein and micronutrients. To prevent Institution X's functional food, it is required to design functional food based 
on animal protein (livestock, poultry, and marine items) that is rich in nutrients and easily absorbed by the body. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Based on the findings of this study, it is possible to conclude that cultural changes in the behavior of pregnant women, 
infants, and toddlers (focused on the first 1000 days of life/HPK), particularly the consumption of animal protein, 
should be the primary focus for preventing stunting. Various research sources about the treatment of malnutrition, 
particularly stunting, include the consumption of food with a balanced nutritional value, particularly in animal protein, 
as Peru has succeeded in reducing the prevalence of stunting with a program requiring the daily consumption of at 
least one egg during the first 1000 days of life/HPK. The stunting management program can more precisely refer to 
prior research sources, allowing for faster implementation of initiatives to reduce the prevalence of stunting. Moreover, 
numerous government entities play significant roles in the multisectoral reduction of stunting. Through functional 
food research, Institution X, an Indonesian research institution, also helps to the government's attempts to minimize 
the prevalence of stunting.  
 
According to the conclusions of this study, institution X should place a greater emphasis on functional and 
complementary diets for adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, and toddlers. The research on functional 
foods conducted by Institution X to prevent stunting should pay close attention to the functional food classification. It 
must be modified so that the texture, variety, flavor, and amount conform to the nutritional adequacy rate value. 
The emphasis should be switched from generating functional foods from local resources to including or utilizing those 
generated from animal protein. The sources of animal protein are livestock, poultry, fish, and seafood. This is because 
animal protein includes nutrients that are more readily absorbed by the body than those found in plant-based foods. 
Children, especially newborns and toddlers, have a higher protein requirement than adults.  
 
The focus of the study on functional foods is on teenagers and pregnant women, particularly food sources that can 
prevent anemia, such as iron and folic acid, zinc, calcium, etc. There is a substantial possibility for research on the 
nutritional value of marine items, including fish and others, which can be employed as a food source to prevent 
stunting.  
 
Institution X must work with industry from the outset to profit from its research products and mass-produce them for 
stunting prevention efforts. Institution X is required to engage with various associations, professions, or health 
advocacy groups concentrating on stunting prevention. Additionally, Institution X must actively educate the public on 
stunting facts to market its research products. There is a need for institution X to actively participate in stunting 
prevention efforts through various media to introduce research products that are easily accessible to the public via 
social media. The necessity for institution X to aggressively engage with other governments, such as the Ministry of 
Health with Puskesmas and Posyandu, to aid in the prevention of stunting through research products. This research is 
constrained by the limited time available for data collection. Researchers have a hurdle due to the lack of integrated 
information data regarding research and research progress.

Abstract 
Engineering Management (EM) has a long history in Australia as far back as 1968. However, a review of scholarly 
papers has revealed a lack of attention from researchers for this discipline in the past 10 years, especially topics 
about industrial demand and competency. This paper is to provide a review of current EM practices in Australia, 
classified into Occupation and Market demand, Professional Society, and Required Qualifications and 
Competency. A review of EM practices in Australia has been conducted through 24 scholarly papers from 1991 
to 2022 along with a statistical analysis of data from government and professional society. The review has revealed 
the increasing market demand for engineering managers (EMers). Temporary and permanent visa has been offered 
since 2005 and 2012 respectively to fill the gap in the domestic market. The EM career path with required years 
of experience and the trend of qualifications are also synthesized from different research and data. Different from 
the US, Australia is lacking a professional society that is dedicated to the management and promotion of this 
discipline in the country. EM competency is currently defined by Engineers Australia (EA) only for migration 
purposes.  The paper raises the awareness of management skills for all engineers on their engineering career path. 
This paper also provides implications for strategic plans, particularly for educational institutions in developing 
engineering management programs. Further, recommendations for future research directions are outlined. This is 
the first literature review paper on EM practices in Australia.  
Keywords 
Occupation, Career Path, Competency, Education, Professional Society. 
1. Background
In Australia, EM is found as far back as 1968 with the definition of the coupling of management with technical 
work (Lloyd, 1968). Nationwide, since the 1980s, the role of management has been confirmed to play a vital role 
in practice for professional engineers (Young, 1986) and to be a requirement for all engineering activities (Young, 
1987b). The role of EM education in Australia has been mentioned to prepare engineers to further steps in their 
career path to leadership and managerial roles since 1986 (Young, 1987b).  
Given the long history of EM in Australia, the researchers have conducted a literature review on scholarly papers 
about EM practices in Australia.  
1.1. Literature Review Process and Results 
The literature review process commences with articles that are located at the intersection of Engineering 
Management/Engineering Manager and Australia until the date. Articles are gathered based on searching titles, 
abstracts, and keywords. The papers are classified into different themes as described in Figure 1.

culture in North America with its extensive postgraduate studies and research in EM is mentioned to be extremely 
beneficial for the Australian profession (Lloyd, 1991). ABET develops the accreditation guidelines for all EM 
programs based on suggestions for changes by ASEM and by the Engineering Management Division of the 
American Society for Engineering Education (Wiebe and Babcock, 1989). Furthermore, the CAEM® and 
CPEM® certification is mentioned to be global with EMers working around the globe. A new collaboration with 
ASEM for using use global professional standards to certify MEM and professional certifications would benefit 
the EM community in Australia.  
 
3.3. Future research 
The literature review has indicated the gap in recent research to investigate EM practices in Australia. Broad-scale 
surveys with current EMers would provide an insight into EM current practices as well as emerging competency 
and skills in the era of data and industry 4.0. This would predict the future of EM skills as well as develop 
implications for education and training. 
 
Furthermore, research on EM in times of crisis and the future will also be beneficial for professional engineers to 
prepare to ensure a smooth transition into the new changing workplace and role.  
 
4. Conclusion 
This paper has filled the gap of a review paper on EM practices in Australia. The data has revealed the high 
demand for this occupation in the market with the solution of the temporary and permanent visas for EMers to 
bridge this gap. The career path with the requirements of qualification and experience years is also analysed with 
the results of the dominance of higher education, the average year of 6.5 -8.3 years in engineering roles and 20 
years in management roles. Furthermore, the EM skills are also analysed by reviewing the competency 
requirements from a professional society. 
 
The paper ends with recommendations for strategic plans for educational institutions in developing EM programs 
at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. A suggestion of a professional society in collaboration with other 
international association to leverage EM society in Australia is also provided. Last but not least is the directions 
for future research with the need of broad-scale research on the current practices and future of the EM discipline.

Abstract 
The Control Chart Patterns Recognition (CCPR) is one of important tools in Statistical Process Control (SPC). The 
performance of CCPR depend on many factors, one of those the prediction algorithm. Furthermore, when data is 
substantially missing, the rate of false alarms and misclassification is high. This paper reported an investigation of 
five classifiers namely, Decision Tree, ANN, Linear Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Support Vector Machine, and 
KNN-5 with ensemble classifier.  The results are compared with perfect sample pattern (without missing data) and 
sample patterns with missing data 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. Two datasets having normal ± 3σ shifting 
range, and small shifting range less than ± 1.5σ was investigated. The results show that the ensemble classifier have 
higher recognition accuracy for sample patterns without missing data 99.55% and 98.64% for sample patterns with 
20% missing data.

1. Introduction
The missing in a dataset occurs for many reasons, such as equipment malfunction, incomplete responses, operator 
errors, sensor errors, and data entry errors. For missing value data imputation, single and multiple data imputation 
have been developed. The missing data issues attracted many researchers to study this problem to find a robust 
approach to handle such data (Haghighati and Hassan 2019, Pauzi et al. 2021). The state of art research increased the 
accuracy of monitoring the process variations by using many helpful techniques for controlling process differences. 
In control chart pattern recognition, facing some missing data or missing individual observation within a sample often 
happens for many reasons.  Like human error, equipment malfunctioning, data transmission faulty, and all those effects 
of the sample do not get a good representation of data, whether the input data is raw data or features-based. For that 
reason, it is important to handle this missing data in CCPs to get the real presented data for each type of pattern. In 
literature, some researchers studied this issue and proposed many approaches. Some of them ignored the missing data, 
and in this case, it will get the data not complete to represent the process. Other researchers suggest techniques to 
handle this missing data like Mahmoud et al. (2014) argues that the effect of four imputation methods, namely 
stochastic regression, mean imputation, the expectation-maximization algorithm, and regression for estimating Phase 
I historical data set in control charts, and then estimated the unknown parameters in the Hotelling's T2 chart statistic. 
They showed that the stochastic regression approach outperformed all other competing methods in terms of overall 
performance. Haghighati and Hassan (2019) suggests that an imputation technique based on EWMA its best way to 
handle missing data. 
Haghighati and Hassan (2018) evaluated the usefulness of exponential smoothing in recovering patterns in order to 
improve recognition accuracy in CCPR with incomplete data. The results showed that with extreme missingness, total

4. Conclusion
The ensemble classifier has the capability to get higher recognition accuracy compare with individual classifier. This 
paper investigated several missing data percentages for two dataset namely normal shifting range for mean (±3σ) and 
small shifting range for mean less than ((±1.5σ). The recognition accuracy without missing data 99.55% with ensemble 
classifier when it is 98.64% with 20% missing data for normal shifting range and 93.69 within small shift range in 
mean. The ensemble classifier can achieve higher recognition accuracy within missing data better than individual 
classifiers which used in previous studies. The EWMA computation to compensation the missing data it is better than 
another computation methods. The proposed method can handle the missing data with 50% missing data and the 
recognition accuracy still over 94%. For the future wark we suggest to investigate another classifier algorithms with 
ensemble classifier and investigate missing data in CCPR with data lees than 1.0 Sigma.

Abstract 
Utilizing renewable energy (RE) to minimize the use of fossil fuels is an emerging concept throughout the globe to 
attain energy sufficiency while reducing the negative impact on the environment. Since the existing infrastructures 
and concepts of energy consumption stand on burning fossil fuels for hundreds of years, ideas for replacing those by 
implementing RE often stumble with several barriers, especially in developing countries where there are numerous 
resource constraints. These barriers create critical policymaking challenges to achieving comprehensive energy 
sustainability. Several studies discovered the challenges to utilizing RE in the context of developing nations. However, 
no study has yet been conducted to prioritize the challenges and examine the relations among them. This study, 
thereby, utilizes the decision-making trial, and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to identify the 
prioritization, and examine the relations among the critical challenges to utilizing RE in the context of developing 
countries. Thirteen challenges were identified from reviewing literature and expert feedback, which were then 
analyzed by the DEMATEL method. The findings revealed that ‘Large land requirement’, ‘Uncertain supply’, and 
‘End life management difficulties’ are the three most prominent challenges to utilizing RE in developing countries. 
The explored cause-effect relations among the challenges indicate ‘Long economic recovery periods’ to be the most 
causative and ‘Lack of social awareness and acceptance’ to be the least causative challenge. This study is expected to 
assist the policymakers of developing nations in successfully utilizing RE sources to achieve long-term energy 
sustainability, thus achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs).

1. Introduction
Energy scarcity has already become one of the most challenging issues to overcome all over the world, which is going 
to be more severe in the upcoming years (Mahmud et al., 2021). This challenge becomes even further critical when 
global warming due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from burning fossil fuels is taken into consideration (Moorthy 
et al., 2019). Researchers and practitioners have been thinking about utilizing RE because of its diverse benefits over 
fossil fuels for a long ago. United Nations (UN) SDGs since 2015 for a better world to live in by ensuring both social 
and environmental sustainability mobilize global and local policymakers to this idea as well (Bertheau, 2020).

Abstract 
The readiness of military defense radar is absolute in effort to maintain Indonesia air sovereignty from potential threats 
that may enter and endanger the security of citizens and residents throughout Indonesia territory. Currently, the radar 
health condition monitoring system has not been integrated in a whole system integrated manner between the 
subsystems each other, it causes a relatively long time to identify critical failures that may arise in the related 
subsystems. Prognostics and health management (PHM) takes the current state of the system as a starting point, 
combined with structural characteristics, parameters, environmental conditions, and historical data of objects, to 
monitor the equipment working status with various knowledge, algorithms, and models based on advances in sensor 
acquisition technology. PHM on MASTER-T radar maintenance is proposed using the method of failure mode effect 
and criticality analysis (FMECA) which aims to predict critical failures, thus preventing fatal damage that can result 
in system breakdown. Predictive maintenance is added to conventional maintenance, thereby minimizing idle time 
when repairs must be made with the radar system inactive. The application of this method obtains a risk priority 
number (RPN) which is used as a reference in determining critical components that must be repaired immediately.

1. Introduction
The radar system operation in monitoring the air situation becomes very crucial in the presence of a sovereignty threat, 
it means the level of radar readiness must be maintained and system performance must always be monitored (Wang 
et al. 2020). The radar system is a complex electronics information system that has an important role in national air 
defense (Lyu et al. 2020). Nowadays, the advancement of radar related to technological developments, the level of

From Figure 6 it can be understood that the main things that need to be considered by technicians on the PHM display 
screen are the “Top Critical Info” table and the Graphs of subsystem health conditions. The “Top critical info” table 
provides predictive information on priority critical items that need to be aware for checking according to the subsystem 
grouping. The subsystem health condition graph shows the subsystem health condition status in general as a 
consideration for radar system maintenance measures from time to time. The columns for each subsystem on the left 
side of the PHM display provide additional information on the priority of risks for each subsystem. 
 
The PHM framework provides further information on the detected RUL subsystems or components, making it easier 
for technicians to take maintenance actions that will be carried out based on the remaining life time of the equipment 
before a critical failure occurs. The predictive maintenance built by PHM finally helps technicians in repairing the 
radar system in efficient manner time, effort, and cost, without interfering with the replacement of other equipment 
that does not experience significant problems, so the use of each equipment or subsystem can be used to its full 
potential, and the life of the system radar becomes longer.  
 
4. Conclusion 
PHM with FMECA method on MASTER-T radar maintenance develops a more advanced maintenance from 
conventional maintenance into predictive maintenance, able to predict potential critical failures to prevent fatal 
damage on the system. Prognostics on monitoring the entire radar system provides RUL information for each 
subsystem, so that it can determine equipment maintenance time before system breakdown occurs and extend its 
service life as a long-term goal. The simulation shown can make the difference to the overall health monitoring of the 
radar system more quickly to technicians and operators in the hope of helping make decisions about the series of 
maintenance actions that must be done immediately. The prototype of the health monitoring model that is designed 
can be used as an initial step to determine the maintenance and repair priority of the affected subsystems according to 
the order of the RPN value is that appear in the monitoring system. As an example, in the paper when diesel engine 
item that has an RPN value of 300 (the highest at certain time) is anticipated from failure, fatal damage to the radar 
system and the radar crew can be avoided, and the operational time of the radar system can continue to last longer. 
The FMECA method can provide priority calculations of critical failures that must be done immediately, the

application of PHM as data management on the system health status can provide information on the right time to carry 
out maintenance to extend the service life. 
Future Work 
The development of the security of its information management system which still uses standard security and 
monitoring development data that is not yet fully from the system directly, and the development of PHM for system 
optimization on other radar systems is a development plan for future studies. Future work on this study is very open 
to many possible collaborations with other maintenance technologies.

Abstract 
This study aims to examine the Competence of Human Resources as a liaison of the influence of strategic planning 
on company performance. This research is a research with primary data based on a questionnaire distributed to the 
leadership of Regional Water Company in Indonesia. The sampling was carried out randomly with representatives of 
each region from PDAM in Indonesia, the sample, research consisted of 61 samples representing the four regions. The 
analysis method used was smart PLS. The results of this study indicate that HR competence has a strong relationship 
in influencing strategic planning on company performance 
Keywords 
HR Competence, Strategic Planning, and Company Performance. 
1. Introduction
Having good company performance is something that is highly expected for a company because good company 
performance has an impact on the sustainability and sustainability of the company. That is why various efforts and 
strategies are carried out by the company's management to improve company performance. The results of work or 
performance need to be measured so that the company knows where the achievements have reached with existing 
resources. Proper performance measurement will increase the ""value"" for the company (Nazaruddin, 2000). 
Performance is an effort made to produce achievements from things that have been done before, performance means 
understanding what is being done and how to do it. For this reason, competent human resources are needed following 
the fields of expertise and fields needed. Strategy is determining the right human resources is a factor that affects 
performance. Proper management of human resources has a positive influence on company performance (Iskandar, 
2018; Mora,  et al., 2020). Competent human resources have a very important role to support the improvement and 
achievement of company performance. Organizations that are dynamic and have competitive human resources are 
urgent things that must be considered by companies (Latief, et al., 2019; Syardiansah, et al., 2020; Suharyanto, et al., 
2020). 
The management of existing resources in the company as well as possible (efficient and effective) following the goals 
set by the company will greatly affect the company's performance (Hernendiastoro, 2005), the same thing was also 
conveyed by Siahaan, (2017) which states that the level of efficiency and competence of human resources has a 
positive effect on the company's performance, but the equity participation does not affect the company's performance. 
Efficiency measurement can be done if the company has a good planning. Strategic planning is a guide for companies 
in carrying out their activities. However, many companies do not have a good and clear strategic plan, even though 
from the strategic plan we will be able to analyze and evaluate what has been and will be done next. The better the 
strategic planning of a company, the better the company's performance, which in turn will be able to create a 
competitive advantage (Asmarani and Estika, 2006; Hidajat et al., 2021).. Increasing competitive advantage requires

The results of this study indicate that the first hypothesis answered, that there is an effect of strategic planning on the 
company's performance with an at-count value of 6.718 while the t-table is 1.96. This shows that to get good work 
results to need good planning as well. Planning is a guide that is used as a guide for all components of the organization 
to achieve goals. The vision and mission as well as the company's goals are important to be determined and known by 
all parties involved in improving the company's performance, but evaluation of external opportunities and threats must 
also be a priority for management to do. Sometimes the monopoly that seems to be a strength for the PDAM will 
become a threat because the PDAM ignores the innovation and creativity that should continue to be carried out. Feeling 
that they have no competitors, PDAM forgets to evaluate the company's external developments. Currently, people are 
increasingly understanding the importance of clean water that is safe to drink with quality that meets health standards. 
The providers of healthy clean water treatment machines are starting to target consumers who are already aware of 
the benefits of clean water and the risks that will be accepted if the water consumed so far is not fit for drinking. The 
percentage may not be large compared to the number of PDAM customers that are currently registered, it is not 
impossible that in the future the community will only have to pay a subscription for the water account they use because 
they mostly use water that has been treated with machines even though the price is more expensive than the account 
payment. PDAM bill. This situation is of course very concerning. If more and more people are aware of the importance 
of clean water, then their financial inability will try to buy a machine even though they have to go into debt. Therefore, 
PDAM needs to evaluate the opportunities and threats to improving future planning. 
5. Conclusion
Organizational effectiveness is also a concern in planning, the length of bureaucracy in the services provided by 
PDAM stems from the ineffectiveness of the existing organizational structure. PDAM can use a simple organizational 
structure in Top Management but enlarge the responsibility at the technical level. PDAM should continuously evaluate 
opportunities and threats to improve future planning.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine and explain the uses and effects of FB, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp Social Media 
for students of Muhammadiyah High School in North Sumatra. This type of research uses a qualitative approach with 
in-depth and direct interviews with students. This study is the uses and effects theory. The problem that arises in this 
study is how students of SMA Muhammadiyah North Sumatra use social media. Do they have a long enough frequency 
in social media? Are they affected by various social media content? Do they use social media to increase religious 
knowledge? What content do they follow on social media? Findings in the field show that, on average, they use social 
media 8-10 hours for the day, so it is not uncommon for social media content also to influence their behavior. It is 
known that not infrequently, they also use social media to increase religious knowledge because of their school 
background so that the contents of the recitation become references.

1. Introduction.
The development of social media is increasing rapidly, even to a necessity of life. In 1997, this social media was born 
based on trust, but starting in the 2000s until the following year, social media began to attract everyone's attention 
until it reached its heyday. The development of social media makes the performance faster, more precise, accurate to 
increase the resulting productivity. In this era of globalization, technology is increasingly advanced, it is undeniable 
that the presence of the internet is increasingly needed in everyday life, both in socialization activities, education, 
business, etc. It is undeniable that social media has a great influence in one's life. Someone who is initially small can 
become big with social media, or vice versa. For the community, especially teenagers, social media has become an 
addiction that makes users no day without opening social media. Whereas in its development period, in school, 
teenagers try to find their identity by hanging out with their peers.  
Social media has now become a trend in communication in society. Social media is an online medium, with its users 
being able to easily participate, share, and create content including blogs, social networks, wikis, forums and virtual 
worlds. Blogs, social networks, and wikis are the most common forms of social media used by people around the 
world. Social media is defined as “a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and 
technological foundations of Web 2.0, and which enable the creation and exchange of user-generated content” (Kaplan 
and Haenlein, 2010). Various social media platforms are Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, Path, Tumblr, and 
other social media. One of the current social media users is a student because by using social media, students can 
easily communicate near and long distances without having to meet face-to-face or meet (Figure 1).

Type of Change 
Uses and Effect 
1 
Cognitive 
The cognitive abilities of these students had increased due to the large number of sources 
of knowledge received from social media without any limitations to be obtained 
2 
Affective 
The affective ability of ignorant adolescents, and tends not to care about real social 
interactions, even having difficulty interacting with each other.  
This creates an indifferent attitude in the daily lives of these teenagers. 
3 
Psychomotor 
The psychomotor effect also makes teenagers less active in their activities.  
Movement is often a problem for the environment, seeing these teenagers find it difficult 
to move from their everyday gadgets into their hands. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that; Students use social media for self-actualization and visualization. The frequency of accessing 
social media depends on the ownership of the gadget and the available facilities, but on average, they use 20 hours 
per day. The positive impact of using social media is facilitating communication between students and teachers; as a 
learning tool and looking for learning reference sources, including religious knowledge enhancers. On the other hand, 
the negative impact of using social media is students' addiction to harmful content and creating negative issues.

Abstract 
This research is motivated by catcalling activity that commonly happened in Universitas Medan Area environment. 
Catcalling activity leads to a various perception of students. However some of them thought that catcalling was not a 
form of sexual harrashment. Otherwise, many of students thought that catcalling was a dissrespectfull behavior. The 
purpose of this research is to understand the students of Universitas Medan Area perceptions about catcalling activity 
and as well as any of the factors behind it. This research was conducted at Universitas Medan Area and the method of 
this research was qualitative descriptive. This research used S-O-R theory and semiotic theory of Charles Sanders 
Pierce. Data collected method of this research was interviews and observations. The result of this research shows that 
man and woman both can be a victims and perpetrator of catcalling and the various response towards catcalling activity 
like some of the subject feels outrage and bravely against the perpetrator and some of them not even care if being 
catcalled and also some of them are happy being treated or catcalled that way by stranger.

1. Introduction
One way humans interact with other humans is to communicate, both verbally and non-verbally. Communication is a 
very important aspect used in socializing with the social environment which is usually done face-to-face directly 
between the communicator and the communicant. In interacting with the surrounding environment, it is not uncommon 
for someone to use communication to attract the opposite sex. Communication becomes something important when 
someone wants to start a relationship with another person. In this case a person's desire to communicate with the 
opposite sex is sometimes carried out in an inappropriate way and even makes a person feel uncomfortable. 
Ways that often make someone feel uncomfortable when receiving messages from other people are by whistling, 
teasing and commenting using sexually explicit words. When someone feels uncomfortable with verbal 
communication with sexual tendencies made by others and considers that it is inappropriate to do so, then the act can

the catcalling action, the stimulus given by the communicator (catcalling actor) to the communicant (catcalling victim) 
is in the form of whistling sounds, calls and some even give a wink and finger heart. Each informant gave a different 
response to the catcalling treatment that had been received. Some responded in an angry way and went straight to the 
perpetrator, some responded casually and some felt happy when they got the catcalling treatment. In this study, the 
authors found several signs used in carrying out catcalling actions, namely icons (finger heart), index (eye scanning, 
winking) and symbols (whistles). Each informant interprets the signs they receive differently. There are those who 
think that the sign is intended because of an attachment to body shape, there are those who interpret the sign as an 
invitation to sexuality and there are also those who consider the sign as a form of coquetry and temptation to one's 
appearance. The factors behind the occurrence of catcalling activities in the Medan Area University campus. The 
results of this study indicate that the motive or background of the catcalling activity that often occurs in the Medan 
Area University campus is purely for fun. If viewed from the perspective of the perpetrators, the reason they did the 
catcalling action was for fun, wanting to entertain themselves, wanting to be noticed and wanting to get acquainted. 
However, when viewed from the side of the victim, the victim feels that his appearance is what triggers someone to 
do catcalling. In this study, students at the University of Medan Area also considered that catcalling was something 
that was commonplace to do. Many of these students and college students do not know the term catcalling as verbal 
sexual harassment so they feel they don't care and consider it a normal thing to do.

higher level of job satisfaction, work engagement and organizational commitment, the lower the turnover intention 
among employees. Organization also are advised to practice open-door policy in order to ensure employee at all level 
can freely communicate with the manager. Open or two-way communication should be created between employee 
and management. In other way, organization also should involve employee in every decision-making process. As a 
result, the employees will give their full of commitment and engaged with the organization if they are invited to share 
their opinions and ideas. Indirectly, it will stir the sense of belongingness to the job and the organization. As supported 
by, developing a better communication among the employees can create positive organizational climate such as 
increase level of trust, good communication, and cooperation. In addition, organization should also enhance work 
engagement level in order to reduce turnover intention. Like study stated that manager can develop mechanisms on a 
regular basis for measuring the work engagement level on at least to the key employees. Thus, this measurement 
finding will assist organizations to distinguish the current employee work engagement level followed by corrective 
actions wherever and whenever needed.Through interviews conducted at UD. TITO Medan, the researcher concluded 
that job satisfaction is the feeling of pleasure and achievement that the employees experience in their job and when 
they know that their work is worth doing. 
 
Through interview that has been conducted at UD. TITO Medan, it can be known that the employee feels that low 
incentive, less reward for the employee achievement and company delayed their incentive. The employs are quite 
passive in expressing idea, this is showed that the employee have a low level of job. The coordination between superior 
and subordinate is not good because they are lack of process communication. This is also showed that the employee’s 
job satisfaction is not good.

1. Introduction
Public service management in the context of a modern state is an important part of the presence of the state during 
people's lives (Mukarom & Laksana, 2015). The public can be interpreted broadly in various aspects of life. In general, 
the meaning to the public is often related to the basic rights of citizens, such as administrative matters. Whereas public 
service is also related to the recognition of human existence and expression in culture (Curry, 1999). 
So far, public services are synonymous with services provided by state apparatus at various levels and fields for the 
needs of the wider community related to certain fields (Afrizal & Sahuri, 2013). In Indonesia, the issue of public 
services, especially those related to culture, shows how the state views cultural and artistic issues as being part of the 
public that does not receive wide attention (Dwiyanto, 2017). 
Almost every region has a variety of types of regional art, so you can imagine, many types of art later became the 
characteristics of the area. Art is part of the culture which is a means to pass on the existing culture to the next 
generation (Nugroho, 2016). 
Art as part of the culture becomes a means to express a sense of beauty from within the human soul, this can be seen 
in various arts that are developing in the present. Art can also determine norms for regular behavior and transmit

Abstract 
Modern manufacturing technologies such as Additive Manufacturing are a vital pillar of Industry 4.0 and Smart 
Manufacturing systems. One of the most promising AM techniques is Directed Energy Deposition (DED) which uses 
a thermal source to generate a melt pool on a substrate into which metal powder is injected. Laser Cladding (LC), a 
DED additive process, is widely used in machine parts repair and functional coating due to its advantages, such as the 
low heat input into the substrate. Compared to conventional welding, this results in less induced stress, lower dilution 
rate, small heat-affected zone, and good metallurgical bonding between the coating and the substrate. The LC 
technology is not as robust or standardized. The part quality, mechanical properties, and microstructure of Laser-
Cladded parts are neither as commercially predictable nor controllable. This research aims to develop Deep Learning 
models that predict and classify the LC process for LC coating and single and interfering-bead samples. The ML 
models will detect faulty process input parameters and predict the quality. This detection and prediction take place in 
real time, which is vital in producing the additive process’s data model component of a Digital Twin (DT). Digital 
imaging of a coaxial CMOS camera and melted pool temperature measurements using a LASCON LPC04 pyrometer 
are being used as in-situ sensory devices. A plethora of articles have limited their ML models to individual 
combinations of substrate and powder and focused on the three main process parameters (laser power, laser beam 
scanning speed, and Powder feeding rate). This research project expands the scope to include a different substrate and 
powder combinations, utilize additional parameters, and exploit different powder/substrate combinations. The Inputs

Abstract 
Those in charge of directing small and micro companies many see the application of improvement tools as something 
unnecessary; since, they think that they are complicated development methods that will represent unnecessary expense 
of time and money, and therefore they prefer to remain in the same situation and do not take advantage of the 
possibility of improving and growing as an organization. In the development of this research, the influence of the 
application of the Six Sigma methodology is studied and approached in a practical way; tool that allows to measure 
the performance of a process for the identification of defects and determine the ideal improvements to apply, in a 
MYPE. Different articles were analyzed, where the Six Sigma model had been applied; which presented improvements 
for the organizations to which they were directed. In addition, the Six Sigma methodology was implemented in a 
MYPE that provided the car wash service; whose process initially had a non-optimal performance, but by 
implementing the Six Sigma method, improvements were achieved such as: the increase in the availability of the 
pressure washer machine from 84.31% to 92.78%, the increase in the number of vehicles washed, reduction of 122 
hours stopped for maintenance and reduction of rejected vehicles.

1. Introduction
In Peru, small and micro companies have an important participation in favor of the national economy, which represent 
95% of the business structure that contribute approximately 40% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). 
MYPES (Small and Medium Enterprises) are valued in many countries as sources of job creation, social inclusion, 
competitiveness and the fight against poverty. However, many micro and small entrepreneurs tend to close their 
businesses because they cannot adapt to the changes that constantly occur in the markets or because of poor 
management that generates low productivity. Therefore, the implementation of the Six Sigma tool in an MYPE allows 
productivity to be optimized, eliminating and reducing process failures (Paprocka et al., 2020). 
The Six Sigma methodology, which was developed in the 1980s by the Motorola company, is considered a 
multidimensional strategy that consists of a set of disciplined processes. These allow the development of products and 
services optimally for customers; its implementation and development are based on an exact compilation of process 
data that is analyzed and is intended to be improved, reducing waste, defects and process variability to a great extent 
(Alkoot, 2019). Six Sigma is made up of five phases of DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) 
that allows solving problems based on data that help make improvements (Siregar & Elvira, 2020). The goal of 
applying this methodology is to achieve continuous improvement that has the ability to evolve, which must assess the 
investment made, the success and goals achieved. (Boangmanalu et al., 2020)

results of higher education in institutes, the results obtained led to a better performance of the graduated students, 
thanks to the diagnosis of the existing problems and then to identify the root causes on which suggested possible 
solutions. Fontalvo et al. agree with these results. (2020), who in their study about the service quality evaluation 
method of a user service unit in a water service company; managed to determine the performance of customer service 
through the variables: number of services attended, opportunity for error, rejected services and process performance; 
at the end of their investigation they determined that the performance of the water service company is generally good; 
however, if he presented a couple of months where his performance was not as expected. Da silva et al. (2019), stated 
that by eliminating variability, it reduces waste and increases productivity. In addition, by offering higher quality 
achieved by applying the Six sigma methodology, organizations seek to achieve greater competitiveness. Likewise, 
according to Navarro et al. (2017), Six Sigma's main objective is to measure to improve quality, based on the collection 
of data and the examination of processes in detail to achieve the closest perfection, having as pillars the time and 
commitment of all the parties involved. For a correct operation of the Six Sigma implementation, according to Suresh 
(2016), products and services must be improved from their design stage, since it is more feasible to try to apply 
improvements in later phases when irreversible failures may occur, the goal it should focus on building better process 
quality through a preventative approach. The context of the Covid-19 pandemic that affected the world since 2020 
cannot be ignored, as mentioned by Ramírez (2021), in his research entitled Lean Six Sigma and Industry 4.0, a review 
from the administration; Given the appearance of the pandemic and the feeling of uncertainty generated, the 
implementation of tools and methodologies are a great alternative so that their performance is not affected and take 
advantage of their opportunities for improvement. 
 
On the other hand, the application of the Six Sigma methodology is not easy to apply, as stated by Galli (2018), 
because it intensively addresses the risks of applying Six Sigma in different organizations, the main ones being: the 
risk of lack of leadership, risk of poor resource management, risk of poor data collection, risk of poor selection of the 
project to study, risk of lack of financial support from the administration and risk of lack of predisposition To the 
change. Organizations and companies need to understand that for the implementation of Six Sigma in their processes 
they must identify the risks in a timely manner in order to manage them properly and thus ensure that the Six Sigma 
tool meets its main objective of reducing failures, reducing costs and increase the quality of the service or product 
being offered. The success of the change cannot depend only on a limited group of people in charge, the commitment 
must be absolute from all the parties involved, from the operators responsible for the operation of the service provided 
or product development to those in charge of the organization, only in this way can implement the required changes 
and that they remain both in the short and long term. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This article has presented the application case of the Six Sigma methodology in an MYPE from Lima-Peru dedicated 
to providing the vehicle washing service that seeks to improve the performance of its process. In the development of 
the investigation, the entire human group that makes up the vehicle washing center was involved, since it is a small 
group of people between operators and those responsible for the administration of the place where the service is 
provided, all were duly instructed. about the steps to be involved and the benefits that will be brought to the company. 
Likewise, the data collection was carried out carefully and with the greatest possible precision to avoid errors in the 
measurement phase, when the improvements were implemented, they were complemented with control measures that 
allowed each person to remember and recognize their role in each stage of the process. process and that the results are 
within the expected limits. 
 
At the end of the Six Sigma implementation process, it was possible to improve the performance of the process by 
increasing the capacity of vehicles washed on average per month from 748 to 845 vehicles, reducing the number of 
hours stopped from 226 to 104; All of this could be demonstrated numerically by means of the process capability 
indicator (Cp) obtained by means of the Minitab tool, reaching a value of 1.33, which demonstrated that the 
performance of the process is optimal. If the commitment of all the parties that belong to an MYPE is achieved, the 
impact of the Six Sigma methodology will translate into improvements that will allow a better development and 
development of the same with the aim of being more competitive and productive.

Abstract 
Thanks to the dynamics of globalization, the worldwide economic environment has seen tremendous changes in recent 
decades. Similarly, Morocco has begun to open its economy, but the results have not performed as expected; the trade 
deficit and Morocco's loss of market share against competitors are perfect examples, because our country's supply is 
primarily concentrated on the European Union. Additionally, traditional markets are experiencing a certain recession, 
whereas emerging markets are dynamic in terms of macroeconomic conditions, which has led Morocco to diversify its 
export destinations. Small and medium-sized businesses are seen as a critical source of development and vitality in all 
countries. Indeed, SMEs have captured the attention of scholars and may now be regarded as a legitimate subject of 
study. The rising internationalization of small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), as their potential to conduct business 
abroad has been regarded. Internationalization has been defined as a cycle as well as the activities that businesses 
engage in to enter foreign markets. Internationalization is ""a more prevalent technique of broadening participation to 
global responsibilities. As a cycle, it is not assured that the internationalization of SMEs follows a regular pattern of 
stages.  On the flipside, it has been seen that varied circumstances provide successions of differentiated chances. In 
this article, which focuses on the literature review of SMEs' internationalization, we began by listing the various 
definitions of the concept of internationalization, and then we listed the various approaches such as the U-model, the 
I-model, Internationalization through economics, Internationalization through networks, finally we highlight
the limitations of each model.

Abstract 
This study focuses on the contribution of environmental commitment to the achievement of business sustainability 
(business, environmental and social performance). Likewise, the author emphasizes the importance of contributing 
environmental commitment to the implementation of circular economy and the competitive advantage of Batik 
MSMEs in Sleman, DIY, Indonesia. Respondents were selected by purposive sampling on creative industry SMEs 
in Sleman, especially batik SMEs who have a commitment to business processes that use natural and not synthetic 
dyes. The statistical technique was processed with Partial Least square 3.0. The results of the study proved that 
MSMEs with an environmental commitment can improve their business sustainability (environmental and social), 
but not on business performance. Likewise, environmental commitment can improve the implementation of circular 
economy and the competitive advantage of batik SMEs in Sleman, DIY.

Abstract 
The objective of the research is to determine the organizational carbon footprint of a company that produces welding 
electrodes, based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol  Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard  (World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute 2004) in order to establish strategies to reduce 
Greenhouse Gases (GHG). The type of research is applied and uses the GHG Protocol methodology.  The study 
considered scopes 1 and 2 established by the methodology. Scope 1 represents the direct emissions produced by the 
consumption of Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LP gas), and the generation of organic waste within the 
company. Scope 2 considered the indirect emissions resulting from the consumption of electrical energy. The results 
showed that the largest amount of CO₂eq was generated within Scope 1 (1,807.34 Ton CO₂eq), followed by the 
emissions considered in Scope 2 (1,694.03 Ton CO₂eq), generating a total carbon footprint of 3,501.38 Ton CO₂eq. 
The proposals to reduce CO₂eq focused on reducing the consumption of natural gas because it is the fuel with the 
highest generation of CO₂eq. In conclusion, this study can be used for companies interested in applying this 
methodology to calculate their organizational carbon footprint. The research gap is that there was no GHG inventory, 
and the ideal would be to have an annual GHG inventory emitting less than 15,000 Tons of CO₂eq.

5.1 Research Limitations 
One of the main limitations found when calculating the carbon footprint for the welding electrode company in Mexico 
was obtaining data on gas consumption in each production line due to the lack of meters installed in each oven and 
specifications for each oven that would help estimate gas consumption. 
 
5.2 Recommendations for Future Research  
Gas meters must be installed in each production line to know the amount of gas consumed by each oven to carry out 
special mitigation measures for each drying oven. Likewise, carry out temperature measurements and energy balances 
in the drying ovens on a monthly basis to estimate the consumption of natural gas in each production line, obtain a 
more detailed carbon footprint, and generate new strategies to reduce GHG emissions without causing impact in plant 
production. New moisture tests must also be generated on all products to obtain new drying cycles that help reduce 
GHG emissions. On the other hand, data must be generated to obtain Scope 3 emissions (travel, supplier energy 
consumption, etc., to generate a more detailed carbon footprint. Monitoring the application of the proposals for the 
reduction of GHG in all production lines and offices will help reduce energy consumption, which will allow companies 
and the entire organization to achieve economic savings and a higher quality status It is important to develop a climate 
change awareness methodology for all company employees company, in order to implement mitigation measures in 
the generation of GHG in their work areas.

Abstract 
Market basket analysis provides an insight into customer consumption patterns and trends in the industry. These will 
be achieved by analyzing and studying the performance of the large datasets of transactions made by consumers held 
in retail stores. These commercial transactions will be analyzed using the Machine Learning technique called the A 
priori algorithm by establishing association rules and determining those groups of items in a market basket whose 
association could represent better economic benefits for companies. This study will analyze the historical sales data 
of the product groups, in order to identify relationships that al-low companies in the sector to generate patterns to 
propose the increase of their portfolio based on the products with the greatest purchasing trends. At the end of this 
investigation, commercial strategies will be proposed to improve sales, take advantage of spaces in stores and 
implement more effective strategic offers, based on the groups of articles with the best associations found.

6. Conclusion
O1: Propose the increase of the portfolio of new national and imported products in the study sector. 
It can be concluded that, although the products with turnover rates and sales flow are the products of first need, 
however, many of these are not characterized by being marketed under a specific brand, but rather under individual 
units.  
O2: Identify strategies that increase sales and generate healthy margins in companies in the retail sector. 
It is highly important to recognize the usefulness of the algorithm to automate the process of identifying potential 
sales, since this allows not only to speed up this process, but also to make commercial decisions for the elaboration of 
new effective strategies.  
O3: Interpret and compare the main statistical indicators of the A priori Algorithms 
It can be concluded that, although it is true that support represents a key indicator in the structuring of all association 
rules, this is not a factor with which just having it is enough to make trading decisions.

Abstract 
In this work, it is necessary to analyze the increase of Back Order in the attention of crossdocking orders in the 
attention of Homecenter customers due to the lack of definition of purchase planning processes, resulting in logistics 
costs, fill rate charges and low service level. Thus, it is intended the companies that handle high volumes of inventory 
and constant orders should have a forecast plan to cover possible stock-outs. The main purpose of the research is to 
explain a way to prevent stock-outs using an artificial intelligence model, based on historical sales data of a medium-
sized company that manages inventories, as well as to determine the machine earning model to predict and reduce 
backorders.  For the data analysis, the Orange software was used, where the data was trained with different artificial 
intelligence models such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and neural networks. The most 
accurate model was defined according to numerical indicators such as the confusion matrix, the area under the curve 
(AUC) and the ROC curve analysis. Thus, we opted for the neural network model, which presented the most accurate 
data. Finally, the results are presented and a suggestion is made at the management level regarding decision making 
in the supply process. For this purpose, itis considered pertinent to delve into the subject of the variables that influence 
the accumulation of backorders.

1. Introduction
With the advent of the internet at the end of the 20th century, the information available to prepare highly effective 
mathematical models was massified (Rudin 2019). Also, the computing power of computers increased benefiting the 
automation of processes in different industrial and technological companies (Rudin 2019). 
In the technology industry, the concept of ""machine learning"" is applied, a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), which 
allows the machine learning without the need to previously program them for it (Adadi y Berrada 2018). Currently, 
this indispensable ability allows systematization to identify patterns among data and predict them (Adadi y Berrada 
2018)

6. Conclusions 
Today's companies seek maximum efficiency in all their processes in order to satisfy the requirements of their 
customers and thus achieve maximum responsiveness. To this end, good inventory management is considered 
important for decision making and to face uncertain futures. One of the main problems that affects the level of, service 
is the accumulation of pending orders due to stock shortages, thus generating additional management costs and 
penalties that in most cases companies are obliged to pay for non-compliance. In the present work, ‘the modeling and 
comparison of performance indicators in the prediction using four classifiers in the Orange software was carried out, 
An analysis and interpretation of the main indicators is then performed to choose the best classification model. 
According to the training of the data by the neural network model, we obtained as results those variables that affect 
the decision making at the time of managing the supply process. 
 
Thus, it is considered important to establish an inventory policy according to the sales to determine the lot to order 
and to propose a safety stock according to the variability of the orders. Then it can be determined that in some SKUs 
that have trends and seasonality in sales, the sales forecast can be calculated with the statistical model of triple additive 
exponential smoothing: in this case it is necessary to clean the data on some dates due to anomalous sales peaks or 
factors that lead to an important alteration in the orders. However, with the application of an artificial intelligence 
model, the data cleaning procedure was optimized because the model learns from previous events and transforms the 
atypical sales.

Abstract 
Big Data (BD) is a vital cog in Industry 4.0 technology that modern organizations adopt to gain competitive advantage. 
Although the factors that lead BD usage are documented in the literature, there is lack of understanding as to how 
these factors are related to one another in predicting and explaining BD usage. This study fills the gap by developing 
and empirically testing a theoretical model, using the Sri Lankan industry as the context. Technical, Organizational 
and Environmental (TOE) Framework is used as the theoretical lens for theory building. The seven constructs of the 
theoretical model were identified by sifting through a large volume of literature to identify the critical success factors 
(CSFs) of BD usage. The relationships between the constructs were also hypothesized from the extant literature. The 
model posited that Top Management Support drives the organization’s Analytics Culture and Information Systems 
Competence to enhance its Analytics Capacity, to cause BD usage. In addition to Analytics Capability (the internal 
factor), the study posits that Competitive Pressure and Government Pressure also act as additional causal antecedents 
of BD usage. A questionnaire was developed to capture different manifestations of the seven constructs and partial 
least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique was used to analyze the data collected. In the main, 
the data supported the hypotheses underpinning the theory. Analytics Capability and Competitive Pressure found to 
have strong and medium effects on BD. The only exception was that the Government Pressure was found to have no 
effect on BD usage (p=0.332). Having demonstrated construct validity of all seven constructs, the study estimated the 
strengths of the theoretical relationships between the constructs; the latter also enabled the researcher to provide 
suggestions to top managers as to how BD usage can be increased in their firms. To the best of our knowledge, this 
study is the first to formulate a theory that explains how different organizational elements work together to improve 
the BD usage. The questionnaire and the practical implications of the empirical findings will be useful to BD 
organizations for continuous improvement.

1. Introduction
The digital transformation is characterised by exchange of a wide variety of data in large amounts between machines 
and users at high speeds. Such data, commonly known as Big Data (BD), is the most pivotal cog in Industry 4.0 
technologies (Lasi et al. 2014; Saturno et al. 2017). In addition to “data and knowledge management”, there are other

by the data, β = 0.062 retuning a p value of 0.332) suggests that none of the above-mentioned forms of government 
pressure has any effect on the Sri Lankan industry.   
 
6. Conclusion  
The three objectives were achieved, and it is argued that the study attempts to make an academic contribution by way 
of formulating and testing a theory to explain the BD usage phenomenon. Previous studies posited several 
enables/determinants of BD usage. They were presented merely as predictors (independent variables) that predict BD 
usage. This study identified the critical predictors (through a sifting process) and organised them in a causal predictive 
manner. This is to create a path model that not only to predicts BD usage, but also explains how BD usage is caused. 
The path model/theory is useful for both the academia and practitioners alike to understand or distinguish successful 
BD implementation from unsuccessful BD implementation.  
 
The validated survey instrument (the questionnaire) means that managers can use this instrument for continuous 
improvement and benchmarking purposes. Managers can conduct self-assessments to take baseline measurements 
(scores) for each CSF (determinant or enabler) of BD usage and keep improving their scores by taking appropriate 
action. This is the first practical contribution of the research. It is acknowledged that improving the scores of some 
CSFs will be more difficult than the others. For example, improving the score of the Analytics Culture could be more 
challenging than improving the score of IS Competence because a technical resource can be acquired more easily 
(e.g., via recruitment) than a soft, intricately bundled, resource (specifically, the culture) which is deep rooted. It is 
suggested that the study be replicated in larger economies to improve the external validity of the findings.

Abstract 
When disposed of improperly, rejected brine, a byproduct of the desalination process used in power plants, can 
negatively affect the environment. However, because it includes compounds that companies require, rejected brine 
may be a useful resource. Sustainable brine management is crucial to ensure environmental and human safety due to 
dynamic and complex requirements for its composition and purification. The valorization strategy changes the 
paradigm of rejected brine from waste into resources for various purposes. This technology can produce a NaCl 
solution from rejected brine to be used as an alternative raw material for the Chlor-alkali industry, especially for 
Indonesia company. This paper aims to compare the cost and benefit of the rejected brine valorization technology 
from membrane-based technology, that is, electrodialysis (ED), reverse osmosis (RO), and osmotically assisted 
reverse osmosis (OARO). There are three schemes to be analyzed, named scheme 1 (UF-ED), scheme 2 (UF-NF-UF-
RO), and scheme 3 (UF-NF-RO-OARO). The result shows that all the schemes gave a negative net beneﬁt in each 
case. The total cost for scheme 2 was lower than another scheme. However, the total benefit for scheme 3 is higher 
than another scheme. Furthermore, it can be seen that scheme 3 has more economical and environmental benefits than 
scheme 1 and scheme 2.

1. Introduction
The rejected brine is a by-product of various industries such as desalination plants, oil and gas, petrochemical, textile, 
and steel industries. It contains salinity of 1.6x – 2x when compared to seawater salinity (Gude, 2018; Panagopoulos 
et al., 2019). The average rejected brine per day is 45-70% of the feed seawater (Ogunbiyi et al., 2021). Brine is 
usually discharged into the environment through ocean/surface water discharge, evaporation ponds, sewage discharge, 
and other options (Arafat, 2017; Viader et al., 2021; Ziolkowska and Reyes, 2017). Regardless of the type of 
desalination plant, disposal of rejected brine from desalination plants into seawater is an important environmental 
concern because effluents contain high salinity, high temperatures, and toxic and non-toxic residual chemicals from 
the pre-treatment process. Consequently, the rejected brine has the potential to cause damage to marine and 
underground habitats, eutrophication, pH fluctuations, and an increase in heavy metals in the marine environment 
(Alameddine and El-Fadel, 2007; Heck et al., 2016, Petersen et al., 2018). At present, several treatment methods have 
been applied. However, these methods are unsustainable today (Panagopoulos, 2022). 
The rejected brine is considered a potential source because it contains valuable compounds, such as Na+ and Cl- 
(Panagopoulos and Giannika, 2022). Sustainable brine management is very important to ensure environmental and 
human safety because brine can be one of the most challenging to treat or dispose of because its composition and 
purification requirements are dynamic and complex (Giwa et al., 2017; Panagopoulos et al., 2019). The valorization 
strategy changes the paradigm of rejected brine, which is a waste into a resource for various other purposes and 
applications (De Buren and Sharbat, 2015). Many process industries require brine as part of their processes, such as

5. Conclusion 
Implementing new technology requires no small amount of money, so decision-makers need to look at other benefits 
derived from the planned implementation of the technology. Analyzing the cost and benefits can systematically 
estimate the feasibility of investing in technology. However, the application of this method in the rejected brine sector, 
especially the valorization of rejected brine, is still limited. based on calculations, the values for net benefits for scheme 
1 is USD -92,47, scheme 2 is USD -87,11, and scheme 3 is USD -87,22. 
 
Each technology has its own advantages and drawbacks regarding water recovery rate and energy consumption. Future 
research should look at combining different membrane technologies to optimize brine concentration with a reasonable 
water recovery rate and operating cost. The recovery of value-added minerals from brine offers both economic and 
environmental benefits. Nevertheless, the processes need to be further optimized to improve the high precision 
separation of single elements from others, and boost the benefit-cost ratio.

Abstract 
National debt has been identified as a major economic problem affecting the developing world in general where vital 
national resources are diverted from developmental functions to meeting debt obligations in interest and principal 
repayments.  A  multiplicity of literature  portraying the causes of the debt build up have tended to bring out petroleum 
imports as one key contributor to third world indebtedness. The study reanalyzes this proposition by studying the 
relative impact of the Zambian petroleum imports on its national debt as a decomposed General Macroeconomic 
Theoretical process utilizing a time-varying two state multivariate Markov-Switching Autoregressive Model (MSAR) 
with Zambian National Debt as the dependent variable and Petroleum imports, Non Petroleum imports, Government 
Expenditures, Gross capital formation, Exports, Private Final Consumption and GDP as the regressors, using annual 
time series data from the early 1980’s to 2019. The study established  national debt reducing effects to have run from 
Petroleum imports, GDP, Gross capital formation and private consumption expenditures in both the dormant and 
expansive states of the model. Debt increasing effects were brought out to have run from Government expenditures 
and national exports in both states of the model. It was only from non-petroleum imports that results were inconclusive.

1. Introduction
National indebtedness for the third world countries is a persistent economic problem. The Zambian case had seen the 
national debt increasing from around US$2.3 Billion in 1980 to around US$19.7 Billion in 2019 (COMSTAT, 2020). 
A number of writers have alluded this problem to petroleum production, imports and oil price shocks. Oils shocks are 
believed to have contributed to a considerable balance of payment deficits among oil importing countries thus creating 
the need for borrowing (Swaray, 2005). Bacon (2005) claimed that the impact of oil price rises was felt through the 
net position of the Balance of Payments and the subsequent contraction required in the economy to restore the 
equilibrium. However petroleum remains a key driver of industry not only in Zambia but world over. The importation 
of petroleum oil dominates all other single commodity import expenditures forming a major part of Zambia’s import 
bill. The petroleum imports rose from around US$197 Million in 1980 to US$2.07 Billion in 2019 (COMSTAT, 
2020). Additionally, however,  other general macroeconomic variables, as determined in the study, equally continued 
to rise in the Zambian case  with Government Expenditures rising from US$514.8 Million to US$2.5 Billion, GDP 
rising from US$4.3 to US$27.2 Billion, Gross Capital Formation rising from US$443.3 Million  to US$ 9.7 Billion, 
Exports rising from US$ 942 Million  to US$10.2 Billion,  Non- Petroleum Imports  rising from US$746.4 Million to

Long run cointegration relationship results using Johansen’s tests for cointegration of the variables at second 
difference are shown in Table 6 where the results revealed the Trace statistic being lower than the 5% critical value at 
maximum rank of 5 implying that the null hypothesis of five (5) cointegrating equations was accepted. This meant 
that there was long run relationship among the independent and dependent variables and corresponded to the maximum 
n -1 regressor/cointegrating equations requirement  (With n being the number of regressors). As such the results from 
the study portrayed a valid long run cointegrated relationship among the variables.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The relationship between petroleum import expenditures and national is brought out by the study as running contrary 
to most of the reviewed studies and where the long run relationship is of an inverse nature where increased petroleum 
import expenditures had debt reducing effects. This meets the general objective and the specific objective of evaluating 
the extent to which crude petroleum imports impacted Zambian national debt as the study showed that petroleum 
imports did have an impact on the Zambian national debt and the impact was debt reducing.  
 
The model brings out GDP increases to be an equally long run national debt reducing factor though with relatively 
lower magnitudes than the petroleum impact but consistent in both the dormant and expansive states of the model. 
This equally met the objective of evaluating the effect of gross domestic product on the Zambian national debt. 
The objective of investigating the impact of private domestic consumption on the Zambian national debt was met by 
the study equally bringing out a debt reducing impact from the Final private consumption in both states of the model.  
 
Gross capital formation was another general macroeconomic variable that had a long run national debt reducing impact 
on national debt. This met the specific objective of investigating the impact of gross capital formation on the Zambian 
national debt where the result was consistent debt reducing impact in both states of the model. Economically we may 
attribute this contribution to the reduction in national debt through the gross fixed capital formation positive boost to 
the economic growth channel.  
 
The objective of evaluating the effect of government expenditure on the Zambian national debt was achieved by the 
study establishing that government consumption had consistent national debt increasing effects in the long run whose 
economic reason is largely that the government has been financing its expenditures through borrowed resources in the 
long run which has translated into this consistent and significant contribution of government expenditures to national 
debt.   
 
Quite in contrast to the general macroeconomic theory expectation, the objective of determining the impact that 
exports had on the Zambian national debt was equally achieved by the study revealing that there had existed long run 
national debt increasing effects from national exports in the Zambian case. Ideally exports are supposed to be 
contributing to the current account surplus if not reducing the deficits. In the Zambian case this has not been the long 
run case. Finally the study brought out a non-consistent and as such inconclusive results on the effects of non-
petroleum imports on the state of Zambian national debt which made the objective of evaluating  the extent to which 
non - petroleum imports impacted the Zambian national debt in the period of the study a an inconclusive result open 
to further analysis.

Abstract 
The investigation was carried out in the workshop area of the company GIANT IBARRA, whose main problem is the 
delay in the delivery of finished bicycles causing a breach of the demand requested by the commercial area. This 
reason influences the proposal of an improvement within the production process, which allows a decrease in 
productive time, guarantees efficiency, and reduces the use of resources that do not add value to the process through 
the application of tools of the Lean Manufacturing methodology. The development of the proposal required the design 
and description of operational tools such as 5'S, Kanban, and Manufacturing Cell; for the latter, the new working 
method that will increase efficiency was determined. Through the Value Chain Map (VSM) tool, it was possible to 
obtain the results of improvement based on certain indicators, where a decrease in lead time of 27.55 minutes is 
observed; on the other hand, the production capacity is increased to 27 bicycles generating an efficiency increase of 
8.05%.

1. Introduction
Lean Manufacturing begins with James Watt, who invented the double-acting steam engine in 1776, opening the 
Industrial Revolution. Later, Frederick Taylor changed the focus of manufacturing in the twentieth century and 
proposed the division of areas to concentrate on more specific activities which became the standardization of work 
(Socconini, 2019). For his part, Henry Ford finished manufacturing his first car called the Model T in 1896, of which 
15 million units were manufactured; in 1913 Ford created its assembly line and thus revolutionized manufacturing. 
Sakichi Toyoda who is part of the creation of Lean Manufacturing, learned as a child the trade of carpenter that he 
would later apply in a great invention, which consisted of a device that made the loom stop is a thread broke, warning 
with a visual signal to the operator that the machine needs attention, the invention was called Jidhoka in 1890. 
1.1 Objective 
Optimize production, through Lean Manufacturing tools, which allows for improving the level of service provided 
2. Literature Review
(Lorente, 2018), (Buer, Strandhagen, & Chan, 2018), (Maria Pia Ciano, 2021) (F.T.SChan, 2001), (Economics, 2008) 
(Aydin Torkabadi, 2018), (Leong, et al., 2019), and, (John, Sampayo, & Peças, 2021) companies continuously strive 
to increase the productivity and production of their operations. Lean has been created and defined as Toyota's waste 
disposal process along with supporting a system to reduce or eliminate waste and non-value-added activities from 
various processes. (Abualfaraa, Salonitis, Al-Ashaab, & Ala'raj, 2020), (Kurilova-Palisaitiene, Sundin, & Poksinska, 
2018) (Ballé, Chartier, Coignet, & Olivencia, 2019), they propose that the value stream are all the steps, both value-
added and non-value added required to bring a product or service of the raw material to the customer. (Xiao-Yong

implementing a cleaning and disinfection system through a planning that records the work of each designated 
worker. All this in order to standardize certain activities and track the application of Checklist of the 5S. 
2.
KANBAN: The design of Kanban cards seeks to reduce delays or permanently eliminate the existing
bottleneck. Another contribution is to plan how much should be produced and how much is needed for each
thread.
3.
Manufacturing Cell: This method was necessary to properly distribute the work areas, being thus that the
main warehouse and the workshop were unified due to the space and the physical and environmental
conditions.
4.
Working method: Developing a new method by locating the activities and production times can be achieved
to have better results and an increase in productivity.
After performing the analysis of each key indicator for the performance of the company and applying the 
aforementioned tools, the improvements are obtained and observes that there is a decrease in time that does not add 
value, which influences productivity to rise as well as productive capacity, thus fulfilling the main objective that is 
the improvement in the performance of the process. 
4. Conclusion
1.
Based on the documentary research of the company, fieldwork, and application of the VSM tool in it, it has
been found that the workshop has shortcomings that start from its planning, where the existence of over
processes and waits within the assembly of rings was found which directly influences the general assembly
time.
2.
The Kaizen Events allowed to determine the strengths and opportunities that the company has, so by
establishing strategies that improve its performance, it was possible to increase the efficiency of the company
from 84.43% to 92.48%.
3.
The 5s were of utmost importance to generate a habit of order and cleanliness which influenced that there is
a better organization and therefore there is a decrease in time that does not add value in a total of 3.94 minutes
thus seeing an increase in the evaluation of the 5s starting from the current situation with 46% to the data
obtained through the proposal of 84%.
4.
By applying the design of the new working method and the manufacturing cells, it is possible to reduce the
cycle time from 158.58 minutes to 131.03 minutes, in the same way the distance or travel during the flow of
the process was shortened since the warehouse 1 and the workshop were unified, thus being a route of 10.14
meters with respect to the current situation which denoted a total of 17.8 meters; this through the support of
the 5s to locate the materials and resources that evidenced an improvement in their productive capacity to 27
bicycles per month increasing their productivity to 0.45 bicycles/hours.
5.
The establishment of a working method through the pre-assemblies contributed to the increase of the
fulfillment of the orders eliminating the existing waste being the most important the delays in the processes,
that is how, the bottleneck originated in the subprocess of assembly of rings was eliminated giving way to a
continuous productive flow.

Abstract 
In the Philippines, the daily commute of Filipinos has always been a challenge, even before the pandemic. The Covid-
19 pandemic has substantially impacted the public transportation sector and made commuting even more challenging. 
The Quezon City Bus Service or QCity Bus Service is one of the initiatives developed by the Quezon City government 
to alleviate the challenges brought about by the pandemic by providing free bus rides. The study aims to identify 
factors that influence passengers’ satisfaction and determine how physical and perceived attributes impact passenger 
satisfaction to present relevant findings and recommendations that can help construct a more effective and strategic 
administration of free public transportation services. The physical attributes considered in this study were reliability, 
frequency, speed, accessibility, information provision, ease of transfers/interchanges, and vehicle condition. On the 
other hand, comfort, safety, convenience, and aesthetics were the perceived attributes used in this study. A total of 
one hundred fifty (150) respondents were taken from commuters who avail of the QCity Bus Service. The 
questionnaire was categorized into two parts: socio-demographic information and satisfaction rating. The researchers 
used a 5-point Likert scale to evaluate and quantify the passengers’ satisfaction with the physical and perceived 
attributes and overall satisfaction with the QCity Bus Service. Correlation and multiple regression analysis will be 
used to analyze data. The research aims to test the claim that physical attributes have a significant relationship with 
passenger satisfaction and that perceived attributes have a significant relationship with passenger satisfaction at α = 
0.05 level of significance.

1. Introduction
The worldwide pandemic caused by the widespread transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 virus (World Health 
Organization, 2020) magnified major issues in the country, particularly concerning public transportation. With the 
rapid surge of coronavirus cases in the country, the entire Luzon was placed under an enhanced community quarantine 
(Geducos and Kabiling, 2020). In the first quarter of 2020, only personal cars and authorized business vehicles for 
employees were permitted to travel following the strict restrictions on the transportation system enacted in the country. 
Eventually, when the number of positive cases was decreased and regulated, the lockdown gradually eased, which 
lifted travel and mobility restrictions, allowing the resumption of economic activities and limited operation of public 
transportation (Geducos and Jazul, 2020). According to Jiang et al. (2022), urban mobility in Metro Manila decreased 
dramatically in response to COVID-19 lockdowns, by up to 85%. Moreover, even months after the strictest restrictions 
were lifted, national mobility remained almost 30% lower than it had been before the lockdown. The daily commute 
of Filipinos, particularly those in Metro Manila, which has always been challenging, became even more difficult 
compared to before the outbreak. Thus, the local government units launched several initiatives for people to cope with 
the impact of the pandemic.

of transportation that is offering free services to the public commuters. Furthermore, if possible, future researchers 
should try to physically survey or interview passengers, as there is also a limitation of responses when being surveyed 
via online means. The authors suggest involving persons with disabilities (PWD), senior citizens, etc., in future studies. 
Lastly, this study used a five Likert scale rate as part of their survey questionnaire wherein there is a neutral option 
that makes the responses relatively imprecise due to having a neutral decision to choose from. The authors suggest 
utilizing an even-numbered Likert scale rate in order to acquire more definite responses.  
 
6. Conclusion  
To determine the relationship between quality attributes and satisfaction and identify the significant variables that 
affect passengers' satisfaction with the Quezon City free bus service, is the goal of this study. The researchers were 
able to successfully gather data from respondents by conducting an online survey. Different statistical methods were 
used to evaluate the relationship between variables. To summarize, the results show that: 
 
1. The majority of the respondents are men, and their ages typically range from 10 to 25. The majority of 
respondents work, and most of them live in Quezon City. The majority of riders utilize the QCity Bus 1-2 
times a week, and Route 1 is the most frequently traveled route.  
2. The researchers found that reliability, frequency, accessibility, and ease of transfer are Physical Attributes 
that greatly influence passengers’ satisfaction with Quezon City’s free bus service. 
3. Comfort, convenience, and aesthetics are Perceived Attributes that greatly influence passengers’ satisfaction 
with Quezon City’s free bus service. 
4. 𝐻𝐻01 is rejected and 𝐻𝐻𝑎𝑎1 is accepted, thus concluding that there is a significant relationship between physical 
attributes and the passengers’ satisfaction with Quezon City’s free bus service. 
5. 𝐻𝐻02 is rejected and 𝐻𝐻𝑎𝑎2 is accepted, thus concluding that there is a significant relationship between perceived 
attributes and the passengers’ satisfaction with Quezon City’s free bus service. 
6. Based on the findings above, the researchers created the PLS-SEM figure that also serves as the passenger 
satisfaction model. There is a statistically significant relationship between both perceived and physical 
attributes and the passengers' satisfaction with Quezon City's free bus service, as shown by the PLS-SEM 
model, that every numerical value in the inner and outer models exceeds the required standard value. 
 
This study aims to provide comprehensive data about the correlation between Quezon City Bus Service attributes and 
customer satisfaction that can influence how strategically public transportation systems are implemented and how well 
passengers' requirements and wants are achieved. The study could potentially benefit both passengers and the 
local/national government since it evaluates and determines the factors that affect passenger satisfaction in Quezon 
City, thus providing a new perception of the free Bus Service administered by the Quezon City Government. Given 
the significance of transportation in our everyday lives, improving system efficiency in the Philippines remains an 
extreme challenge. The results may be utilized by the national and/or local government units (LGUs), Metropolitan 
Manila Development Authority (MMDA), non-governmental organizations (NGO), etc. who seek to provide their 
fellow countrymen with efficient and convenient public transportation. Implementers of free public transportation 
services may consider factors such as reliability, frequency, accessibility, ease of transfer, comfort, convenience, and 
aesthetics to fulfill and satisfy passengers’ physical and perceived demands and deliver a higher overall satisfaction 
with their service.

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a logistics service company located in Batam. The problems that occur at this time are the problem of 
overcrowding in the warehouse and wrong sorting. This study aims to identify how the proposed efficiency 
improvement in the distribution system of goods using the cross docking method. The method that will be used in this 
research is the cross docking method. Cross docking is eliminating the storage process in the warehouse, so it can save 
time and money. The cross docking distribution system does not have continuous storage of goods, because its 
function is only a transit point for a shipment of goods. Goods are not stored for a long time, so the flow of goods is 
received until they are sent back, which is about 2-3 hours, or a maximum of 12 hours, in the warehouse, there are no 
available shelves or zero inventory. Based on the research, the data processing and discussion results are very 
profitable, namely efficiency for zero inventory. Shows that if the company adds 1 sorting table to 6 sorting tables 
with a result of 90,000kg, once loading and unloading aircraft is ±77,000kg, this can be shown to be 
90,000kg>77,000kg efficiency is generated because the output of the sorting table is greater than the incoming input 
so that there are no goods stored in the warehouse and increase the number of trucks by 10 units, then the delivery of 
goods can be done one way and no goods are stored in the warehouse. The results of the analysis can be said that the 
application of cross docking in the company gains efficiency in the distribution of goods to expedition partners.

1. Introduction
In today's global era, various companies are competing to improve efficiency to gain profit, one of which is by paying 
attention to the problem of the logistics distribution system. According to Li, logistics is the management of the flow 
of goods from a point of origin ending at the point of consumption to meet certain demands, for example, directed to 
consumers or companies (Li, 2014). The types of goods in the logistics sector consist of physical tangible objects such 
as food, building materials, animals, equipment, and fluids. Similarly, the movement of intangible objects (abstract) 
such as time, information, particles, and energy. Physical goods logistics generally involve the integration of 
information flow, material handling, production, packaging, inventory, transportation, warehousing, and security. 
Complexity in logistics can be analyzed, described into a model, visualized, and optimized with existing simulation 
software.  
One of the logistics service companies, precisely in Batam, is a freight forwarding company that manages loading and 
unloading, cargo container transportation services, air warehousing services, temporary storage places, and property 
rental services, both closed and open warehouses, as well as public refueling station services. PT. XYZ has a problem 
regarding distribution efficiency performance. Based on the identification of data from the customer, there are several 
problems faced, namely the problem of full load in the warehouse, rescheduling aircraft, and wrong sorting of goods. 
2. Method
This research was conducted at a logistics company based on Batam City. The period from this research is January 
2022 to June 2022.  In this primary data, the data collected is the result of interviews. The technique of collecting data 
by interview is to get information by asking directly employees who work at PT XYZ. Secondary data is supporting

The difference in the details of the data from the previous one is that data that has been designed using a cross docking 
system is more efficient due to the loss of 46,4% time in storing goods that will be stored on shelves to make the 
system work faster in sending goods to customers directly. 
4. Conclusion
Based on the results of the design of the distribution center warehouse in the research that has been carried out using 
the cross docking method, the conclusions are:  
1.
Before designing the distribution center cross docking system, the thing that needs to be done is to identify the
old warehouse first and then make a detailed schematic sequentially regarding the tasks and arrangement of the
workflow of the distribution of goods.
2.
In designing new dc requirements, there are several stages to clarify the process, namely identification of dc
needs to be based on interviews with related parties.
3.
The design of the cross docking system that has been made can eliminate 12% of the time so that it can save time
in carrying out goods distribution work operations.

Abstract 
The United Nations (UN) defines community development as “a process designed to create conditions of 
economic and social progress for the whole community with its active participation and the fullest possible 
reliance on the community’s initiative”. Within the context of a community engagement project, the 
technological solution and systems installed in the community to solve the problem, cannot be viewed in 
isolation. The community engagement project must be viewed from a socio-technical perspective, where the 
design, development and implementation of the solution must consider the impact on the community and their 
interaction with the solution.  The implementation of technological solutions to community needs must therefore 
consider both the societal and technological inter-relationships; as well as creating an awareness of the 
sustainability and impact of the engineering activity on the social, industrial, and physical environment.  This 
paper considers rural community engagement as a socio-technical construct and discusses the value and 
contribution of technological intervention within the social and economic system of a rural community towards 
self-sustenance. 
Keywords 
Socio-technical systems, community engagement 
1. Introduction
In South Africa, community engagement is one of the three pillar responsibilities of higher education, alongside 
research and teaching (South African Council on Higher Education, 2010). The spirit of transformation of South 
Africa’s Higher Education promotes tertiary institutions to develop social responsibility and awareness amongst 
students to engage in community service programmes for social and economic development (Department of 
Education, 2022). In this context, community engagement projects undertaken by universities can be mutually 
rewarding: technology introduced to communities can contribute to the sustainable development and upliftment 
of the local community; whereas academics and students are exposed to real-world problems and expected to 
solve these problems in the community for the benefit of its members (Nel, 2018).  In a case study of 
accelerating access to electricity services in a Kenyan village, the authors, Uhsrud et al. 2015, state that a ""socio-
technical systems perspective emphasizes that technology and society develop in mutual interaction – they co-
evolve, creating socio-technical change, not only technological change"".  The aim of community engagement 
would be for the village to achieve economic self-sustenance (Uhsrud et al. 2015). 
However, tertiary institutions face several challenges associated with the dynamics and complexity of 
community engagement. These may include access to finance to fund the project; ineffective communication 
amongst the stakeholders of the projects; lack of community buy-in and community participation leading to 
distrust; geographical distance and inaccessibility; potential negative environmental impact; lack of support and 
insufficient training; and lack of maintenance after the project has completed (Nel 2018; Uhsrud et al. 2015; 
Uhsrud et al. 2011).

voiced.  An interesting and constant challenge faced by the project team includes the fit-for-purpose assessment 
of equipment obtained from corporate industrial sponsors. In many cases, the sponsored equipment is not ideally 
suited for a rural environment; and creative thinking is required from the project team to solve these unique 
challenges as they consider the needs of the community as well as the corporate sponsor who funded the project.  
 
The other aspects such as accessibility and affordability, and maintenance and repair, require significant 
consideration.  Maintenance and repair are still addressed by a project team member having to drive to the 
village and conduct the necessary work, which demands two to three days’ time from the team member. This 
remains an uneconomical and unviable solution and the project team is currently investigating alternate 
equipment with longer lifespans through cost-benefit analysis and consideration of accessibility and 
affordability. 
 
4.2 Financial Considerations 
Funding of the equipment, labour and installed maintenance for the project was sourced from a corporate 
sponsor.   Several authors state that funding and the management thereof are two of the key barriers to success 
in community engagement projects (Uhsrud et al. 2015; Uhsrud et al. 2011; Ahlborg and Sjöstedt 2015; Schöttl 
and Lindemann 2015; Clegg 2000).  The project team manages the corporate sponsor / university relationship, 
as well as the effective and appropriate distribution of the funds.  The team must ensure that the funds are 
disbursed across the full project lifecycle, from inception to support and maintenance; always being cognizant of 
the requirements of all the stakeholders of the project as well as the dynamic changes in the system. 
Furthermore, the fiduciary responsibility of the fund allocation rests with the project team leader and ultimately 
the University; and the fund accounts are professionally audited as per University regulations.  Sourcing and 
management of funds from industry or research grants require skill and experience; and a key success factor of 
community engagement projects is the appointment of people with the requisite skill to the project team. 
 
4.3 Social Considerations 
The project enabled the project team and researchers to delineate the social construct of the socio-technical 
system.  Elements that characterized the social aspect of the project were cultural differences, language barriers, 
lack of communication channels, and geographical separation - all elements with the potential to contribute to a 
misunderstanding of the needs of the community and consequent disengagement from the project by them.  
 
The project team is from an urban university, and they needed to determine how they could effectively engage 
with the rural community to design solutions for the identified problems. As outsiders, it is often difficult to 
identify the priorities of the locals and to understand the best way in which it can be met, especially when faced 
with language and cultural barriers (Montgomery 2009). To address the language barrier, all communication 
took place via interpreters who could understand both the native language (Venda) and English. Cultural 
communication methods were introduced to the project team from team members who were familiar with the 
cultural communication methods employed in the community. 
 
One of the main requirements for effective and sustainable community engagement projects relies on social buy-
in (Uhsrud et al. 2011; Ahlborg and Sjöstedt 2015; Goldfields 2015; Alvial-Palavicino et al. 2011). Simply 
providing the community with equipment or technology without engaging with the community on their needs 
and the maintenance of the equipment, will leave the community in a worse state than before the intervention. It 
is imperative to include the community in all aspects of planning, decision making and implementation of the 
proposed solutions. The project team’s view of an appropriate technology solution might not be the best for the 
community.  As a result, a thorough needs assessment was conducted to ensure that the correct technology or 
solution was provided for the community (Naidoo and Meyer 2017). 
 
4.4 Environmental Considerations 
Appropriate resource management was a critical consideration by the project team to ensure that the resources 
consumed in the community do not have a long-term negative impact. One of the main foci in the village 
revolved around water provision. South Africa is a water scarce country, ranked the world’s 30th driest country 
where water conservation and the efficient use of water are key national priorities (World Cup Legacy Report 
2011). The technology solution, including water pipes, taps and irrigation systems, was designed and 
implemented with the dual purpose to provide water to the impoverished community and to conserve it. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The Gwakwani Project offered the University of Johannesburg the opportunity to engage in rural community 
development as a socio-technical system.  The project promoted and developed critical and innovative thinking 
in the project team regarding the impact of their engineering activity. Through participation in real-world

projects and providing technical solutions which directly impact the people and the environment, the project 
team gained an ""integrated perspective on society and technology, energy and development, and social 
transformation"" (Uhsrud et al. 2011). 
As previously discussed, key characteristics of a socio-technical system are that the system is mutable, flexible, 
and adaptive to change.  The Gwakwani Project demonstrated these qualities in the dynamic interface between 
the social and technological factors, as well as the relationships amongst the University, project team, funders, 
and the community.  The constant need for social, political, technical, and financial adjustments; as well as the 
new requirements expressed by the community, demands a continual learning process by the many actors and 
stakeholders in the system.  These qualities of rural community engagement as a socio-technical design are 
confirmed by Uhsrud et al. (2015) in the following extract:  
Another key result is that the socio-technical design should have sufficient flexibility, allowing for changes and 
improvements because demands and practices of use are often difficult to foresee and are shaped only during the 
use phase of a technology.  Flexibility is also important in order to facilitate creativity and innovation by local 
actors.  Organizations that fund or initiate such projects should be prepared for changes in the project even after 
implementation.  
Working in a deeply rural community where resources are limited, the project team became aware of the social, 
environmental, and economic responsibility of using available resources appropriately. The intention of 
engagement with rural communities towards self-sustenance, however, is difficult to achieve.  The remote 
geographical location of the village, the level of education of villagers, and the lack of constant and reliable 
electricity supply are factors that contribute to their reliance on external funding and government support. 
Ahlborg and Sjöstedt (2015) found similar challenges in providing small-scale hydropower in Tanzania:  ""The 
main lesson learned from this study, however, is that many of these challenges can be overcome:  having a long 
time frame, acknowledging the challenges, and having the resources to restructure the program accordingly"". 
The value and contribution of the work presented in this paper lie in the application of the principles of socio-
technical theory to a relatively new and unexplored system, namely rural community engagement.  In a country 
as diverse and unique as South Africa, culture and language play a major role in effective communication 
between urban and rural actors; which may determine the success of the project in its entirety.  
The intervention in the Gwakwani Village was initiated as a small-scale University project, but continues to 
grow in its’ impact and learning as new requirements are expressed by the village members.  Uhsrud et al. 
(2011) predict that ""Such small experiments constitute important pioneering activities in order to create new 
socio-technical systems that sometime may achieve a significant role in society"".  This is certainly a reflection 
of the Gwakwani Project, where companies and government agencies are starting to show interest in funding 
and promoting similar projects across the country, realizing perhaps the most fundamental aim of rural 
community engagement – to alleviate our fellow countrymen and women of deep poverty.

Abstract 
The pangasius agroindustry has significant potential to boost added value, build economic processes, raise the 
commercial community, offer jobs, generate economic opportunities, and strengthen the national economy. The base 
value of the pangasius agroindustry is due to the need for more innovative product development, which is essential to 
sustainable agroindustry. Making the appropriate option when selecting a new product development concept is crucial to 
generating a successful new product. The selection of concepts is crucial for mitigating risk in a variety of market and 
uncertainty settings. AHP is appropriate for dealing with decision-making challenges involving multiple connected 
aspects. Combining AHP with fuzzy set theory has created a recent offshoot known as fuzzy AHP. This innovative 
method widens the decision-making application scope much further. Despite the widespread use of fuzzy AHP, only 
some studies have compared the priority weight vectors generated by fuzzy AHP with those of classical AHP. This 
research compares the two AHP techniques by examining the weight vectors derived from real-world case studies. Four 
distinct fuzzy AHP techniques were derived from past research and tested using a variety of fuzzy fundamental scales 
and weight aggregation to determine which produces the most equivalent outcomes to standard AHP. The principal 
findings and outcomes from the four methodologies are presented and thoroughly explored.

1. Introduction
The creation of innovative goods in the fish agroindustry is called downstream fish agroindustry. Downstream fish 
agroindustry, in this case, pangasius sp agroindustry, has the potential to flourish because pangasius sp commodities 
play a significant role in the national economy, and fish farmers control the fishery sector; therefore, pangasius sp 
commodities are commodities that can benefit farmers' (Kaminski et al., 2018). Downstream in the agroindustry can 
boost Product value-added, reinforce the industrial structure, create jobs, and create commercial prospects (Joffre et al., 
2017). Agroindustry downstream can be developed by boosting product development. New product development and 
innovation are frequently cited as the keys to a company's success (Bstieler, 2012; McKenzie et al., 2022). Today's 
market wants high-quality, high-performance, low-cost items (Yusuf and Suyanto, 2019).

Table 15. Fuzzy and Classical AHP comparison 
 
Consideration point 
Remarks 
Uncertainty 
  
When ambiguity in identifying the scale number is minimal, AHP fuzzy scales may be 
preferable to regular AHPH scales. Flexible scales, such as those that are not impacted by 
AHP fuzziness or have a range of potential values, must be considered when using AHP 
fuzzy. 
Ease of use 
 
 
 
Fuzzy numbers are represented by several numbers, such as three for fuzzy triangular 
numbers and four for trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Classical AHP is easier because it only 
works simultaneously with one number. Readers unfamiliar with fuzzy number operations, 
such as multiplication or reciprocity, may make a mathematical error. 
Design of 
hierarchy 
 
 
 
The number of elements must be considered while creating a decision hierarchy. Too many 
criteria in the same category cause decision-makers to make inconsistent decisions. The 
comparison of two fuzzy numbers, in particular, is a time-consuming procedure. Ten 
elements need 90 comparisons, whereas 15 factors need 210 comparisons. 
Pairwise 
comparisons 
 
To decrease evaluation error in AHP fuzzy, employing linguistic phrases is highly significant 
and is preferable to fuzzy numbers (e.g., 3, 5, 7). Numbers or linguistic concepts might be 
utilized in comparison to classical AHP. Both AHP approaches need expert pairwise 
comparisons of components. 
 
Applicability 
Classical AHP and fuzzy AHP may be utilized efficiently in various decision-making 
circumstances, such as determining an individual's fitness for a specific position or task. The 
computed weight vectors may change depending on the core fuzzy scale design and 
aggregation mechanism. 
 
When there is a relatively modest variance between several parameters, say more than five, the fuzzy AHP approach 
may be prone to rank reversal. In this situation, the final PVA weight vector cannot be greater than the PA weight 
vector. Overall, rank reversals were discovered in the three matrices for M2 and M3 and the two for M4 and M5. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendation 
Classical and fuzzy AHP has been actively used for various objectives, including assessing technology and equipment. 
Four distinct techniques were studied by altering the basic fuzzy scales and weight aggregations. Fuzzy AHP 
approaches were evaluated to determine which delivers the most equivalent outcomes to standard AHP. 
The following are the primary conclusions from this extensive study: 
1. The priority weights were generated on a given decision hierarchy using four alternative fuzzy AHP 
techniques. The results showed that the weights might change greatly depending on the design of the fuzzy 
membership functions. The mistake rate rose when more elements were included in an assessment matrix. 
2. The rank reversal was detected in all fuzzy AHP techniques examined and was most prevalent in the 
Pangasius Fillet and Surimi Based Product categories. Small discrepancies in ranking factors are 
unavoidable, owing to how they handle pairwise comparison matrices. 
3. It is important to consider the fuzzy basic scale to employ with whatever weight aggregation. 
4. Overall, M5 performed the best compared to a classical AHP method, while M3 performed the worst. 
 
The recommendation is that the fuzzy AHP technique necessitates extra calculations, owing to comparing two fuzzy 
integers' degrees of possibility (V values). More comparisons are made with more elements, and this growth is 
exponential. Six comparisons are needed for a matrix with three components, whereas thirty are needed for a matrix 
with six factors.

Abstract 
The strive to sustain excellence within organizations has increased with the constant change in customer demands 
and toughening of competition. With these rapid changes occurring, the need for organizations to be agile has 
become a significant element in their operation schemes to sustain the excellence and be future-ready. This need 
raises the question of the relationship between organizational excellence and agility. Various models and 
frameworks have been developed to achieve excellence and agility in organizations. However, limited studies 
have correlated the two. This research investigates the relationship between excellence and agility within 
organizations and develops an assessment correlation index matrix between the two domains. That will help 
organizations understand their states in agility and excellence. The out-take for an organization is to know its 
categorization in the correlation model (beginner, master, conservative or fashionist) and determine the under-
achieving pillars in each domain. The results of the study have shown that there is a high positive correlation 
between the two domains in both the public and private organizations. Although while one would expect that 
private organizations would have higher correlation between the two domains, it has been observed in this study 
that public organizations within the UAE have shown higher correlation data.  This could be attributed to the 
fact that the Government of the UAE has introduced various initiatives since the 90’s that encouraged public 
organizations to implement excellence models such as DQA and SKEA. Moreover, the study has shown that 
regardless of the size of the company, the correlation between agility and excellence is highly positive.

Introduction
With constant changes in customers’ demands and increase in competition, organizations have become more 
aware of the importance of being agile in their operation schemes. Agility is defined as the organizations ability 
in merging their response-ability and knowledge management to respond swiftly, effectively, and properly to any 
unanticipated change (Wendler 2014). To reach the ability of flexibility in their response, organizations must 
attain the best ability they can in six main domains within the organization, namely: futuristic vision, innovation, 
flexibility, co-operation, and speed (Al-Hammouri 2020). There are various tools that can help organizations in 
achieving these domains. Such as their technologies, team structure, management of the organization and process 
structure (Avazpour, Ebrahimi and Fathi 2014). To achieve agility within the organization, it is key that the 
performance and quality of service the organization remains high. This is due to the important of achieving the 
best they could which makes adapting to new changes more efficient and less time consuming, since they know 
how the organization operates and performs the way it does. 
Excellence is an important concept that determines the level of quality the organization maintains throughout the 
entire process of its operation. To achieve the best performance and results, the organization should focus on three 
main elements within the process that would guarantee their success and marks them as excellent. Firstly, 
organizations should set a clear direction by utilizing well defined goals and clear visions to be attained. Executing 
the organization’s vision should be initiated by utilizing a well-defined and clear strategy that involves all 
stakeholders in its implementation. Secondly, for the organization to determine how well they are proceeding, 
continuous performance analysis should be done. Based on the vision that the organization has established, the

domains. 
 
 In average, the correlation model has shown that small organizations are concentrated in one region, indicating 
that there is less variation in this group. Because these organizations have smaller teams, change may be executed 
more rapidly because less resources are required. 
 
It was seen that organizations that have high excellence capabilities also had high agile capabilities. From the data, 
it has been concluded that a few of the organizations had relatively higher agile capabilities with low excellence 
ranking, as only two organizations were found in the fashionist category. Even the correlation between agility and 
excellence for these two companies are high, indicating their understating that focusing on agility is important to 
achieve excellence. However, they need to achieve the pillars of the two domains better to move into the master 
classification. This confirms the conclusion made from previous researchers that agility is a driver and enabler of 
excellence (Al-Hammouri 2020). Since the organization is quick in overcoming unexpected changes without 
affecting its performance, it has become excellent at what it does. One would expect those who focus on agility 
without being excellent either they modified their business to stay competitive or have gone out of business. With 
the fashionist category having only two organizations, it shows that organizations have seen the true importance 
of excellence within the organization, especially with the latest challenge the whole world faced (COVID 19) and 
had to change the entire operation processes to be able to survive in the new way of work.  
 
A minor number of organizations have been reported in the beginner category, which indicates that some 
organizations are yet to work on their capabilities in both domains. Such organizations may need to focus on their 
value adding pillar. The average of the organizations in the category have achieved a low score in their service 
and product delivery utilizing innovative and proactive methodologies. Moreover, they should focus on investing 
in the human talents and creative capabilities within their organization to be able to improve their excellence.  
 
Within the categories, most of the organizations fall under the master category. This shows that as organizations 
grow and operate, they have gained a great learning curve from their journeys. This is due to the constant changes 
and challenges that is faced by the organizations. The more challenges they face, the better the organizations 
become at budling their agile capabilities.  
 
The results have shown only one organization falls under the conservative classification, very close to the 
intersection of all classes. Like the conclusions made on the Fashionist class, organizations understand the 
importance of the correlation of the two domains. However, this company needs to focus on improving their 
capabilities in being agile, as well as excellence. Not having companies in the extreme of the conservative class 
shows many companies already have realized the importance of agility and implemented it in their operation to a 
good degree.  
 
The analyses conducted in this research could be expanded for further conclusions to be made and confirmed.  
The study can be conducted using a larger sample which would lead to a wider participation range. The sample 
size in this study was of a moderate size that allowed for basic conclusions. With a wider sample size, the 
categorization of the organizations can be detailed to describe the key capabilities of the organizations in each 
category. Using the detailed characteristics, further research can be done to guide organizations in moving from 
the category they are currently in to become in the master category.  
6. 
Conclusion 
In this study, the correlation between organizational agility and excellence has been analyzed. Utilizing a detailed 
questionnaire, the performance of organizations in the UAE was gauged in both domains. The aim was to build a 
model that would categories organizations based on their capabilities in agility and excellence. With a sample size 
of 53 organizations, it was found that there is high positive correlation between agility and excellence. This finding 
confirms the conclusion found in the previous studies about the link between the two domains. Moreover, it was 
found that the organization size is not a factor that influences the correlation between the two domains. It is 
possible that this conclusion may differ with a wider sample size. Furthermore, it was identified that the public 
organizations within the UAE had shown a relatively higher correlation between agility and excellence. This could 
be due to the initiatives taken by the UAE government in increasing excellent capabilities within public 
organizations. The model used in this study is to be further developed by taking a larger sample size to gain better 
categorization of organizations. Moreover, mapping the domains of excellence to those of agility in details so that 
recommendations for organizations to move from the lower categories into the master category of agility and 
excellence is to be developed.

Abstract 
Financial sustainability is the ability of public administrations to continue now and in the future current policies 
without causing the debt to rise continuously. Both Local and international NGOs in Lusaka have had challenges 
on financial sustainability. However, there is little evidence on key risk factors affecting sustainability of local 
NGOs in Lusaka. This study thus, sought to examine the risk factors that affect the financial sustainability of 
NGOs in Zambia. The study took a quantitative approach and a total of 53 respondents interviewed, out of the 65 
invited representatives of the local NGOs in Zambia. Inherent risk factors, collateral risk factors and 
environmental risk factors were used as independent variables while financial sustainability of NGOs was the 
dependent variable. Linear regression analysis was used to establish the significance of the effects and correlation 
analysis was used to establish relationships. The results showed that none of these risk factors has a significant 
negative effect on financial sustainability of NGOs in Zambia. Despite the mixed coefficient signs, no significant 
correlations were established. Thus, the study recommends a strong need for NGOs leaders to set up a clearly 
defined funding policy and the framework for tracking the financial flows of the organization. In addition, Policy 
makers should consider opening up more partnership opportunity for local NGOs and focus much on 
empowerment programmes so as to level the ground field for all NGO players in Zambia.

1. Introduction
Financial sustainability is understood as the ability of public administrations to continue now and in the future 
current policies without causing the debt to rise continuously. Financial sustainability is one of the most critical 
aspects of an organization’s success. When an organization can understand its flow of revenue generation, cause 
of revenue loss, provide and implement sound strategic planning and is able to produce multiple streams of 
revenue, this then aids the organization in the process of securing and/or obtaining financial sustainability. Being 
able to identify trends and forecast for the known and unknown assists in this process as well. Financial

Being the only variable, a simple linear regression coefficient is also the correlation coefficient. Thus, there is no 
significant correlation between environmental risk factor and financial sustainability of local NGOs in Zambia. 
 
5. Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations 
5.1 Summary of Findings 
This study sought to investigate the risk factors that affect financial sustainability of local NGOs in Zambia. Three 
risk factors were established and these are; the inherent risk factors, collateral risk factors, and the environmental 
risk factors. Each of these factors was measured using some risk components. 
 
To arrive at the findings, the study engaged 53 respondents from 53 different NGOs in Zambia. These respondents 
were the representatives and key informants in their respective NGOs. The study employed three methods of 
analysis. These were: regression analysis, correlation analysis and analysis of variance. 
The results of the study revealed that there is no significant negative effect of any of the risk factors on financial 
sustainability of local NGOs in Zambia. Further, no significant correlation was established in this study. 
5.2 Conclusions 
It is therefore concluded in this study that inherent risk factors, collateral risk factors and environmental risk 
factors are not key influencers of financial stability of the local NGOs in Zambia.  
 
5.3 Recommendations 
Based on the findings of this study, the researcher recommends the following: 
1. There is strong need for NGOs leaders to set up a clearly defined funding policy and the framework for 
tracking the financial flows of the organization 
 
2. Policy makers should consider opening more partnership opportunity for local NGOs and focus much on 
empowerment programmes so as to level the ground field for all NGO players in Zambia 
 
3. Other researchers may also take this piece of writing as a benchmark study in Zambia and extend the 
scope of this study by including other risk factors that may significantly influence financial sustainability 
of NGOs.

Abstract 
Value Analysis is the study of the features of an item and their corresponding cost concerning its ability to perform a 
function or render a service, on the other hand, Value Engineering is a technique for product or process function, 
this technique will provide significant information to the overall function of the product and process. This also 
provides information about the reduction or elimination of cost for those functions that do not add value to the 
process or product. A systematic approach is applied to maintain the required quality and reliability of the product or 
process. The design of the stainless steel rack was based on manual and automated operation, similarly, the 
fabrication process will merely depend on the design. The design of the product and process were analyzed based on 
the six criteria: VA/VE on Material, VA/VE on Product, VA/VE on Process, Material Handling Cost, 
Waste/Emission, and Life Cycle Cost. The two designs were analyzed based on the Trade-Off Analysis based on the 
perspective of the designer and customer. The results of the design evaluation for stainless steel overall satisfy 
VA/VE approach. This study recommends 304 stainless racks which have higher corrosion resistance, good 
mechanical properties, and the least life cycle cost compared to 430 materials. Total Cost savings will be achieved 
using 304 stainless steel

1. Introduction
Value Analysis is a system developed for the elimination of unnecessary costs. The concept was first introduced by 
Lawrence D. Miles back in the late 1940s. The unique part of the value analysis system is the use of “functions” to 
define products and services. It focused on understanding the function of the component being manufactured and 
questioned whether the design could be improved or if a different material or concept could achieve the function. At 
present time, new products must offer high quality and functionality for the customer at a lower price. Competition 
is always considered a major basis for a re-evaluation of existing design. Inflation, as a result of rising materials and 
labor costs, requires a thorough investigation into all techniques that can contribute towards a reduction in basic 
costs without affecting the reliability of performance. Good value has always been a major concern of the customer. 
As long as there is competition, a comparative reliable lower cost product will always have a greater market value. 
Profits are still the most important reason to evaluate the design, considering without profit there is no existence of 
businesses. The technology-based sector needs to acquire relevant technical information to survive in the present 
competitive situation. According to Lemos and Porto (1998), to improve the innovation process, Information is 
needed for firms in the technology-based field that needs to survive in the extreme marketplace. The fabrication 
Industry is one of the technology-based sectors that need relevant information to create a superior design.

Using the model of trade-off analysis per VA/VE process will give the designers ability to rank the design for every 
method such as Material, Product, Process, Material Handling, Emissions, and Life Cycle Cost.

Based on Trade-Off from Customer’s Perspective, (Table 16) In terms of Corrosion or Heat resistance, the 304 
material resulted to received a  a rank  of 5 compare to 430 who has a rank of 1.6, both with  the First Cost ( Selling 
Price), and Life Cycle Cost, all the afformentioned decision criterion resulted to a rank of 5 in fabricating stainless 
steel equipment using 304 material. The results show that fabricating 304 materials will have a higher score 
compared to 430 materials based on the computed average rank on trade-off analysis of designers' and customers' 
perspectives (Tables 15 and 16).  
5. Conclusion and Recommendation  
This paper developed a case methodology that will represent the optimum value to the manufacturer and customer 
using VA/VE approach. The method used is to analyze and interpret the results based on design ranking.  
 
The solutions show that high scores from designing a 304 material will give benefits to the manufacturer and 
customer based on Value Analysis on material, product, process, material handling cost emissions, and its product 
life cycle cost. Value Engineering is not only advantageous but also necessary because Improvements in the project's 
functioning frequently result in significant initial and life-cycle cost savings. The assurance that all plausible 
alternatives have been investigated comes from taking a ""second look"" at the design created by the designers.  A 
thorough review is done to ensure that no costs or scope statements have been overlooked or understated and best 
value will be obtained.  Future works of this case study may expand the method into a multiconstraint and multi-
objective optimization problem

Abstract 
In many industries, profitability and productivity are ongoing challenges. To increase productivity and profitability, process 
automation, innovation in technology, and process optimization are all required. Due to the intricacy of the work and the high 
manpower demands, enterprises in the autoparts manufacturing industry face supply chain challenges. A methodical strategy 
used to examine the function and its cost is Value Analysis and Value Engineering (VA/VE). It identifies a non-value-adding 
element that impedes the production of high-quality and dependable goods or processes. In this study, the wire harness 
manufacturing company used the VA/VE strategy to process optimization. Based on process VA/VE and a strategy for predicting 
human error, the production processes were examined (THERP). It draws attention to the crucial tasks involved in making wire 
harnesses. 15% of the faults in the assessment's wire assembly area involved inverted wires and incorrect assembly. A suggestion 
to enhance the assembly line process was developed using the analysis's findings

1. Introduction
In many organizations, according to Chhabra and Tripathi (2014), VA/VE is used to increase productivity and cut 
costs. This method is being used by several business and economic sectors, such as the construction, service, and 
manufacturing industries, to increase profitability. The VA/VE technique is a rational way to examine how 
processes, machinery, facilities, services, and supplies perform in order to carry out their fundamental tasks at the 
lowest possible life-cycle cost. It is an effective tool for fixing system flaws and planning performance 
enhancements for any procedure or good. By concentrating on the functions that contribute the most to problems 
and their most likely causes, it is applied to produce noticeable improvements in quality and reliability (Sison et.al. 
2018)  
The Philippines has a thriving wire harness manufacturing business. In actuality, wire harness exports from the 
Philippines were ranked third worldwide (Sturgeon 2016). The auto parts sector, in which wire harness goods are 
essential elements, is expanding at a rapid rate alongside the automotive sector. However, despite this rapidly 
expanding need, the Philippines only has a small number of enterprises that produce wire harness goods.

4. Results and Discussion 
The Process VA/VE demonstrates that most production line activities require additional reductions in operational 
costs in order to boost their value. Processes that don't add value, like mistakes in the wire harness assembly line, are 
stopped. The sub-process of placing the wire into its housing had the highest mistake probability, with a value of 
0.4, according to the technique used to forecast human error. The suggested change concentrated on how to enhance 
this component of the process. The production's 13% productivity was verified by ProModel Simulation. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The wire harness production process was optimized in this work utilizing the VA/VE strategy. The answer 
demonstrates how conducting a functional analysis on a production's key process and taking the necessary 
immediate action can potentially result in considerable increases in output and profit.

Abstract 
Electronic waste in Indonesia continues to grow at an alarming rate. It is estimated that by 2040, the amount of e-
waste generated will reach almost double the current amount. If not addressed, this condition will directly or indirectly 
negatively impact life aspects such as the environment, health, society, and economy. Currently, Indonesia's e-waste 
management efforts still rely on general rules that do not specifically regulate e-waste, such as the Law on Hazardous 
and Toxic Waste. In addition, research needs to discuss e-waste management strategies in Indonesia from a multi-
actor perspective. To fill this gap, this article aims to develop relevant e-waste management strategies to be 
implemented in Indonesia from a multi-actor perspective. The initial stage of this research is to collect e-waste 
management strategies that have been implemented or proposed from various works of literature. Furthermore, the 
list of strategies that have been collected is assessed for their relevance on a four-level integer scale by experts from 
the government, non-government organizations, electronics manufacturers, recyclers, and academia which represent 
the stakeholders involved in the decision-making of e-waste management. Then, the validation process is carried out 
using the content validity index (CVI) method, where the results of this method will show consensus and valid 
strategies that are important for policymakers and researchers in the future.

1. Introduction
The use of electrical and electronic devices is essential in people's lives. Electronic equipment is one of the main 
aspects supporting productivity and improving human living standards. Besides these benefits, the extensive use of 
electronic equipment has a fairly worrying impact because electronic waste is currently a global problem. Forti et al. 
(2020) show that in 2019, the world generated 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste, and only 17.4% of this amount was 
recorded as properly collected and recycled. Indonesia's condition is no better than the condition of global e-waste 
management. This is proven by the fact that in 2019 only 10% of e-waste in Indonesia was processed by the formal 
sector (Yunita et al. 2019). Even though Indonesia itself in 2019 produced quite a large amount of electronic waste, 
as much as 1.6 million metric tons, which placed Indonesia as the fourth largest producer of electronic waste in Asia. 
Various factors cause the rapid growth of e-waste globally, such as technological developments, increased purchasing 
power of new products, population growth, market penetration, and high obsolescence rates (Arora, 2008). In addition, 
factors like the ineffective supply chain mechanism for electronic products and product waste between formal 
stakeholders and the involvement of the informal sector significantly affect the high level of waste produced at the 
end of the cycle (Li et al. 2010). In fact, if managed seriously, electronic waste generates not only economic benefits 
but also gives social and environmental benefits. From an economic point of view, e-waste recycling will prevent the 
wastage of resources such as metals, plastics, and chemicals used as well as the energy and costs required to produce 
and mine them. From a social perspective, many people will be employed to fulfill the recycling resources of electronic 
waste, including the potential for utilization/conversion of the informal sector to become formal. In addition, the 
community's financial stability will improve due to more jobs. From an environmental perspective, implementing

Finally, from this study, 26 strategies were considered valid. Overall, all strategy items are considered valid on 
legislations, systems, and social dimensions. As for the economics dimension, three strategies are considered invalid, 
which are ""Recycling & collection of subsidies"", ""Pollution tax for non-participants"", and ""Transparency & monitoring 
of the finance practices"". The strategy ""Recycling & collection of subsidies"" is considered invalid by recyclers and 
the government. This is because even though this strategy seems to benefit recyclers in the future, they argue that this 
strategy is not yet urgent to be implemented in Indonesia because, currently, the profit generated from e-waste 
management by the formal sector is still high. ""Pollution tax for non-participants"" is also considered invalid by the 
government and recyclers. They argue that the government has required producers to be responsible for the waste they 
produce. There are also sanctions that apply to violators, so the tax on non-participants is considered less relevant. 
The strategy “Transparency & monitoring of the finance practices” is considered invalid by NGOs, recyclers, and 
companies. They argue that recyclers set their costs individually, and they consider it to be a company secret, so it 
will be difficult to be transparent. Meanwhile, from the producer's point of view, this cost transparency will be 
burdensome, and it is feared that it will harm the brand image if they do not contribute but still benefit from the 
implemented e-waste management program. Even so, they think this strategy can be implemented, but not in the near 
future (5-10 years). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Research on e-waste management is crucial for Indonesia as a country still not well established in e-waste 
management. This research provides a new reference regarding the future strategies that might be applied in e-waste 
management in Indonesia. From the results of the literature review conducted, we identified 29 strategies. Experts 
then validated this list of strategies. From the validation process, it was determined that there were 26 strategies from 
four dimensions (3 economic strategies, 9 legislative strategies, 6 systems strategies, and 8 social strategies) that were 
valid because they obtained an I-CVI/Ave value above 0.80. As for S-CVI/Ave, a value of 0.92 was found, which an 
excellent validity value for content is. However, if we use the universal average approach, there are only 16 valid 
strategies with an S-CVI/UA value of 0.62. We recommend using the average approach considering the possibility of 
bias and misunderstanding by experts. 
In future research, we recommend using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to analyze the driving 
and dependence power of the strategies in the implementation of electronic waste management. Besides that, an 
analysis of the interrelationships between strategies and strategy prioritization can also be carried out.

Abstract 
This research seeks to spread the use of the Single minute exchange of die (SMED) tool. According to the literature 
reviewed, there are few investigations where this tool is applied in companies in the food sector. The objective of the 
study is to conduct an analysis of the research carried out on the implementation of the SMED tool in the food industry. 
A systematic review of the literature was implemented, 3 categories and 7 study subcategories were formed to analyze 
30 articles published between 2015 and 2021. It was found that 64% of the articles were concentrated between 2017 
and 2019, and that 43% were made in Latin America. Also, it was found that work methods are the main cause that 
affects the changeover time and 67% of the articles reviewed mention the increase in productivity as the main benefit. 
The principal obstacle to the implementation of this methodology is the lack of staff training. The major limitation 
found in this research is that the cost reduction calculations mentioned are not detailed. For future research, it is 
recommended to detail the quantification of cost reduction after SMED implementation.

1. Introduction
The food industry has a large share in the manufacturing sector, since it produces basic necessities. In Peru, according 
to the Ministry of Production (2020), the food industry represents 32.8% of the manufacturing sector; likewise, the 
Banco Central del Perú (2021) mentions that this sector represents 12% of the country's GDP; therefore, its contribution 
to the economy is significant. As a result, it was decided to investigate what management problems the companies in 
this area had in common, resulting in the food industry presenting problems of excessive time losses in die changes in 
machines due to factors such as lack of work methodology (Lozano et al. 2017). According to previous studies, every 
factory in Europe loses at least 5% of its productivity due to downtime, and some lose up to 20% in Latin America 
(Reyna, 2020). 
In order to improve the productivity of manufacturing companies, several management tools are being used, among 
them Lean manufacturing. Specifically, to reduce machine setup times, the SMED methodology is used, which seeks 
to reduce changeover times and achieve to perform each activity in the shortest possible time (Pantoja and Castrillón 
2017). However, lean tools are not widely used in food industries due to the unique characteristics of this sector, i.e., 
short shelf life, heterogeneous raw materials, and seasonality. In addition, barriers such as large and inflexible 
machinery, long installation time, and resource complexity, has limited the implementation and impact of lean practices 
in Process Industries in general (Maalouf and Zaduminska 2019).  
1.1 Objectives 
The purpose of this study is to conduct a literature review to determine the benefits of the SMED methodology, the 
main causes that affect production time in the food sector industries, the countries that have conducted more studies 
on the subject, the main contributions found by the authors, the characteristics of SMED implementation and how to 
apply it in industrial companies in the food sector, with the purpose of spread this information among the sector’s 
entrepreneurs.

In reference to the subcategory implementation limitations, only 10 articles were found to detail them, i.e. 30% of the 
total, as shown in  Table 5: 
 
Table 5. Authors and implementation limitations 
 
Authors 
Limitations 
Sarria et al. (2017) 
Management gaps and difficult to hire highly qualified personnel due to budget 
constraints. 
Bento Da Silva and Godinho 
(2019). 
Tool selection is one of the main management challenges that can determine the 
success of the smed technique. 
Borges et al. (2015). 
Most of the time-consuming tasks were related to calibration and adjustments on 
the machine (start-up period), which could not be reduced to ensure quality. 
Lozano et al. (2017) 
To apply this study, it is not possible to use just any Lean Manufacturing tool, 
since the point is to properly define the tasks, organize them and then optimize 
them. Therefore, one of the main limitations of the study is the impossibility of 
using any tool that cannot be adapted to optimize the supply chain. 
Maalouf and Zaduminska 
(2019) 
The relatively limited application of lean in food processing industries has been 
attributed to the unique characteristics of the food sector, i.e., short shelf life, 
heterogeneous raw materials, and seasonality. 
Gálová (2018) 
The most critical phase is phase one, in which it is necessary to divide all the 
activities, if it is not done correctly, the expected results will not be obtained. 
Parwani and Hu (2021) 
There may be other influencing factors, such as safety procedures in a 
manufacturing environment, that could increase changeover time. This case study 
does not take such influences into account. 
Sousa et al. (2018) 
It is important to emphasize that a good working environment, trust in employees 
and cooperation among all are fundamental to the success of any project; this fact 
is even clearer in a project of this type that requires the participation of everyone 
and the prospect of a change in the way work is done. 
Ahmad and Soberi (2018) 
Although SMED is promoted as one of the methods for changeover time 
reduction, it is not a generic method that applies in all cases, it was stated that 
conventional SMED is only suitable in systems consisting of a single machine and 
a worker.  
Filla (2016) 
Distribution and synchronization of activities. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The purpose of this study was to conduct a literature review to determine the main benefit, characteristics, and 
contributions found by the authors about the SMED methodology. 
 
It was found that the main benefit of implementing the SMED methodology, mentioned by 67% of the articles 
reviewed, is the increase in productivity, reducing die change time by up to 49.43%. Also, the authors describe other 
benefits such as increased flexibility, quality, lower costs and lot size reduction. Likewise, it was found that the 
principal cause affecting die change time is inadequate work methods and that the main obstacle for the implementation 
of this methodology is the lack of personnel training.  
 
On the other hand, of the 30 articles reviewed, it was found that 64% were published between 2017 and 2019, and 43% 
of the studies were conducted in Latin America. 
 
The main limitation of the research is that the articles reviewed do not detail the quantification of the reduction of costs 
after the implementation of SMED, so it is recommended that for future studies a more detailed explanation of the 
calculation be made, since some articles only mention the value of savings or the percentage reduction. 
 
Finally, the main contribution of this research from a business point of view is that it will promote the implementation 
of SMED in food industries in order to reduce production times and increase productivity.

Abstrack 
Recently, research in food supply chain management (FSCM) continues to grow, especially in the era of the COVID-19 
pandemic, which can change the direction of research. This study presents a bibliometric analysis to develop trends in 
the FSCM study. Descriptive statistical analysis of the literature review study method using VOSviewer software aims 
to identify and classify the framework of thinking that explains the problem-solving used in FSCM researchers so that 
the proposed future research direction can be known. Quantitative data comes from articles indexed by Scopus. The total 
number of pieces is 241 showing that the University of Wageningen tops the list with seven by publication. Based on the 
most prolific author, out of a total of 64 authors with at least two documents, the author Iakovou e. topped the rankings 
with five articles, 208 citations, and a total link strength of 9. By country, China tops the list with 34 publications with 
533 medals. In conclusion, the development of the number of publications on Scopus based on the article titled ""food 
supply chain management"" during 1997-2021 shows that the number of studies has increased significantly.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic first occurred in 2019 and spread throughout 2020, devastatingly impacting almost all sectors, 
especially the food crisis that occurred in several parts of the country. This was caused by several factors, including high 
consumer demand, changing consumer buying patterns, and panic buying. From the supply chain side, there were 
disruptions, such as labor shortages and transportation delays. One of the sciences that examines the food supply chain 
is Food Supply Chain Management (Hobbs 2020). FSCM has been created to describe the activities or operations of 
production, distribution, and consumption to maintain the safety and quality of various foods efficiently and effectively 
(Zhong et al. 2017). The FSCM framework is the basis for making, processing, and transforming raw materials and semi-
finished products from primary activities such as forestry, agriculture, and so on (Dubey et al. 2017). The difference

5.6 Discussion 
Based on the results of an analysis using data from a total of 241 publications sourced from Scopus and processed using 
VOSviewer software, the result is that this bibliometric research can be used as a benchmark for determining novelty for 
research that has never been carried out on the theme ""food supply chain management."" The number of publications is 
based on affiliation, and Wageningen University and Research's highest position was generated, with seven publications. 
Based on a total of 64 authors with at least two documents, it is known that the author with the most documents is Iakovou 
e. with a total of 5 documents and 208 citations. The results of the statistical analysis obtained show that the development 
of the number of FSCM publications on Scopus based on the article titled ""food supply chain management"" has proven 
to have increased from the first year, namely 1997 to 2021. 
 
Research developments can also be seen based on the subject area to determine the study's scope. Table 3. shows the 
development of FSCM research based on the subject area for the last five years. Based on the shift in the research study 
area, it can be seen that research has increased in 2020-2021, after the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the ""Business, 
Management, and Accounting"" area. This shows that more research is being carried out due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which has affected all sectors, including the economy. Many business people have experienced declines and losses, so 
FSCM's research helps improve work systems for economic recovery, which is a problem in many countries. In addition, 
FSCM has also experienced increased research in the subject area ""Engineering"" and ""Computer Science.""

6. Conclusion 
Food Supply Chain Management (FSCM) research continues to increase over time. After the COVID-19 pandemic, 
numbers were shifted based on the research subject area, which shows that a phenomenon that occurs can affect the 
research direction. The current FSCM field of study and future research can be connected with sustainability science to 
pay more attention to economic, social and environmental aspects.

Abstract 
This paper aims to analyse several parameters of the casualty evacuation system and their effects through the 
simulation platform. A discrete event simulation (DES) model is used for the analysis. Five scenarios contemplating 
different fleets' prerequisites for survival, ambulance allocation and casualty treatment allocation parameters are used 
to test the performance of the military evacuation system. The result shows that change in parameters such as 
ambulance return time, redeployment time, transport duration etc., effects the time of evacuation as well as the time 
of resuscitation and damage control surgery. The percentage of casualties that required damage control surgery that 
received it within the required time is on average, 63.78 % and the waiting time for bed is 0 minutes. In order to 
facilitate the evacuation of combat casualties, this simulation model supports decision-making. This analysis can also 
be used to support the resource allocation of the military casualty evacuation system.

1. Introduction
Evacuating the wounded from the battlefield has been a persistent problem since the dawn of warfare, and it remains 
the same as today (Lam 2001). The movement of casualties is a significant component of military medical health 
systems. To enhance the individual’s prognosis and reduce long-term disability, in casualty evacuation en route, 
medical care and emergency medical intervention are provided according to the medical requirements (ATP 4-02.2 
2019). It plays a vital role in saving the lives of combat casualties and reducing the rate of mortality and morbidity. 
Since World War II, warfare has seen tremendous changes (Moses et al. 2001). Nowadays, the application of emerging 
technologies (war drones, nuclear weapons) has constantly been changing the nature of the battlefield and 
unfortunately, leading to raise in the severity of casualties. The nonlinear and enlarged nature of the modern battlefield 
necessitates modifications in the way combat health assistance is provided (Moses et al. 2001). Maintaining the 
fighting units' care becomes increasingly crucial for the success or failure of the mission as the battlefield gets more 
dangerous. It is evident that future operating environments will give rise to new clinical, logistics and organisational 
challenges (Scallan et al. 2020). Therefore, an effective evacuation system can be provided by military with 
comprehensive planning, which ultimately improves the likelihood of the injured soldier surviving (Moses et al. 2001).
In order to examine military systems, numerical models are frequently developed as war games, and field training 
exercises are exceedingly expensive (Eubanks et al. 2020). The military evacuation system is dynamic in nature and 
contains many stochastic characteristics. Hence, the simulation tool would be the optimal approach for modelling and 
analysing the system. 
1.1 Objectives 
Our study aims to analyse the casualty evacuation system of the military through simulation. A technique known as 
discrete event simulation (DES) is used to simulate real-world systems that may be divided into a number of logically 
distinct processes that advance independently across time (Med. upenn). DES is a method for imitating the behaviour 
and functionality of a process, facility, or system in real life (Allen 2015). In our paper, we use DES as our simulation

From the scenario analysis, it is found that the change in the input parameters has a minor effect on the distribution 
times. It is observed that input parameters have a minor effect on casualty estimation, such as arriving of casualties 
and the active number of casualties. The parameters have a significant impact on bed occupancy and on the waiting 
time for beds. In addition, the result shows that there is a strong relationship between the number of casualties and 
ambulance allocation. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Time is a very crucial factor for any evacuation system. It is directly related to casualty survivability. On the other 
hand, proper casualty treatment by providing sufficient logistic support such as beds and transport can make the 
evacuation system efficient. 
 
This study has been conducted to analyse the casualty evacuation system and support the military in decision-making. 
Evacuation time, resuscitation time and damage control time are evaluated based on different scenarios. Casualty 
estimation and ambulance allocation to transport casualty are also assessed based on several input parameters in the 
simulation model. It is found that there is a direct relation between the input parameters and the performance of the 
evacuation system. However, there are still some shortcomings; for example, it is not enough to come up with a 
decision by considering a few parameters for analysis. As the evacuation system is a complex system, several factors 
are related to its performance that needs to be considered altogether. Therefore, further rigorous analysis is needed to 
make efficient such a complex system like the military evacuation process that can assist the defence planner and 
decision maker.

Abstract 
The Indonesian Jewelry Industry is a leading sector in the economy with an export value of USD 5.42 billion in 2021. 
The high export value is certainly triggered by local companies working in running their businesses. One of the local 
jewelry companies in Indonesia running the gold jewelry business is PT Sentral Kreasi Kencana (PT SKK). PT SKK 
is a subsidiary of CMK Group, which is the largest jewelry manufacturer in Southeast Asia and started its business in 
the 1970s. During running its business, PT SKK faced several problems in the production department. One of them is 
the managing of raw materials for jewelry in manufacturing. Therefore, an information system is designed for raw 
material requirements for PT SKK. The design of this information system uses the System Development Life Cycle 
(SDLC) method. Furthermore, it was designed a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to describe the flow of data in the 
information system, Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to describe the entity relationships in the database and the 
information system. The impact of this information system design is to help PT SKK to eliminated idle time during 
manufacture process.

1. Introduction
The jewelry industry in Indonesia is one of the leading sectors that contributes to the economy. This can be seen from 
the high export value of Indonesian jewelry products. In 2020, the export value of Indonesian jewelry products 
increased by 24.21% compared to the previous year. Then, in 2021, the value of Indonesian jewelry exports will reach 
USD 5.42 billion. Throughout 2021, the value of Indonesian jewelry exports fluctuated. 
In today's era, market behavior is changing so fast and so many demands of the desired variety of demands in the 
jewelry industry. This makes a product or service provider entity need to respond to the fluctuating level of market 
demand that is so fast and unpredictable and ensure that it can always meet market demand. In this case, the 
information system is considered a very important pillar for an entity that provides products and services such as the 
food industry, beverage industry, automotive industry, and even industries engaged in fashion such as jewelry. 
Jewelry manufacturers in Indonesia produce various kinds of bracelets, earrings, rings, necklaces, pendants, bracelets, 
brooches, etc. These products are combined with 75.5%, 70.8%, 68.0%, and 37.5% gold grades and are further 
combined with White, Yellow, and rosegold colors. there are more than ten combinations produced every month, the 
product combinations can be seen in Table 1 below.

Design reccomended system is the stage of applying the designs that have been previously designed. This research 
has been implemented into company Google Sheets for database the materials, system, name, etc so that they can be 
accessed by management and users. Manufacture’s are now starts working without any doubt that will shortage of 
materials because there’s department who manage. The idle time also eliminated because of this implementation. 
5. Conclusions and Future Research 
Based on the analysis and discussion that has been carried out previously, using the System Development Life Cycle 
(SDLC) method, an information system design is produced that is able to store, recapitulate , as well as displaying the 
need for raw materials for jewelry in jewelry manufacturing. The system is expected to be able to collect raw material 
control data. 
 
Data flow diagram (DFD) was built as a material for designing the data flow of the information system. The DFD that 
is built is a context DFD, and a level 1 DFD. An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is also built to describe the design 
of the database on the information system.

The impact from the design of information systems is an increase in the efficiency inventory management and 
eliminated idle time for production. Due to limited pages format not all implementation figures are include. This study 
only provide four out of seven stages of SDLC due to limited time. For future research need to finish all stages of 
SDLC.

Abstract 
This study compares knowledge sourcing strategies (KSS) employed, and innovation performed, by manufacturing 
firms in high-income (HI) and middle-income (MI) countries using global innovation data derived from the UNESCO 
Institute for Statistics (UIS). KSS consists of both closed innovation (internal R&D) and open innovation. This study 
provides new empirical evidence at country level on the link between KSS and innovation across manufacturing firms 
in HI and MI countries. In the case of R&D activities, evidence from this study reveals that there is a significant 
different between manufacturing firms in HI and MI countries. Manufacturing firms in the former group of country is 
significantly performing internal R&D greater than in the latter group of country. Within HI and MI economies, 
practicing open innovation in isolation alone does not lead to high level of innovation output.  Evidence from HI 
countries shows that other factors such as R&D activities and R& investment that is also supported by IPRs are 
correlated to innovation. The key contribution of this study is to provide new empirical evidence on the comparison 
of KSS – innovation association in the context HI and MI countries that to date is relatively few. Relevant theoretical 
and practical implication are drawn from this study.

1. Introduction
Successful innovation depends not only on firms’ internal competencies but also on their ability to absorb external 
knowledge and technologies (e.g., Cassiman and Veugelers 2006; Roper et al. 2010; Segarra-Blasco and Arauzo-
Carod 2008). Therefore, searching for new ideas to solve firms’ existing problems increasingly goes beyond the firm 
boundaries in order to explore other institutions’ capacities (Vega-Jurado, Gracia, and de-Lucio 2009). However, 
firms’ search strategies critically rely on their ability to recognize and exploit external knowledge to be used in the 
innovation process, as the concept of absorptive capacity highlights (Cohen and Levinthal 1989, 1990). In addition, 
nowadays, the innovation process is viewed as a highly interactive process, and as a result, firms tend to rely on both 
internal and external knowledge (Tödtling  et al.  2011). Consequently, a critical issue for firms is to determine and 
balance the sources of knowledge that most influence their innovation output and innovation performance, i.e., 
whether it comes from internal or external sources or both, as well as any factors that hinder their knowledge sourcing 
strategies (KSS). 
KSS is defined as “a firm’s approach to generating incoming knowledge flows through knowledge creation or 
knowledge acquirement” (Wen Lin and Hung Wu 2010, p.582). According to Roper, Du and Love (2008) the main 
part of the knowledge sourcing activity consists in assembling the different types of knowledge used for innovation. 
“Firms may interact via various ways to access knowledge outside their boundaries” and “interaction is a key concept 
for knowledge creation and innovation” (Caloghirou et al. 2004, p. 29). Therefore, firms strongly rely on networks, 
collaboration and partnerships in which they are able to access resources, knowledge and information, which is then 
circulated rapidly at low cost (Chesbrough and Teece 1996). In this study, KSS is divided into closed or internal – 
KSS and open innovation – KSS in order to contrast closed versus open innovation against innovation performed by 
manufacturing firms in high-income (HI) and middle-income (MI) countries.

Abstract 
Indonesia has an alarming safety level leading to the ban to fly to other countries from 2007 to 2018. Even though the 
government and the aviation industry in Indonesia have tried to resolve this problem, reports from the Indonesia 
National Transportation Safety Committee have shown that up until 2021 there were notable numbers of accidents 
and incidents resulting in a number of fatalities. In this paper, the authors aim to propose a framework for the 
improvement of the continuous airworthiness business process. We gathered the data from the available studies and 
applicable regulations. Interviews and surveys were conducted with airworthiness experts in Indonesia to define the 
critical success factors of continuous airworthiness. Then, we analyzed the current quality process in an Indonesian 
low-cost carrier airline with the compliance management framework. The study shows that the existing business 
process lacks the critical control point in accordance with the applicable regulation. For further research, business 
process reengineering can be carried out to take the compliance management process into account.

1. Introduction
As the world’s largest archipelagic country with a size of almost 2 million square km, air transportation has a crucial 
role in Indonesia. With more than 250 million citizens who live on more than 17,000 islands across the country, air 
transport is a key factor in increasing connectivity which results in economic growth. Even though air transportation 
is highly important in Indonesia, Indonesia has a problem with the lack of assurance level on safety (Dachyar and 
Siva, 2016).  
In 2007 there were 2 accidents resulting in hundreds of fatalities in Indonesia. This resulted in a ban from other aviation 
authorities. On 16 April 2007, FAA reduced Indonesia's aviation safety ratings to category 2, which means it is not in 
conformance with the ICAO safety standards. On 4 July 2007, European Union issued Commission Regulation (EC) 
No. 787-2007 to ban all Indonesian airlines to fly to Europe. Government and industry experts successfully 
implemented some changes and the ban was lifted in 2018. Although currently there is no restriction from other 
countries as it was before, the safety report shows that the safety problem still exists. According to National 
Transportation Safety Committee, there are 45 accidents and 112 serious incidents occurred in Indonesia from 2017 
to 2021.  
This problem if remains unsolved may be resulting in another accident and fatalities. Some study has looked into the 
problem of safety and quality assurance in Indonesian air transportation (Pramono et al., 2020;  Pramono et al., 2018). 
He mentioned that airworthiness management is the process to ensure that an aircraft is in airworthy condition and 
safe to operate. This process should have been in place within the Indonesian airline's procedures as it is mandated by

Established an audit record system 
The airworthiness compliance management framework can be used to determine the control point that should be added 
to the continuous analysis and surveillance process. The process itself should consist of several processes that are 
well-connected between each process. Information technology should be used to improve the process of continuous 
analysis and surveillance to help the airline gather the data needed, lay the facts, and deliver the data within time. 
5.2 Airworthiness Compliance Management 
In this section, we use the compliance management model proposed by (Schumm et al., 2010) to develop the 
airworthiness compliance management model. Critical success factors used as the continuous airworthiness best 
practices as the internalized compliance requirement

Table 4 showing the airworthiness compliance management framework gives a clear picture of the incorporation of 
the regulation into the control point that an airline needs. The control point that we determined can be used as a 
performance indicator to trigger an audit.  
6. Conclusion
To have a continuous airworthiness business process that fully complies with the requirements and is effective to 
maintain the safety level of the airline is critical for the future of the company. A thorough analysis of compliance 
management is sometimes forgotten if the process has been implemented in a long time or has been approved by the 
competent authority without a deeper analysis of the process effectivity. The study that we conducted on the audit 
process of an Indonesian low-cost airline can reach to these conclusion: 1. An organization can neglect an existing 
compliance issue on the business process once a process has been approved by the competent authority, 2. Continuous 
improvement is important in compliance management to be able to keep the compliance to ever changing regulation. 
Future research on the improvement of the business process is needed to propose a framework for the improvement 
of Indonesia's aviation safety.

Abstract 
Warehouses are fast-paced environments where workers must collaborate to safely and quickly complete tasks. They 
will also need to pay close attention and work hard to keep things running smoothly. This research focuses on the 
variables that influence warehouse workers' performance efficiency and productivity, as well as how these variables 
can lead to inconsistent performance and unproductive workers. It also aims to provide knowledge on warehouses 
about the factors that influence the warehouse workers productivity and efficiency. The organization will gain how to 
make more informed decisions, complete tasks more effectively, and improve management. Additionally, the 
researchers want to make warehouse stakeholders aware of the significance of these factors to an organization. This 
study will show the company that fixing issues in this area boosts output and enhances worker performance. This 
research will focus on the warehouse workers in Taytay, Rizal. The proponents aim to determine the factors that affect 
the performance efficiency and productivity of the workers. The data will be gathered on 100 warehouse workers that 
are currently employed in Taytay, Rizal, Philippines.  The researcher used the following process to gather information 
regarding the specific factors affecting the performance efficiency and productivity of warehouse workers in Rizal. 
The researcher utilizes different platforms to gather data, and evaluation/survey questionnaires as ways to obtain the 
information by having the warehouse worker answer or fill out the evaluation questionnaire. The researchers involved 
descriptive statistics to contain the data in a way that offers a complete understanding of the data. Excel and Minitab 
were used in the data collection and analysis. In order to identify the various elements influencing the performance 
and productivity of warehouse workers, the central tendency measurements were also used to determine the level of 
correlation and the relative contributions of each predictor to the relationship, the researchers also conducted a multiple 
regression analysis on a result (the dependent variable). The researchers used the Pairwise Pearson's Correlation 
Technique to assess the strength and direction of the correlation between two linearly related continuous variables. It 
is used to examine whether performance efficiency and productivity have a connection to the different factors.

As stated by Johnson, B. (n.d.). A warehouse is a substantial structure where produced items or raw materials are 
stored until they are exported to other areas or delivered to retail locations for purchase. The ability to control the 
differences between the arriving and outgoing flows of products is made possible by a warehouse, which also includes 
storage racks, handling tools, staff, and management resources. As stated by Airspeed International Corporation (n.d.). 
The most cost-effective option to easily handle the items for distribution is through warehousing in the Philippines. 
These warehouses provide a lot of inventory space and a good management system at a reasonable cost. The

Abstract 
This research is designed in order to respond to the phenomenon of tourism shifting trends from sightseeing natural 
landscape to physical health and mental recovery. Guided by therapeutic landscape theory and Attention Restoration 
Theory (ART), this study is developed to examine the relationship among the therapeutic landscape (physical, 
symbolic and social landscape) to restorative experience and health perception. This research is planned to be carried 
out in three provinces in Indonesia (Jogjakarta, Central Java and East Java) with tourism destinations which represent 
the therapeutic landscape contexts. Quantitative approach is chosen as a research method, by distributing 
questionnaires online to tourist respondents. Four propositions were developed to explain the relationship between the 
therapeutic landscape, restorative experiences and the health perception. Restorative experience is proposed as 
mediating variable between the therapeutic landscape and health perception. The contribution of this research is so 
that tourism management has more innovative steps to meet the aspects of recovery and health that are increasingly 
becoming tourism demands today. Theoretically, is to enrich tourism literature which connect between tourism and 
health.

1. Introduction
The shift in motivation for travel that emphasize on health fulfillment is increasing in the community, especially after 
the Covid-19 pandemic where people becoming more concerned on health. Health according to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) is "" a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of 
disease or infirmity"" then ""There is no health without mental health"". This means that health includes the whole 
physical, mental and social. The changing trend from travelling for sightseeing the nature to activities meeting the 
health needs such as trekking, cycling, hot springs bath, spa, visiting to religious places and to flower gardens, are 
increasing sharply. The increasing economic growth and heavier workload make higher number of people 
experiencing burnout and physically exhausted. Traveling for relaxation or exercising are some options to restore for 
healthier physical and mental conditions. 
Tourism destinations cannot be separated from the place and the life that fills it. The Therapeutic Landscape Theory 
and Attention Restorative Theory (ATR) explain that the place (the object of destination) can have an impact on health 
recovery because of the combination of the physical place and the life (human, plants, animals) that fills it (Lehto, 
2013; Roostika, 2019; Zhang, et. al., 2021). Departing from these two theories, it is very important that the government 
and tourism managers to give more attention about providing more portions on health tourism as to improve their 
current tourism programs. According to the therapeutic landscape theory, beautiful places, religious places and places 
where you can gather with friends can have impacts on restoring physical and mental health. Of the many tourism 
studies, there are still very limited research that focus on health tourism, particularly on therapeutic and restorative 
(recovery) impacts on health (physical and mental) (Zhang, et. al., 2021). Research by Lehto (2013) and Rosenbaum,

5. Conclusion
This research is designed in order to respond to the shifts in tourism trends that are meeting more for health needs. 
Using the theoretical basis of therapeutic landscape and Attention Restoration Theory (ART), this study builds a model 
that connects the therapeutic landscape (physical landscape, symbolic landscape and social landscape), restorative 
experience and health perception. Restorative experience consisting of five dimensions (limited extent, fascination, 
compatibility, being away mentally"" and ""being away physically) act as a mediating variable of the relationship 
between the therapeutic landscape and the perception of health. The conceptual model of this research is also 
strengthened by the condition of the post-pandemic community which shows higher demand on a healthier lifestyle 
and chooses healthy tourist activities. This research will survey tourists who travel, especially in three provinces in 
Indonesia, namely Jogjakarta, Central Java and East Java. These three areas cover diversity of destinations that have 
symbolic, physical and social landscape. Quantitative research methods are selected by distributing questionnaires 
online.  
The SEM statistical analysis tool (Smart PLS) will be used in analyzing the data due to the presence of two multivariate 
variables in the proposed model concept (landscape therapeutic - physical, symbolic and social) and (restorative 
experiences - extent, fascination, compatibility, being away mentally and being away physically). The contribution of 
this research will theoretically enrich the lack of literature in the field of tourism that combines with health aspects, 
especially the restorative effect of destinations. In addition, for tourism manager, they should be more aware on the 
health motivations underlying why people traveling. This awareness is important for the tourism management to 
develop better destination strategies that cover greater health related benefits in tourism industry.

Abstract 
Software development in IT companies is a whole process, so it is important to define the ideal methodology before 
starting a project. This study describes the literature on project management in 2 periods 2010-2019 and 2020-2021, 
through a bibliometric review of research indexed in Scopus and Web of Science. The VosViewer tool has been used to 
visualize the relationships between authors and keywords. A total of 666 publications related to agile methodologies were 
identified during 2010-2021. The institutions with the highest publishing activity were concentrated in the US, Brazil and 
Germany. The co-authorship and co-occurrence analyze of keywords show the main authors and research sources in both 
periods. Publications on agile methodologies in IT companies have been increasing in the last 2 years. In this research, 
the main authors, journals, thematic areas, institutions, countries and cases of greater scientific relevance were analyzed. 
Keywords 
Agile Methodologies, Project Management, Scrum, Software and IT. 
1. Introduction
Agile methodologies for software development arise from the frustration of various developers, leaders and administrators 
with the classic methodologies, since these had drawbacks and presented a high risk for companies. When any of these 
methodologies did not meet the objectives, the company that owned the project lost its reputation and was severely 
affected financially (Cimolini and Cannell 2012). That is why, at present, more and more organizations implement agile 
methodologies, which is why the case studies that are carried out about these implementations increase. 
A framework that meets the appropriate parameters for optimal project management is Scrum, which delves into project 
management tasks, using adaptive planning and incremental development of projects with deliveries in short periods of 
time, this includes a set of good practices for teamwork in order to obtain a good result in an assigned project. 
The use of Scrum is directed to projects in complex environments, where immediate results are required, the requirements 
are changing or poorly defined, where innovation, competitiveness, flexibility and productivity are essential. Likewise, 
(Alsaber 2020) regarding Scrum states that: The methodology achieves success by facilitating autonomous and

From the results of Table 3 it can be seen that 80% of the most relevant studies have a prominence percentile between 
80 and 97,265. With respect to each article with its respective journal within the selected studies, it can be seen that 
10 of them have more than 30 citations each. On the other hand, the study with the highest number of citations was 
(Serrador and Pinto 2015), which was published in the first period. 
 
Identifies non-traditional methods to counteract the dangers of traditional methods that often lead to software 
development phenomena, thus testing the effect of Agile in managing their organizations in two dimensions of the 
project. Meanwhile, (Ahimbisibwe et al. 2015) does a previous investigation related to the direction of software 
development projects where he recognizes that contingency has not been fully incorporated as moderation and 
proposes to fully develop A Contingency Adjustment Perspective on Software Development Driving Agile 
Methodologies. Other investigations (Drury-Grogan et al. 2014) and (Guinan et al. 2019) summarize projects as an 
iteration of objectives and decisions managed in a work team. It seems logical that this set of decisions would lead to 
successful management and even agile software development working in two-week iterations. 
 
To finalize this concept, Gaete et al. (2021) mentions the following: Agile methods take advantage of gaining space 
and importance in the Software Engineering discipline because they have proven to be much more efficient in 
environments of high uncertainty and change compared to traditional software development methods. 
 
Likewise, the author Hernández (2017) states the following: Agile methods have gained popularity in recent years due 
to the better responsiveness they present compared to traditional methods, to market demands. For this reason, 
organizations saw the need to apply new agile methods, since they bring with them many benefits. 
 
4. Discussion 
It is evident that the period with the highest number of publications of agile methodologies in the IT sector was in the 
years 2010-2019, which may be due to the fact that more years are considered; however, the second chapter presents 
more publications per year, as a result of the implementation of scientific policies to promote research in this field due 
to the current crisis. 
 
Of the articles published in the second period, almost none are related to Covid 19, since it is a recent topic and there 
may not be enough information about the impact of the pandemic on the IT sector of the different countries. The 
institutions with the highest number of project management publications in both the first and second periods are 
concentrated in Brazil and Germany. According to a UNESCO report, the number of publications from Brazilian 
institutions has increased since 2018 due to the constant training in professional development and continuous 
evaluation of students and professionals (Borja et al. 2021). Of the institutions that published studies related to the 
implementation of agile methodologies, several in Brazil and one in South Africa (University of Johannesburg) stand 
out. The latter may be due to the fact that the South African National Board has proposed strategies to support research 
and development programs for trainees (Burns 2020). 
 
Regarding the analysis of co-authorship, it is observed that in the first period they have had greater editorial activity, 
which coincides with the size of their clusters. In contrast, in the second period no author predominates because they 
have a similar number of publications. In the case of keywords, in the first period it is reflected that they focused on 
the use of frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban for agile project management; while, in the second period, they 
focus on software design. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Companies have undergone various changes in their organizations, and in response to this, agile methodologies can 
satisfy a wide range of software development projects and any other environment, where these small teams work in 
Sprint and self-organize, allowing them to learn topics and evolve the learning process, valuing collaborative work. 
Science and research in the IT sector are important for the development of a country, which is reflected in the 
technological progress of this industry in nations such as the United States and Brazil. This study will modify, identify 
and show the differences in scientific research on agile methodologies in IT project management before and after the 
pandemic in internationally recognized databases. It showed that the number of publications on this industry has been 
increasing and is expected to continue to do so in the coming years; however, there is no evidence of a large number 
of publications that are related to Covid-19. It must be taken into account that it is important to fully comply with the 
learning principle of these methodologies in order to adequately achieve autonomous management in agile projects.

Abstract   
Understanding the reasons why smallholder farmers do not use financial instruments to protect themselves against 
losses brought on by climate change concerns is currently a subject of rising relevance. Getting to the bottom of the 
underlying issues contributing to this status is important for future designs of financial innovations like a weather 
insurance index (WII) that can help farmers hedge their losses. Therefore, this study considered testing the 5 
technology characteristics that Rodgers identified for uptake to take place. These include trialability, complexity, 
compatibility, relative advantage, and observability, covering a period from 2014 to 2020. The study used  a concurrent 
mixed-methods approach to ensure both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the study were considered, given the 
complexity of the inquiry. The study used purposive sampling to select 4 districts in Zambia: Choma, Petauke, 
Chongwe, and Mumbwa using the standard sample size table provided by Sekeran (2003), which provided for a sample 
size of 1024 at a concentration of 0.035 with an accuracy level of 95% confidence. The farmers were interviewed 
using structured questionnaires. An IBM statistical analysis in social science (SPSS) was used to analyze quantitative 
data, and thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data.  From the study 50.82% of the farmer’s said WII is 
not consistent with the p-value of 0.001, which was significant, and further, 40.8% of the farmers indicated the 
importance of bundling the services to have relative advantages of the product with a p-value of 0.001. 47.87% of 
farmers indicated they were not satisfied with the payout system, with a p-value of 0.001, which was significant. The 
study concluded that paying attention to the innovation characteristics as suggested by the diffusion innovation theory 
by Rodgers is important and that the theory can extend its views by considering the functionality of the market. 
Farmers do not adopt innovations at the same time, which has practical ramifications for the study’s findings.

Abstract 
This study describes a journey study regarding parents using various types of tools to help walk especially canes that 
last in the range of 50 years time. A systematic study was conducted with an interesting document study from Scopus 
to see the dynamics and trends of ongoing research take place. Withdrawal document conducted with method enter 
keywords related to canes, elderly, assistive technology. Study data through graphics describe trend-growing research 
from 1973 to 2022. Based on the amount of published journal in the period time between 1973 and 2022 shows Journal 
of Aging and Mental Health occupy the position top in amount issue then followed by the journal International 
Psychogeriatrics and the journal Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. In contrast, a big amount of 
citations obtained shows the Journal Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation's most popular study followed 
by the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society and the British Journal of Psychiatry. Research studies in this area 
show a trend increase from 1973 to 2022 where in 2015 it reached the amount publications highest while in 2016 to 
2021 experienced a little decline.  Based on the study results study in a period time for 50 years could estimate the 
gap research that can take to get novelty research in a set plan study in the future.

1. Introduction
United Nations (2019) predicts that in 2060 it will happen enhancement the world population of advanced people age 
where are people with age more than 60 years old by 23.0% and 80.7% of the condition demographic will live in an 
income country low and medium. Besides some countries experience a spike in growth population aged old like Japan 
where growth is estimated to exceed all other countries. This showed that in a country Japan has proportion highest 
inhabitant carry-on age where more than 20% of people aged over 65 years ( Elokla & Hirai 2015). The aging 
demographic presenting challenge to policy mainly in developed and developing countries that have major health 
policies and programs. The global increase in the number of adults more old has contributed to the increasing 
prevalence of inability activity life daily activities ( activities of daily living, ADL), generally defined as experiencing 
difficulty in Duty care self like sleep, eating, bathing, and dressing. Seniors with ADL defects are at risk of losing 
their ability to live independently in society, resulting in enhancement Requests for service health, use House decrepit, 
and use tool help mobility and support care long term (Fong, 2021). The mobility of people is very important for 
increasing the quality of life for humans. With mobility, man could do activities productive and valuable for self alone 
as well as in Public surroundings. With walking time mobility somebody could be disturbed with increased age, 
pathology disease, factor genetics, susceptibility, disorders physiological and sensory, and barriers environment 
another impact on increasing risk drop mobility ( Elokla and Hirai 2015). Understanding how mobility decline is very 
important for finding methods for promoting mobility at age-old (Merja.et.al. 2010).  
Parents' ability to experience drop with increasing age that can cause a happening accident like fall is increasing 
problem in the world, which leads to various types of non-fatal and fatal injuries or even death. According to the CDC, 
the population of elderly has increased decade last, and a third of people aged 65 years experience incident falls every 
year (Tsai, et.al. 2014). Reason falls on parents influenced by factors intrinsic and extrinsic to self elderly that. Intrinsic 
factor is originating factor from self somebody whereas factor extrinsic is factors caused by the environment.

Abstract 
Assignment Problem corresponds with the product distribution between demand points and supply points. Many 
algorithms were suggested to find the optimal result. The purpose of this study is to propose an appropriate model to 
explore the solution to the assignment problem. This paper focuses on Hungarian Method. This study has conducted 
a detailed case study to find a feasible solution to the assignment problem. The computational outcomes suggested 
that Hungarian Method provides an optimal solution and can handle any complex scenario. The findings of this study 
can be used as a reference for decision-makers to mitigate production-related risk and adapted to sustainable market 
changes.

1. Introduction
In today's world, where critical upgrades in the assignment of items from various sources to various destinations are 
required, the assignment of an appropriate vehicle has become a focus for organizations. (Xiang et al. 2021). Drivers 
waste an average of approximately 107 hours in a year due to huge traffic on the road and pay around $2243 per year 
for not assigning vehicles to the appropriate parking place (Woodyard 2018). Drivers' failure to estimate the right 
assignment of vehicles which costs more than $20 billion or $97 per driver in a year only in the USA (McCoy 2017). 
A review which is funded by the World Bank, assessed a yearly financial expense of a queue of cars of around 47 billion 
LE (8 billion USD) in the ""Greater Cairo Region” in 2010, bringing about a per capita cost of about 2400 LE (400 
USD). Such expense is assessed to be approximately 15% of the total per capita GDP (Nakat, Herrera, and Cherkaoui 
2013).  
Furthermore, a bottleneck is a congested area in a manufacturing system (such as an assembly line or a computer 
network) that causes the system to stop or move very slowly. Inefficiencies in the bottleneck frequently result in delays 
and higher production costs. Bottlenecks can disrupt the flow of the manufacturing process and significantly increase 
the time and cost of production. Bottlenecks are more likely to occur when a company begins the production process 
for a new product. This is due to the possibility of process issues that the company must identify and resolve; this 
condition necessitates additional examination and fine-tuning. Controlling the production process, anticipating potential 
bottlenecks, and devising effective solutions should be the primary concern of any company. One of the most common 
causes of bottlenecks is the failure to assign the appropriate machine to the appropriate location. This consequence 
signifies assignment problems that create an obstacle to provide many commodities in the right place on time. To put

Figure 2 illustrates the visual representation of the solution to the unbalanced assignment problem. 
 
6. Conclusion Future Recommendations 
Both balanced and unbalanced problems for allocating a task to a particular machine are taken into consideration in 
this study. To determine whether the approach is more feasible, the total cost for assigning those jobs is computed in 
both cases. Five jobs are divided among five separate machines in the balanced assignment problem. It was simple to 
allocate five jobs to five distinct machines because the number of machines and jobs are equal. However, because 
there are more jobs than machines in the unbalanced problem, a dummy row for the machine is inserted, and its cost 
is zero. By using the Hungarian Method, it can be demonstrated that the one task for the unbalanced problem that is 
given to machine 5 has no cost. Because of this, the overall cost of the unbalanced problem is lower, whereas the cost 
of the balanced problem is higher. Additionally, it can be seen that Jobs 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to the same machines, 
namely Machines 1, 3, and 4, for both the balanced and unbalanced methods. Job-4 and Job-5, however, have different 
machines assigned for both techniques due to that false row The second procedure is regarded as being more practical 
than the first since the total cost in the unbalanced problem is 27, which is significantly lower than the total cost in the 
balanced problem. However, because machine-5 is hypothetical, it has no associated costs; as a result, the overall cost 
is lower. In addition, job 5 cannot be assigned to a hypothetical machine; it requires a real machine. The Hungarian 
Method is therefore inaccurate for problems involving unbalance. However, a balanced problem is doable. A different 
approach, not the Hungarian Method as shown by the solved problem, can be used to discover the best solution to an 
unbalanced problem where the extra task can be sent to a real machine.

Abstract 
This paper identifies the necessity of a Cyber-Physical Production System development for the Make-to-Order 
industry. The uniqueness of the Make-to-Order industry is that orders are low in production volume but wide in 
product variety. Thus, accurate and real-time data acquisition of the production activity is necessary to support 
decision-making to respond to customer orders and monitor production activities. The proposed Cyber-Physical 
Production System utilizes RFID and current sensors to identify the parts and machine activities. The Cyber-Physical 
Production System is proven cost-effective to the alternative controller-based Cyber-Physical Production System. 
Initial implementation has proven a viable solution and provides benefits to support decision-making in the Make-to-
Order industry.

1. Introduction
One of the manufacturing strategies to respond to customer requirements is make-to-order (MTO). The MTO industry 
has the production capacity to create a product based on the specifications desired by customers. The key to responding 
to customers lies in the production capabilities in manufacturing the order specification and the ability to track the 
production progress. Therefore, records of production activities are essential due to the wide variety of products with 
low production volumes. The recording of production activities in the MTO industry needs to be carried out on every 
order and at every production facility. It differs from the mass production industry, in which production activities can 
be monitored at the last stage of the production process or at a bottleneck machine. 
This research focuses on the MTO industry, which produces various discrete products. The machines used in 
manufacturing the products consist of multiple CNC machines and conventional machines having various 
manufacturing processes such as milling, turning, drilling, grinding, etc. Production activities are generally recorded 
in the form of a logbook. The logbook contains entries of operator activities in processing customer orders following 
the process plan (machine sequence) for each order. The operator will regularly update the production status in the 
logbook. The profiling of the logbook data is then used for monitoring and evaluating the production activities by 
connecting the logbook to a production planning system, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP). The ERP system 
is the basis of information used in decision-making to increase capability, adaptability, and awareness in production 
activities (Urbina Coronado, 2018). 
Based on a survey of several MTO industries, logbook filling is performed manually through operator entry or barcode 
scan. This is in line with the findings of Seegar (2022), who stated that there are numerous missing links between 
physical systems (machinery and equipment) and production decision-making systems. This manual process presents 
various drawbacks, namely inaccuracies in production data and additional administrative burdens to operators. On the 
other hand, production activity logbooks are a source of increased responsiveness to customers and productivity 
(Mudgal et al., 2020). The development of production logbooks in the MTO industry has the potential to utilize 
Industry 4.0 technology. One of the pillar technologies of Industry 4.0 is the Cyber-Physical Production System 
(CPPS). CPPS allows various production objects to be interconnected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In the 
case of the MTO industry, there are two critical production objects: customer order and machine for processing the

Figure 7. Logbook vs. CPPS recording for setup time 
 
Aside from the data acquisition, it has been identified by MTO practitioners that the productivity data of the operator 
and machine gives precise feedback to the MTO management in evaluating the cost structure of each customer order. 
Cost evaluation before CPPS implementation is conducted in an aggregate manner where operator and machine costs 
are distributed roughly among orders being processed at a particular planning horizon. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study has developed a cost-effective CPPS implemented for the MTO industry. The data acquired by the CPPS 
include part/order and machine activities on a real-time basis. The CPPS development was carried out through three 
steps: reviewing the as-is system, defining the to-be system, and identifying the gap analysis of the CPPS requirements. 
Initial implementation in the MTO industry proves that the proposed CPPS could monitor the production progress of 
customer orders and machining utilization, including setup and cutting time. The data acquisition also provides other 
potential decision support, such as direct cost evaluation (operator and machine) of each customer order. Future 
research and development will focus on utilizing learning algorithms to ensure that the response process of data 
collected by the CPPS can be executed intelligently and autonomously.

Abstract 
Currently, retail businesses must be as competitive as possible, and for this, their logistics system must be efficient 
and optimal; however, it is known that these have various problems such as longer delivery times, product delivery 
errors, offering a quality of service that meets customer expectations, etc. To solve these problems, the implementation 
of Lean Six Sigma tools was proposed, and a systematic review of the literature was carried out to determine which 
Lean Six Sigma tool is the most frequent and expose the benefits provided to the logistics system of retail businesses. 
A combination of keywords was used in prestigious databases such as Web of Science, Scopus and Pro-Quest to 
search for academic articles. On the other hand, for the analysis and classification of each article, categories and 
subcategories were used for synthesizing the information from each research work. To determine which tool is the 
most frequent, the number of articles were quantified if they applied an LSS tool and met the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. Regarding the results, after carrying out the systematic review of the literature, the DMAIC tool was the most 
frequent and provided benefits such as a reduction in the number of complaints, a reduction in lead time, operations 
costs reduction, among others.

1. Introduction
Digitalization and globalization have caused retail businesses to evolve due to the strong competition caused by new 
trends (Olsson et al. 2019). This is why, by opting for the online channel, the inherent difficulties with existing 
logistical issues are intensifying (Campbell and Fransi 2021).  
The logistical problems of the online channel are mainly related to longer delivery times, product delivery errors, 
among others (Zhang et al. 2016). On the other hand, companies are constantly struggling to obtain a balance between 
service quality, cost of meeting expectations, customer deadlines, and reducing costs (Chen et al. 2013). 
 It is known that online purchase intention increases as companies offer faster delivery, reliable logistics carriers and 
high fulfillment rates (Riley and Klein 2019); therefore, retail businesses had to consolidate online sales, a sales 
modality that was on the rise but was not within the company's focus. It is necessary to highlight that consumers 
consider as a priority a rate adequate to the quality of service, then the delivery times and finally whether on the 
stipulated date, the delivery will be day or night (Nguyen et al. 2019). 
The problems described above can be addressed by the Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology, offering several tools 
with the appropriate functionality to try to solve the various drawbacks in the logistics system of retail businesses.   
1.1 Objectives 
The objectives of this investigation are to determine by a systematic review, which Lean Six Sigma tool is the most 
frequent and to expose the benefits provided to the logistics system of retail businesses, collected from each article 
analyzed.

Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022

In addition, 31% of the articles analyzed where LSS tools were implemented in the internal logistics of retail, were 
supermarkets. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on our research objectives, it can be concluded that the LSS tool mostly used to try to solve the problems within 
the logistics system of retail businesses is DMAIC.  
 
With the application of this tool in the logistics system, it was possible to obtain a 30% reduction in the number of 
complaints (Nabhani and Shokri 2009), a 33% increase in complete deliveries, a 33% reduction in lead time, and 
finally, a reduction in annual operating costs of $600,000. 
 
It is important to mention that 86.7% of the academic articles studied in the systematic review applied their case 
studies in large companies in North America, Asia and Europe, which is why, when trying to apply the LSS tools 
addressed in this research in small companies, the results or indicators may not be as expected.  
 
It is worth noting that not many researches were found that applied the VSM or Kaizen tools, the latter has only 3 
appearances, which is the least found in the systematic review of the 28 academic articles. Both tools should be 
considered in future research to discover the benefits they could bring to retail logistics systems. 
 
Finally, the main contribution of this research is that the application of the LSS methodology was mostly applied to 
the industrial sector. So our research demonstrated an original approach in the implementation of LSS to the retail 
sector in order to expose the benefits that this tools can provide.

Abstract 
The increasing number of restaurants in Indonesia requires more careful monitoring of food safety. Consumer 
perception of food hygiene is useful for assessing restaurant food safety practices. The purpose of this study is to 
investigate customer satisfaction in Restaurant X using a food hygiene perspective. Instruments involving three factors 
i.e., food quality, food service, and environment and facility were developed. The study was done at 3 franchised
restaurants in Surakarta involving 395 respondents. Further, the importance-performance analysis (IPA) was utilized
to analyze the data. In addition, as the customers’ demographics, such as gender and age may influence satisfaction,
therefore these factors were also evaluated. The result shows that overall, 5 attributes that relate to restaurant facilities
and environment, e.g., attribute number 16 (clean and well-maintained kitchen), 17 (clean and well-maintained service
area), 21 (clean and tidy garbage disposal area), 22 (clean dining table and the cloth used to clean the table), and 25
(clean and well-maintained toilet), need to be improved. The result also reveals that compared to the male customers
the female perceived that more attributes need to be improved. Meanwhile, in groups based on age, customers above
twenty require more attributes that need improvement compared to the others.

1. Introduction
The growth of restaurants can be caused by a variety of factors, including practical lifestyles, technological 
advancements that have led to a variety of meal delivery services, and eating out habits. The competitiveness in this 
industry has also increased due to the huge development in the number of restaurants. Customer satisfaction is a key 
success factor in the foodservice industry (Saad et al. 2006, Andaleeb and Caskey 2007). The key to business 
sustainability is having repeat orders from customers (customers being loyal to our products). As satisfaction could 
lead to loyalty (Szymanski and  Henard, 2001, Fornell et al. 1996), hence it is crucial to identify the factors that 
contribute to consumer satisfaction. 
Given the significant number of cases of foodborne illness in Indonesia, food hygiene is a crucial concern in the 
restaurant business. In 2019, there were 6205 cases of foodborne illness in Indonesia, according to the National

attributes need improvement. Without differentiate the customers based on their demography profile, the IPA diagram 
shows that restaurant need to improve 6 attributes, number 16, 17, 21, 22 and 25 since all customer expect much on 
those attributes but their performance below the expectation.  
 
4. Conclusion  
An investigation to customer satisfaction on food quality, service quality and environment facility of a restaurant has 
been done. The result shows that there is a quite different perception on which attributes that need to be improved 
based on customer groups. However, all groups agreed that kitchen and service area cleanliness need improvement. 
This study evaluates the customer satisfaction based on demographic profiles. Since customers that have different 
level of hygiene knowledge may have different perception on restaurant food safety practices, hence forthcoming 
studies evaluating this factor maybe beneficial.

Abstract 
In recent years, the fashion industry has experienced high-intensity changes that require innovation activities to 
support operational performance. Although there have been many studies on operational performance, studies on 
operational performance involving small businesses, especially in the fashion industry in developing countries, are 
very limited. This study aims to examine the role of knowledge management and product innovation in improving the 
performance of MSMEs in the fashion industry. Through a hierarchical regression analysis involving 100 MSMEs in 
Yogyakarta, Indonesia, this study finds that knowledge management and product innovation positively affect MSMEs' 
performance. In addition, this study also finds the role of product innovation in mediating the effect of knowledge 
management on the performance of MSMEs. In general, this study has two contributions. First, in light of the scant 
literature relating product innovation to the connection between knowledge management and performance, 
theoretically, this study investigates how product innovation mediates the relationship between these two variables. 
Second, this study provides empirical evidence that can be used to develop policies, to encourage the increased 
operational performance of MSMEs in the fashion industry, through the implementation of knowledge management 
and product innovation. 
Keywords 
Operational Performance, Knowledge Management, Product Innovation, MSMEs, and Fashion Industry. 
1. Introduction
Over the last few years, the changing business environment has impacted all industries, including fashion. In the 
fashion industry, change challenges include changes in customer tastes that are getting faster and product life cycles 
getting shorter. Gonzales and Chacon (2014) argue that the product life cycle in the fashion industry is concise, so 
businesses in this industry are required to understand changing customer preferences in developing new products. 
Consequently, businesses in such industry characteristics are necessary to utilize knowledge-based resources to 
improve operational performance and support competitiveness. In this context, Dahiyat (2015) argues that knowledge 
management (KM) and innovation are critical strategic factors in improving organizational performance when facing 
business environment changes.  
In Yogyakarta, Indonesia, the fashion industry is one of the fastest growing industries, especially Batik clothing (a 
typical Indonesian cloth that has been designated as a cultural heritage by UNESCO) which has become an icon for 
souvenirs typical of Yogyakarta. Fashion has become the backbone of the creative economy industrial sector in 
Indonesia. According to the Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy, the contribution of the fashion industry is 
nearly 20 percent of all creative economy industry sectors in Indonesia (Ananda 2021), with a gross regional domestic 
product (GRDP) value of IDR 180.22 trillion in 2021 (Kusnandar 2022). Unfortunately, as the backbone of the creative 
economy, the fashion industry in Indonesia cannot escape from the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, 
especially the fashion industry in the MSMEs sector (Ananda, 2021), as a result of changes in people's consumption 
patterns during the pandemic (Kusnandar 2022). The decline of the fashion industry in Indonesia can be seen in the 
negative growth of GRDP in the apparel and textile industry, which has continued to fall for two consecutive years, 
namely -8.88% in 2020 and -4.08% in 2021 (Kusnandar 2022).

this study proves that product innovation partially mediates the effect of KM on operational performance, so H4 is 
accepted. 
5.2 Discussion 
The positive influence of KM on product innovation in MSMEs in the fashion industry means that product innovation 
is the result of KM practices within the organization. These results confirm previous studies' findings that KM is an 
antecedent for innovation (Dahiyat 2015). This is possible given the ability of KM to develop and utilize new ideas as 
significant intellectual capital for product innovation (Huang and Li 2009). Organizations gain opportunities to 
increase innovation through new knowledge gained from KM practices (Dahiyat and Al-Zu'bi 2012). In addition, 
through KM practices, organizations obtain benefits related to improving employee creativity, encouraging the 
emergence of creative ideas, and increasing product innovation (Darroch 2005). These results are consistent with 
earlier studies, which found that KM positively influences product innovation (Bas et al. 2015; Al-Sa'di et al. 2017; 
Lee et al. 2013). 
The ability of product innovation to influence operational performance also means that apart from KM, product 
innovation is also an important predictor of the operational performance of MSMEs in the fashion industry. This 
means that the organization can achieve superior operational performance through the concentration of resource 
utilization in product innovation activities. Tan et al. (2007). Therefore, an innovative organizational environment 
could support the mission of organizational growth and productivity (Cainelli et al. 2004). Through its ability to 
respond to change effectively, product innovation can provide benefits to the organization (Evangelista and Vezzani 
2010; Lloréns-Montes et al. 2004). This result is aligned with the study of Al-Sa'di et al. (2017), who found that 
product innovation affects operational performance. 
Furthermore, product innovation is also proven to mediate the influence of KM on the operational performance of 
MSMEs in the fashion industry. This result means that product innovation can better explain KM's influence on 
operational performance. These results explain that KM practices enable companies to innovate, which improves 
organizational, and operational performance (Schiuma and Carlucci 2008). Statistical results in this study indicate that 
product innovation partially mediates the effect of KM on operational performance. This result means that apart from 
a direct effect, KM also indirectly impacts operational performance. In addition, these results also explain that effective 
KM practices can affect operational performance indirectly through product innovation (Inkinen et al. 2015). 
6. Conclusion
Although previous research on KM, product innovation, and operational performance has been conducted, there are 
still some research gaps, as explained in the introduction. Research proves theoretically that KM and product 
innovation are essential predictors in improving operational performance in the fashion industry in Indonesia. In 
addition, this study also demonstrates that product innovation has a vital role in explaining the effect of KM on 
operational performance through a partial mediation effect. Empirically, this study provides empirical evidence that 
owners and managers can utilize in developing policies to encourage the increased operational performance of MSMEs 
in the fashion industry through implementing knowledge management and product innovation. 
Based on the results of this study, owners and managers of MSMEs need to develop KM practices and product 
innovation to be able to respond to the rapid changes that occur in the fashion industry, related to the shortening of 
product life cycles due to changes in customer tastes and trends in this industry. Consequently, MSMEs need to invest 
in things that can improve KM practices and product innovation to respond to market changes with adjustments 
required by customers. 
Although the objectives of this study have been met, the study has several limitations. First, the number of respondents 
in this study is relatively small (100 respondents). Second, this research only focuses on MSMEs in the fashion 
industry in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. These two things are certainly an issue in the generalization of the results of this 
study. For this reason, it is necessary to execute similar studies conducted in other areas in developing countries with 
a more significant number of samples to strengthen the generalizability of this study’s findings in the future. In 
addition, this research only focuses on the fashion industry, so it is essential to conduct similar research in other 
industries to strengthen the theory and simultaneously give a thorough analysis of the impact of KM and product 
innovation on MSMEs' operational performance.

Abstract 
This study investigates the role of supply chain agility in mediating the relationship between knowledge sharing, 
innovation capability, and absorptive capacity for competitive advantage. This research used structural equation 
modeling (SEM) methods to analyze the data. This study employs SmartPLS for data processing. Data were collected 
by distributing the questionnaire to respondents who met the requirements that the researcher had determined. The 
samples in this study were 200 coffee shops with more than 500 Instagram followers, while the research respondents 
were owners, managers, and supervisors who managed the coffee shop. The findings revealed that absorptive ability 
significantly and favorably impacted supply chain agility and competitive advantage. Supply chain agility had a 
positive and significant impact on competitive advantage. Absorptive capacity and competitive advantage were 
mediated by supply chain agility in a positive and significant way. On the other hand, there is no effect of knowledge 
sharing on competitive advantage or supply chain agility. Supply chain agility cannot mediate the relationship between 
knowledge sharing and competitive advantage. Likewise, innovation capability does not affect competitive advantage, 
and supply chain agility and supply chain agility cannot mediate the relationship between innovation capability and 
competitive advantage.

1. Introduction
To survive, advance, and triumph over the competition, businesses require a competitive advantage. Businesses 
currently compete as part of a supply chain network rather than as individual entities in the highly competitive business 
market. The organization and its supply chain network must constantly increase its capacity to react swiftly to market 
changes and update information and technology that are continuously evolving as a result of internal R&D and outside 
knowledge. Knowledge sharing (K.S.), absorptive capacity (A.C.), innovation capability (I.C.), and supply chain 
agility (SCA) are four key sources that are important for a company's competitive advantage. (Eidizadeh, 2017; 
Arsawan et al., 2020; Than et al., 2019; Lo & Tian, 2020; Ambe, 2010, MacCarthy et al., 2016, Martinez-Sanchez & 
Lahoz-Leo, 2018).  
Knowledge Sharing can help companies to produce knowledge resources obtained through collaboration and creation 
that make problem-solving skills so that the results expected by the company can be achieved. In achieving success 
for competitive advantage, problem-solving skills must be possessed so that each element is aware of the decision-
making process (Azeem et al., 2021). For companies to be more agile, companies need to share knowledge and 
information in the market in the supply chain process. Knowledge sharing is required to implement supply chain 
agility to make coordination more effective (Tuan, 2016).

market, and integrate between networks/suppliers. Companies must also be more responsive to increasing customer 
demand for innovative products.

Abstract 
The document presents the results of the evaluation of the milk sample classification process through the modeling of 
machine learning techniques, with random forest being the most accurate according to its accuracy percentage of 
96%. The paper presents the results of the evaluation of the milk sample classification process through the modeling 
of machine learning techniques. This research aimed to discriminate the presence or absence of adulterants, which 
allows the obtaining of dairy products suitable for human consumption. Also, accelerate and specify the inspection 
process of these samples. The relevance of the present study can be understood from the product under analysis: 
milk. This is mass consumption, especially in children. Therefore, it is considered relevant to demonstrate efficiently 
that quality products are provided to the population and this document is a contribution to the credibility of the integrity 
of dairy products.

1. Introduction
The safety of milk is relevant for the mass production of dairy suitable for human consumption, due to the close 
relationship between raw milk and its derivatives such as cheese, yogurt, evaporated milk, among others. Milk has 
been recommended by organizations, such as UNESCO and FAO, as an indispensable food sustenance, especially for 
infants. Therefore, its production and distribution represents a significant part of food security strategies in various 
countries (Fuentes et al., 2013). To achieve the right standards, good hygiene practices must be implemented during 
production and storage. According to Pathot (2019), in his study on hygienic practices and bacteriological quality of 
milk, the establishment of standards, the use of effective application, the education of dairy staff and producers on 
various aspects of milk hygiene and handling technique are relevant. Milk is part of a remarkable base for the 
reproduction of microorganisms because of its high nutritional percentage; Because of this, the health of this must be 
constantly evaluated. Raw milk in its optimum condition must not have residues or sediments, be tasteless or have 
unusual color and odor; in addition, a minimum content of bacteria, the absence of chemical substances and normal 
acidity indices in its composition. Distinguishing the integrity of dairy will promote the implementation of standards, 
which ensure healthy products (Gonzales et al., 2019). The present research seeks to classify milk samples, according 
to the presence or absence of adulterants, which allow the obtaining of dairy products suitable for human 
consumption. The 
traditional 
method 
of 
identifying 
properties 
of 
this 
product 
is 
given 
through 
experimentation; however, classification methods and techniques linked to the use of machine learning show better 
results than traditional methods; In addition, they are very useful, at present, for society, since they are transforming 
industrial processes, which bring with them improvements in terms of efficient productive operations and agile 
decision making. In addition, it allows the collection of data, prediction of events based on these, creation of value-
added models through the use of automation techniques, accelerate and specify the process of sample inspection.

Figure 6. Comparison of accuracy percentages 
 
In instance, it is claimed that the random forest technique provides a more accurate model, because its value is the 
highest in terms of accuracy and prediction of data. Likewise, it is visualized that with respect to KNN there is no 
wide variation in terms of what is mentioned; However, neural networks show reduced values and present different 
values in each execution of the model due to the random choice of data from the beginning. 
 
5.3 Proposal Improvements  
With the results collected, it was decided to implement the improvement proposal within the random forest 
technique. The method of reducing variables was used with the random tree sampling technique. For this, the boruta 
library from the dataset of Neto et al. (2019) was used. It went from a total of 531 estimators to 112, in order to have 
significant information for the final result of the model. This applied to a real scenario is responsible for minimizing 
costs and times during the analysis of samples. 
 
5.4 Validation  
After data training, random forest was applied to the 112 estimators, which had been selected and an accuracy of 0.99 
was achieved. Although the improvement was 1%, it is shown that borura contributes to the accuracy of input data 
minimizing those anomalous data that enter the model. 
 
In order to specify the selected techniques and the appropriate machine learning models for the analysis of milk 
samples, tests were carried out that compared the performance of the methods described in the methodology. Starting 
with the random trees they managed to obtain between 94% to 99% accuracy working with 2/3 of the randomly 
established data. For KNN working in the same way with the records, a level of accuracy between 77% and 81% was 
achieved. Finally, for neural networks it was not possible to ensure a certain level of accuracy, since the input data 
being random so that the values that the neural networks threw are very volatile. As much as all the methods proved 
to have acceptable performances, what inclines us to choose one of them is the nature of their way of operating, we 
are talking about the randomness trees that their branched structure effectively serves to classify the different classes 
of adulterants (ingredients) within the samples and after this selection we begin to train the dataset within this method 
to impact aspects such as time or correlativity within trees. It is worth mentioning that in the multiclass section we are 
talking about: peroxide, sucrose, formaldehyde, raw, bicarbonate, starch and within the binary class if it is raw milk 
or not raw milk. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In the present work, we submitted milk samples with adulterants and their respective spectral data in search of ways 
to predict and classify according to the interest of the research. A total of 969 milk registers were used with different 
adulterant ingredients which were used within classifying models such as KNN, random trees and neural networks all 
with the ability to recognize the elements of the composition within the milk. 
 
After testing the models on different occasions in order to achieve a consistent and effective one, we achieved 
satisfactory results in both random trees and KNN. Due to its nature of procedure and structure, random forest allows

a better classification of milk components accurately between 96% and 99% after training the data to discard non-
significant data and make the development of the model more accurate, so randomness trees end up being the ideal 
way to operate to work with data related to laboratory samples and compositional analysis. Finally, we consider 
expanding this work with more development within the field of neural networks, as they are a preferable tool when 
predicting the behavior or nature that milk samples may present and thus make more profitable what is covered in this 
project.

Abstract 
The problems related to COVID-19 have not been completely overcome in several counties and transmission is still 
happening. The COVID-19 virus, which can survive for several hours or even days on the surface of objects, can 
increase the risk of transmitting the virus if the virus is attached to various surfaces of goods. During the pandemic, 
many people turn to online purchases where packages will be delivered by online courier services. In a pandemic 
condition like this, logistics companies are no longer only required to be able to deliver packages on time but are also 
expected to ensure that the delivered packages do not become one of the transmission media for the COVID-19 virus 
or other viruses/bacteria. Based on these problems, this study aims to design a sterilizer box to sterilize goods, 
especially food packages that can be carried by couriers so that packages can be sterilized during the delivery process 
and are safe for health when received by the recipient of the package. The results of this study provide ideas and initial 
design concepts of a food delivery service sterilizer box which can later be developed further until it can be 
commercialized.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all countries in the world. Indonesia is one of the countries that has a high 
number of COVID-19 cases compared to other countries. Transmission of the COVID-19 virus can come from various 
media such as droplets (drops of saliva) when someone coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes, and small particles that 
float in the air. One of the media that can transmit this virus is the surface of a contaminated object. A person can 
catch the COVID-19 virus when they touch his nose, mouth, or eyes after touching a surface that may have been 
contaminated with the virus from a person who coughs or sneezes without washing hands or using an antiseptic. 
Due to the pandemic, people tend to make purchases online. According to Anteraja Suyanto Tjoeng, CEO of PT Tri 
Adi Bersama (Lokadata.id, 2021) said that the volume of goods shipments rose by 20 percent, with the average daily 
volume reaching 135 thousand since the COVID-19 pandemic entered Indonesia. This is due to a surge in buying and 
selling transactions in e-commerce which is triggered by the fear and concern of the public being infected with the 
virus when they have to shop outside the home. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people often shop for daily 
necessities through digital platforms, ordering food online is the most people's expenditure during a pandemic. This 
is in line with the results of research conducted by the Demographic Institute of the Faculty of Economics and 
Business, University of Indonesia (LD FEB UI) which conducted a survey of 4,199 active users of Grab or Gojek 
services. From the survey results, it was found that 97% of digital spending during the COVID-19 pandemic was for 
ordering food online followed by online at 76%. 
Motorcycle couriers are one of the most effective alternatives for delivery of food and beverages door-to-door. 
Motorcycle couriers are considered efficient because they can more easily get through traffic jams on the highway. 
Regarding food delivery, online couriers often use delivery boxes. The use of boxes for food couriers is indeed 
considered better because it keeps food from being damaged and avoids the influence of environmental conditions 
such as heat and rain. However, couriers still have some problems related to boxes used, such as the size of the box 
that cannot be adjusted to the size of the item, easy to carry, safety etc. In terms of online store customers, in the midst 
of the current COVID-9 pandemic, the need for goods or food delivery facilities that can reduce the risk of virus 
transmission has increased. Currently, there is no delivery box for goods or food equipped with facilities for the 
prevention or reduction of viruses or bacteria (sterilizer). Therefore, we need a means of carrying goods or storage 
that can meet the needs of shipping couriers while meeting customer needs in terms of maintaining the quality and 
hygiene of the goods or food delivered. 
Based on the description of the background, the problems that become the focus of this research are as follows:

Concept is a picture of technology, working principles, and product form. Meanwhile, concept selection is the 
process of evaluating the concept with respect to consumer needs and other criteria, comparing the strengths and 
weaknesses of a concept, and selecting one or more concepts for further development. (Ulrich, 2011). In the 
development and selection of concepts, several stages were carried out, namely morphology chart, alternative 
concept, concept screening, and concept scoring. 
Step 1: Morphology Chart: A morphology chart is a list or summary of a systematic analysis of changes in shape to 
assist product designers in identifying new combinations of product elements or components. 
Step 2: Concept Alternative: Concept screening is compiled based on a matrix of alternative concept results and is 
assessed using selection criteria determined based on Demanded Quality. There are three codes where + for ""better 
than,"" 0 for ""same as,"" - for ""worse than"" compared to existing products on the market. In the alternative concept, 
there are 5 alternative concepts that can be used for further product development. From 5 alternatives, three concepts 
chosen for scoring are concepts 2, 3, and 4 because they have a net score and are not negative. 
Step 3: Concept Scoring: Concept Scoring is conducted based on selection criteria based on Demanded Quality. 
weight used is derived from the calculation of demanded quality on the HOQ.

4. Conclusions 
From the results of a series of design stages, this study proposes a sterilizer box design that has several innovations 
that distinguish it from boxes currently on the market, including: The proposed box offers sterilizer mechanism 
which use UVC light which is proven to be effective in killing viruses and bacteria. Sterilization also takes place 
automatically using a magnetic switch sensor. Second, it is expandable box. Third, it is easy to assembly. The 
proposed material of the box made from canvas that is not too rigid will be easier to adjust. In addition, with the 
addition of a frame and box, it will make the box easier to install on the motorbike stably. Therefore, the combination 
of canvas, base box and frame will make the box easy to disassemble and install. It is also proposed to be an 
Ergonomic design. Boxes generally use canvas without a frame so it is comfortable to use even though it is not strong 
enough. On OXEN, there are attachments such as frames on the sides of the box to keep it strong when placed on 
the vehicle. In addition, attachment that is adjusted to the shape of the back will make the rider more comfortable or 
if when the courier takes the service between passengers, the passenger will feel comfortable even though the box is 
still installed on the vehicle. Next, is portable (using wheels and carrying luggage). At OXEN, the added features of 
wheels and luggage carriers that can be adjusted in length to make it easier for couriers to pick up food at a shop that 
is quite far from the motorbike parking lot, food delivered in large quantities, or the customer's house is far from the 
motorbike parking lot like in an apartment.

Abstract 
Nowadays, the challenges that covid-19 has generated to the financial community that operates within the stock market 
has generated a greater uncertainty in the profitability and consequently has made this practice more difficult. To 
overcome that problem the present study aims to develop a model that facilitates this work; this model uses the SVR 
regression algorithm and through technical indicators provide us with the possible trend that the stock may take in the 
future and thus suggest that the investor in question buys, sells or holds the stock in view of that result. As a result of 
the project, it was proposed to use 7 technical indicators RSI, MACD, ROC, WMA, OBV, the Williams indicator and 
the stochastic oscillator that determine the current market condition. After validating the model, it was concluded that 
there are different Peruvian companies that have been able to overcome the difficulties of the pandemic with enough 
growth potential during this post-covid period.

1. Introduction
Nowadays it is a very popular practice to invest in company shares, but the uncertainty of these affects the profitability 
of the financial community and according to Akhtar et al. (2022), Machine Learning tools have been developed to 
reduce the risk. 
According to Demirel et al. (2021), future events depend, in part on current and past data but the financial time series 
is volatile, non-linear, non-parametric and unpredictable (pp.63-64). There is not much research on how stocks 
perform during a recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic; furthermore Albahli et al. (2022), proposes that there 
are many studies on predicting stock prices, but what an investor really seeks to know is the possible trend the stock 
will take in order to decide whether he should buy, sell or hold.  
This study has a significant importance since an optimal investment in stocks can contribute to the economic 
improvement of the country (Kumar et al., 2022). Our main research question: Is it feasible to predict stocks in

As we can see, accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity are the four metrics of the confusion matrix that denote 
the characteristics of the aforementioned Model1 and Model2 scores, the latter, as well as their metrics cannot have a 
value equal to 1, since it would represent an error, these values must be represented between 0 and 1 being values 
greater than 0.8 values of an optimal precision. 
 
6. Conclusion 
It can be concluded that in this research a price prediction experiment has been conducted using the support vector 
regression (SVR) model. Technical analysis and fundamental analysis indicators have been used. The data are 
evaluated by statistical indicators such as RSI, Williams, WMA, MACD and OBV. The model in turn is validated by 
the confusion matrix which seeks to evaluate the errors and successes of the model. Once the results are obtained, a 
visual evaluation is made, contrasting the information previously obtained with the results of the matrix and the values 
that do not pass the matrix will be discarded. 
Likewise, the technical indicators that denote greater precision are those that involve moments when the market is 
overbought and oversold, such as the RSI, MACD, ROC, WMA, OBV, the Williams indicator and the stochastic 
oscillator, Most of these need a large amount of historical data to be validated since there are technical indicators that 
use up to 26 periods, so using stocks with historical data of less than 2 years results in values equal to 1 in the confusion 
matrix metrics, which would denote an error in the model.

Abstract 
This study evaluated the potential to extract gold from e-waste mainly focusing on printed circuit boards (PCBs). E-
waste was first separated physically and then went through dissolution. Cyanide leaching and Aqua Regia leaching 
using various precipitating reagents such as zinc (Zn), aluminum (Al), Na2S2O5, FeSO4, NaBH4 on Zn and NaBH4 
on Al. The process was conducted at pH of 11.8 and 12.4. Gold extracted through cyanidation leaching with NaBH4 
on Zn precipitation resulted in gold extraction of 99.0% in comparison to leaching with Aqua Regia with NaBH4 on 
Zn precipitation to yield gold content of 91.9%. The e-waste processing plant was assumed to process 20000 tons 
per annum of PCBs with a gold yield of 1.4 tons and total power requirement of almost 203 000 KWhr. A total 
capital investment of USD 15 million was required with a payback period of 1.04 years and a return on investment 
of 0.96. E-waste can be utilized as a raw material to recover precious metals.

1. Introduction
An increase in the usage of electronic equipment has led to the generation of large quantities of electronic waste 
(e-waste) (Kang et al., 2005). E-waste includes radios, computers, cell phones, printers and calculators. E-waste is a 
growing waste source globally with a 3-5% increase annually (Park et al., 2017). E-waste contains different 
substances which are toxic, non-biodegradable and have negative impact on the environment and health resulting in 
diseases such as heart failures, cancer and kidney failures (Awasthi et al., 2018). E-waste also contains significant 
amounts of precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium as well as base metals such as copper and lead.

7. Conclusion
Gold can be recovered from e-waste as a value addition strategy. From this study, 38.9% was recovered from the 
electronic waste mainly composed of the PCBs. Physical separation and hydrometallurgical processing of the e-
waste using cyanidation and zinc precipitation resulted in a gold yield of 99.0 % at pH of 11.8 and 12.4. An 
economic evaluation of gold recovery for an e-waste input of 20 000 tons/year indicated capital investment 
requirements of USD 15 million. A return of investment of 0.96 was realized, with a payback period of 1.04 years 
and a breakeven of 33.9% of throughput capacity.

Abstract 
Automation lessens the amount of repetitive or boring labor that humans must do, which typically results in a better 
customer experience and lessened stress for your teams. It involves technology that transfers a function individuals 
perform to pieces of gear or software. A streamlined process with fewer or no manual stages is automation. 
Automation comes in two flavors: attended and unattended. Both may be combined in some automated processes. 
Automation has benefits that are frequently attributed, such as higher production rates and increased productivity. 
Less waste results from improved process control because materials are used more effectively. In comparison to human 
workers, automation systems often complete the production process with less variability. This translates to better 
safety and more control over the quality of the products. Safety of the workers is an important reason for automating 
industrial processes. It also helps in overall reduction in work hours of factory workers. Despite the advancements 
over the last ten years, businesses will need new automation technology to keep up with demand. Personalization at 
scale will be made possible by integrating human touch into an automated process and using cutting-edge technology 
like AI and machine learning.

1. Introduction
Fixed automation, commonly referred to as ""hard automation,"" describes an automated production facility where the 
equipment setup determines the order of processing processes. In reality, the machines' cams, gears, wires, and other 
hardware—hardware that cannot readily be switched from one product style to another—contain the programmed 
commands. Significant production rates and a high initial investment define this typing of automation. Therefore, it is 
appropriate for products that are produced in huge quantities. 
A type of automation for batch production is programmable automation. The goods are produced in batches of between 
a few dozen and a few thousand pieces. The production machinery must be reprogrammed and modified to 
accommodate the new product style for each new batch. Programmable automation can be called a subset of flexible 
automation. The time needed to reprogram and switch over the production equipment for each batch of new products 
is a drawback of programmable automation. This results in costly lost manufacturing time. The diversity of goods is 
sufficiently constrained in flexible automation so that equipment may be switched out fast and automatically. 
2.Literature Review
An undertaking has been made in the following paragraphs to bring out the challenges in automation across multiple 
industries and paths of life. 
2.1 Automation in Construction 
Computer technology has multiple applications in the construction industry and artificial intelligence is more 
commonly being used to address complex field problems. Having an automated system can provide continuous high 
accuracy results unlike fluctuations or errors that can be caused by humans. There will be an increase in productivity 
and any heavily laborious task can be performed with ease. Automation is perceived as the deciding factor for the 
market success of robotic systems, and is determined by the analysis of the costs and benefits associated with their 
development and field implementation. Automation and robotics bring about a complex environment to work in.

hiring turnaround times by giving employers online access to a huge pool of qualified applicants. It also lowers hiring 
expenses. Additionally, it promotes employee retention by increasing organizational transparency by enabling access 
to historical data on businesses and employees. 
 
The modern workplace is more disjointed than ever. Technologies that are disruptive have altered how people interact, 
collaborate, and work. Organizations will have to deal with a shortage of essential people, continuously changing skill 
requirements, and addressing the needs of various generations. On top of that, HR Today faces a significant difficulty 
in getting everyone on the same page and cooperating. The organization's biggest concern should be if the technology 
used can analyze organizational demands and business preparedness to ensure there is no gap between the services 
promised and those actually provided. Additionally, it is crucial that the firm choose whether to develop and manage 
technology internally or outside. The fear of losing their employment may prevent employees from adopting new 
working practices, making it difficult to persuade them to do so. As a result, encouraging employees to use new 
technologies is a major obstacle. The HR department of a commercial firm is more complex. There is a flood of 
information there. Finding the information, you need when you need it is a constant issue due to the variety of formats 
and media that employee information is available in. Organizations, particularly SMEs, should clearly state about the 
types of information that should be shared, who can access the data, and who will be authorized with the data; 
otherwise, security and privacy concerns might arise. Making sure that everyone in the organization abides by the 
company's policies, code of ethics, and confidentiality agreements is one of the major challenges in automating HR. 
Employees must understand that doing so could jeopardize organization security or lead to the disclosure of passwords. 
 
3.Conclusion 
In contrast to fluctuations or errors caused by humans, an automated system can provide consistent high accuracy 
results. Productivity will increase, and any time-consuming task will be completed with ease. Automation is viewed 
as a one of the bigger factors in the market success of robotic systems. Because certain tasks are intricate and require 
high precision, pure predefined automation will not always be feasible, necessitating the use of real-time sensors and 
operations. When working in different environments, the robots should automatically recognize parts of it that are 
relevant to the construction they were designed to perform. 
 
When it comes to using automation to handle forensics, the majority of the criticism usually comes from relying too 
heavily on automated digital forensics which will result in some deterioration of expert level knowledge. When more 
complex tasks, such as analysis, are automated, the level of judgment rises, as investigators lose understanding of the 
nitty-gritty concepts of investigation. In the long run, this could lead to poor quality investigations. 
 
Internet of Things has enabled organizations to be more agile and forceful in their pursuit of finding new revenue 
streams. It can potentially change the conventional method of spending money on building, maintaining foundations 
for various products. In industrial automation, any unplanned stops that are caused due to failure in certain components 
can then cause production losses. Industrial automation ranges over various kinds of control systems and can be found 
in a variety of domains. 
 
The majority of cervical cancer causes and deaths in a single year occur in low-income countries. Machine learning 
has recently been used in research studies to aid in the initial screening phase of detection. These techniques necessitate 
the use of healthcare workers who are comfortable with technology, which is not always the case. The generalized 
data input practices need to be changed, which will take a lot of work. Data preparation is a time-consuming challenge 
that, if done incorrectly, might reduce the effectiveness of the model. Everyone involved in the process, including 
non-medical or non-technical stakeholders, should be able to understand it without any trouble. 
 
Institutions who want to modernize their libraries should make sure they have enough funds and time to implement 
the necessary adjustments to successfully convert to an automated e library. In order to avoid wasting time, money, 
or energy, planning library automation will include a proper practicality analysis of the project. In the event that the 
automated system malfunctions or has any issues, there should also be professionals. 
 
Automation can only supplement human labor and increase its effectiveness and productivity; it can never totally 
replace a human. This means that as automation progresses, the operator's skill must also be taken into account. When 
compared to outdated, unconventional methods, automated systems operate by humans 10 times more responsibly, 
which increases the risk of unanticipated incidents that are difficult to foresee and account for with fail safes.

The time needed to complete research and difficult mathematical operations has considerably decreased because of 
technological advancements. The main sciences have benefited much from automation, but social science has not yet 
fully embraced the technology and methodologies it offers. Lack of global standardization in data representation would 
be the biggest obstacle. It would be beneficial to have field-specific norms for file naming and metadata representation. 
If social sciences were to adopt automation, it would take a long time for individuals to adjust to the significant changes 
brought on by standardization and other cutting-edge technologies. To ensure that their study is acknowledged 
globally, people would need to learn new techniques, but the process would move much more quickly if it were well 
mechanized. 
 
Devices that allow for sensor and networked device control have been around for a long time. However, use of home 
automation has not increased significantly since a few years ago. Because home automation is expensive and has few 
installation alternatives, the majority of people are unwilling to invest much time or money in it. Nowadays, remote 
access and secured access are necessities, which raises security problems. This has limitations on when and where it 
may be put because many installations need structural improvements. The majority of those surveyed claimed that 
everyone present in the home could utilize the automatic features, presenting security issues.

Abstract 
This study aims to find out and analyze the influence of active learning and cooperative learning models on learning 
outcomes through student learning motivation at Technical Implementation Unit (UPT) State Vocational High School 
(SMKN) 1 Bulukumba. This research is designed in the form of quantitative research with census methods. The 
population of this study is 3rd-grade students of UPT SMKN 1 Bulukumba, as many as 218 students. Sample 
determination is carried out by saturated sampling techniques so that the final sample is 250 students. The data analysis 
technique used is path analysis. Based on the study results with seven hypotheses submitted, they all proved to mean 
that the whole hypothesis is acceptable. The results showed that indirect influence and learning motivation contributed 
to improving student learning outcomes. However, learning motivation is an intervening variable in this study. Still, 
its contribution is very influential for UPT SMKN 1 Bulukumba students compared to active learning and cooperative 
learning models, while the effect is indirect. Student learning motivation variables have a good moderation influence 
even though partial mediation contributes. 
Keywords 
Active learning, Cooperative learning, learning motivation, and Learning outcomes 
1. Introduction
Education is a conscious and planned effort to realize the conditions and teaching and learning process so that students 
actively develop their potential to gain spiritual power, self-control, intelligence, personality, ethics, and skills needed 
by society, nation, and state (Law No. 20 of 2003). Teachers have different methods of learning; various ways and 
methods used in learning are carried out so that there is no saturation for students with certain methods. Learning 
outcomes are very important because the success of learning carried out in teaching and learning activities can be seen 
from the student's learning results. According to Zacharias et al. (2021), many factors affect learning outcomes but 
can be classified in two ways, namely internal and external. Internal factors arise from the students, such as interest in 
learning, activities in learning, their attitude to the subject matter, motivation, and others. External factors include 
facilities in learning, situations, parental support, learning environment, and others. 
Learning is a series of planned activities; there is good planning in learning success and active learning whose learning 
activities are generally focused on students. Active learning can also improve achievement, motivation, and tolerance. 
In addition, the cooperative learning model has a great contribution to learning and teaching activities. Cooperative 
learning provides great benefits in providing opportunities for learners to develop abilities. It is because, in cooperative 
learning activities, learners are actively required to learn through group cooperation. According to (Sugandi, 2000),

The variables of cooperative learning models towards student learning outcomes through learning motivation are 
positive and significant. On indirect influences, learning motivation was also a good moderation variable of the 
cooperative learning model towards student learning outcomes. UPT SMKN 1 Bulukumba with heterogeneity students 
have different learning motivations, although the motivation to learn jointly becomes something that encourages, 
moves, and directs students in learning (Astuti, 2010). The cooperative learning model in this study shows good 
positive support among fellow students; students are more happy and active in learning if formed in small groups 
(Sugiyanto, 2008). In addition to developing cooperative learning models to achieve learning outcomes, this model is 
also effective in developing social skills for learners.  
6. Conclusion
Based on this study, it can be concluded that active learning and cooperative learning models can affect student 
learning outcomes directly and indirectly through learning motivation. Student learning motivation is a variable that 
has a dominant influence in improving student learning outcomes at UPT SMKN 1 Bulukumba. Students' strong desire 
and enthusiasm to achieve their goals do not reduce their enthusiasm to continue learning to the maximum, not only 
for now but also for the future. The role of learning motivation determines the success of student learning outcomes 
at UPT SMKN 1 Bulukumba, where students believe that their success depends heavily on their motivation. The role 
of student learning motivation, an intervening variable, is very good in supporting student learning outcomes at UPT 
SMKN 1 Bulukumba. However, the cooperative learning model also has a good impact on improving student learning 
outcomes by supporting each other in learning and teachers who actively build a spirit of togetherness, then active 
learning by planting values in school.

Keywords 
Compensation, Performance, Work culture, and Organizational climate. 
1. Introduction
Human resources are the most important factor in improving an organization, so the importance of the role of human 
resources for each institution is expected to improve the performance of lecturers. In improving the performance of 
teachers or employees, the thing that is always noted by the leadership is compensation; each organization should have 
a reasonable compensation determination to support the achievement of goals effectively and efficiently. 
Compensation is all obtained, whether in the form of goods or money, indirect or direct goods that employees receive 
in return for which the organization has been given to them (Ilyas et al., 2022; Umar et al., 2019). 
Another factor that is a lever for increasing H.R.'s performance is the development of work culture. The development 
of work culture is a way to improve work experience by providing opportunities for promotion and occupying new 
positions (Kurniawan et al., 2022; Setianto et al., 2022; Y Yusriadi, Awaluddin, et al., 2020). Work culture is expected 
to be able to and able to change the behavior of lecturers so that the values in the organization can be maintained. 
In addition to the above factors, another factor of particular concern is climate organization. Organizational climate is 
one of the characteristics that we can distinguish from other organizations because it can direct a person's behavior in 
his organization. In organizational climate, there is a characteristic that distinguishes between one organization and 
another that seems invisible, can metamorphose from one condition to a better condition, and can affect employees. 
Employees can work without pressure. This research seeks to uncover how Compensation and Work Culture Towards 
Lecturer Performance Through Organizational Climate at Barombong Shipping Polytechnic.

affects employee performance. Suryanti et al. (2021) found that organizational climate significantly affects 
organizational performance. 
A good and conducive organizational climate can support the success of an institution and vice versa; the better the 
climate condition of an institution's organization, the higher the performance of its employees. It is in line with the 
journal presented research (Harisman et al., 2021) that the organizational climate positively influences employee 
performance. 
Based on these findings, the value of t-count 2,415 is greater than t-table 1.98 with a sig level of 5% and obtained the 
trace coefficient value of the multiplication of p1 and p5 0.167. It indicates a positive direction, so it can be interpreted 
that compensation can positively affect lecturers' performance through the organizational climate positively and 
significantly. From the results of these tests, it can be explained that compensation will affect performance indirectly 
through the organization's climate mediation variable. Appropriate compensation to lecturers will certainly improve 
performance supported by a good organizational climate. 
Rusli et al. (2021) also explained that the important driving factor that makes humans work is the need in humans that 
must be met. In other words, because of the need for man to be fulfilled, man will work and expect rewards from 
where he works, if the return of services received is greater. It means that his position is getting higher, his status is 
getting better, and the fulfillment of needs is enjoyed more. Thus, more employees feel satisfied with the financials 
obtained. It is in line with the journal stated (Rahmitasari et al., 2021) that compensation has a positive and significant 
effect on performance and states that fair compensation will be able to improve employee performance. Organizations 
that cannot provide adequate compensation for their employees and tend not to provide satisfaction will be prone to 
shocks because employees will work with low morale and fragile loyalty. They will affect employee performance. 
Based on the calculation results above, the value of the t-count is 6.183. Therefore, from these results, the value of t-
count 6,183 is greater than t-table 1.98. It is with a significant level of 5%, then obtained the result of the path 
coefficient value p2 p5 of 0.259. It can show a positive value, so it can be interpreted that the work culture can 
influence performance positively and significantly through the organizational climate. Lecturer employment will 
increase if the work culture mediated by the organizational climate also increases. In producing Lecturers who can 
perform well, ma-ka must be accompanied by a good work culture and organizational climate to provide optimal 
results for improving lecturers' pa-da polytechnic shipping. 
6. Conclusion
As the results of this study can be concluded, compensation has a real impact on improving the organization's climate. 
Work culture has a significant effect on improving organizational climate. Compensation has a significant positive 
effect on performance; the work culture has a real effect on improving performance. The organizational climate 
contributes to improving performance; compensation indirectly improves performance through the organizational 
climate. Workforces indirectly improve performance by improving the organization's climate. Organizational climate 
is the condition, condition, and characteristics of the workplace environment that has organizational efficacy and is 
formed through organizational members' behavior, attitudes, and personalities. Mislia et al. (2021) organizational 
climate is a conception that shows the internal condition of the organization, including its environment, and is felt by 
all members during their workplace activities.

1. Introduction
The school is a social organization designed to contribute to an effort to improve the quality of life for the community. 
Efforts to improve the quality of schools need to be organized, regulated, managed, and empowered so that the learning 
process in schools runs smoothly. The school's management in question is related to leadership qualities and teacher 
performance in the learning process to produce better or qualified graduates in improving the quality of education. 
Teacher performance is important because it shows the school's success in achieving the goal. 
Given the importance of teacher performance in school, a teacher must carry out his duties and responsibilities as an 
educator. Many factors affect teacher performance such as teacher competence, learning is said to be successful when 
the activities that take place in the school can facilitate students in the process of transfer of value in the context of the 
formation of the nation character building as stated in the official curriculum. Teacher performance must be built 
professionally through mastery of competencies. This competency is used as a teacher's encouragement in carrying 
out his performance. Competent teachers will carry out teaching and learning tasks in passionate and fun classes 
(Cahaya et al. 2022; H Tamsah et al.  2021).

teachers in building communication is not always effective because some teachers still have a one-way learning 
system, which reduces student feedback to teachers. 
Based on the research results on hypothesis 5, the influence of teacher creativity on teacher performance is positive 
and significant. It is supported by previous research H Tamsah, Haris, et al. (2021). The performance of UPT teachers 
of UPT SMA Branch Office III Gowa Regency increased with teacher creativity. The teacher's ability to design 
teaching materials by adopting scientific principles where previously teachers understood what was most easily 
understood by students so that the transfer of lessons became easier. It was in line with the improvement of teacher 
performance in conducting evaluations or assessments that allow teachers to follow up at work. 
The findings of this study show that the critical role of teachers, especially in instilling knowledge, is very difficult to 
replace. It is so clearly seen when learning is done. The role of teacher creativity is quite good in mediating the 
relationship of competence to teacher performance. The teacher's ability to understand learners and build social 
relationships has contributed to encouraging teacher creativity and performance. Based on the research results on 
hypothesis 6, the indirect influence of competence on teacher performance through teacher creativity is positive and 
significant.  
Based on the research results on hypothesis 7, the indirect influence of soft skills on teacher performance through 
teacher creativity is positive and significant. Teacher creativity is quite good in mediating soft skills related to teacher 
performance. Teachers who can build effective communication through soft skills have a good effect on improving 
teacher creativity. Teachers can know how many problems and solutions can be given in planning teaching materials 
to improve teacher performance by ultimately conducting proper assessments. 
6. Conclusion
Based on this research, it can be concluded that competence, soft skills, and creativity can improve teacher 
performance as the main variable of this research. Directly, competence is a variable that plays a big role in shaping 
teacher performance optimally through pedagogical and social competencies. Creativity has become a solution in 
developing the ability of UPT teachers of SMA Branch III Gowa Regency to understand a learning need and create 
effective learning, just as teachers with social competencies can build good interactions, especially in the classroom. 
In addition, soft skill variables also affect teacher performance with teachers' ability to build good communication 
with teachers and students. Teacher creativity variables that highlight the ability to communicate so that it impacts 
teacher performance, teachers are better at assessing/evaluating the learning process. Indirectly, teacher creativity as 
an intervening variable can moderate the relationship between competence and soft skills to teacher performance. 
However, the role of this variable is partial mediation.

Abstract 
This research aims to determine the contribution of competencies and incentives through teacher performance to 
improve student learning outcomes at Technical Implementation Unit (UPT) elementary schools in Central Mamuju 
Regency. The design of this research is quantitative research, using a quantitative causal descriptive research approach 
with path analysis methods. This research was carried out at 27 Elementary Schools (SD) in the Karissa District 
Education Office of the Central Mamuju Regency. The research conducted showed that teacher competence and 
teacher incentives show a positive and significant contribution to teacher performance (sig.0,00). The results of the 
coefficient analysis prove that simultaneously the competence, incentives, and performance of teachers have a positive 
and significant impact on improving student learning outcomes (sig.0.00). However, partially, incentives have no 
positive and significant effect on improving student learning outcomes (sig.0.82).

Introduction
The low quality of education is still the main issue and is a problem that has not been solved, especially in Central 
Mamuju Regency. From the aspect of learning outcomes of Central Mamuju Regency Elementary School students, 
which is measured based on the average grades of the central Mamuju Regency Elementary School, students’ school 
exams continue to increase every school year. In the 2017/2018 school year, the highest average number of grades in 
several core learning points, namely Indonesian, Mathematics, and Science 266, increased in the following school 
year to 284.4. In the 2019/2020 school year, the highest average school exam score was decreased by 270. It is more 
because learning methods have changed due to covid 19, so schools conduct online learning methods. In general, it 
can be explained that the improvement of student learning outcomes is inseparable from how teachers’ creativity uses 
various learning methods. The demands of creativity and the power of school innovation in responding to social 
situations and conditions become important points to improve the quality of learning in schools, especially teachers, 
considering teachers who are at the forefront of the teaching and learning process, especially in improving student 
learning outcomes. 
2. Literature Review
Ministry of Education Defining competence is the knowledge, skills, and basic norms reflected in behavior and 
thinking. According to Sultan et al. (2021), competence is “ability, proficiency, state of authority, or qualified 
according to the provisions of the law.” Competence is the ability or proficiency of the teacher. According to Brofty, 
“teacher competence is a teacher’s ability to carry out his obligations responsibly and appropriately.” According to 
Mulyasa, “teacher competence is a qualitative picture of the nature of meaningful teacher behavior. Competencies that 
must be possessed” by a teacher at elementary, junior high, and high school levels and equivalent are professional 
competence, personality, and community competencies. While Suharsimi Arikunto stated that the competence of 
teachers is divided into three, namely: Individual Competencies; Professional Competence, and Social Competence

The study results proved that Teacher Performance (Y) on Student learning outcomes (Z) has a positive and significant 
contribution.   In education and teaching, the role of teachers is not only limited to class managers or teachers but also 
as motivators and mentors for their students. The role of a motivator is very important to increase the excitement and 
development of student learning activities (Ikbal et al., 2021; Kurniawan et al., 2022; Nath et al., 2021; Setianto et al., 
2022; Suharyanto et al., 2021). A teacher who has good performance has created in providing motivation and 
strengthens, naming students' potential, and growing their students' creativity, so that there is a dynamic in the teaching 
and learning process.  
 
The study results prove that teacher competence through elementary teacher performance has a positive and significant 
indirect contribution to improving student learning outcomes. Teachers' competencies have a strong influence on 
student learning outcomes. It is contained in the mandate of Law No.14 of 2005 concerning teachers and lecturers. 
Chapter 1 article 1, teachers are professional educators with the main task of educating, teaching, guiding, directing, 
training, assessing, and evaluating learners in early childhood education and formal education, Primary and Secondary 
education. Related to the importance of competence and performance in student learning outcomes, Law No. 14 of 
2005 concerning teachers and lecturers explains that professionals are jobs or activities carried out by a person. It 
becomes a source of income for life that affects quality standards or certain norms and conducts Professional education 
(Mislia et al., 2021). The teacher's success can be reflected in the teacher's success in carrying out tasks as a form of 
performance as a teacher. The thing in question can be reflected in the actualization of competence as a teacher in 
carrying out his duties professionally. The explanation above reflects that teacher performance and professional 
competence are two elements that cannot be separated. 
 
The study results proved that incentives through elementary teachers' performance have indirect contributions with 
positive and significant improvements in student learning outcomes. It is known that incentives are one of the 
motivations for teachers to improve performance in carrying out teaching tasks and functions to their students. It 
proves that incentives to motivate and optimize teacher performance are a strong combination or combination to 
improve student learning outcomes. Incentives do not directly affect student learning outcomes, but if incentives 
become a force in improving teacher performance, it is believed to affect student learning outcomes. Good teacher 
incentives will optimize teacher performance in improving student learning outcomes (Tamsah et al., 2021). 
   
That student's learning outcomes are strongly influenced by the student's abilities and other supporting factors, such 
as the school environment, teaching methods, and parental support (Rahawarin et al., 2020; Zacharias et al., 2021). In 
general, the improvement of student learning outcomes is strongly related to the teacher's ability to provide teaching 
in the classroom. It includes how the teacher interacts with his students and how the teacher's creative ability and 
teaching patterns are given so that students are increasingly improving their ability to understand the teaching 
provided.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research and discussion, it can be concluded that: Competence has a great contribution to 
teacher performance in elementary schools in Central Mamuju Regency; Incentives positively and significantly 
contribute to teacher performance in elementary schools in Central Mamuju Regency.; Competence has a positive 
and significant contribution to the learning outcomes of elementary school students in Central Mamuju Regency; 
Incentives do not have a significant contribution to the learning outcomes of elementary school students in Central 
Mamuju Regency; Teacher Performance has a significant contribution to student learning outcomes at Elementary 
schools in Central Mamuju Regency; Teacher performance can mediate competencies towards improving student 
learning outcomes; Teacher performance can mediate incentives to improve student learning outcomes at elementary 
schools in Central Mamuju Regency 
 
Principals need to further improve competence through various education and training programs, including providing 
opportunities for learning assignments to improve teacher qualifications so that the performance of elementary school 
teachers can be further improved. At the same time, incentives for teachers need to be further improved. For example, 
awarding teachers for their work completion and achievements become a strong motivation in improving the 
performance of elementary school teachers considering that incentives have a major contribution to improving the 
performance of elementary school teachers in Central Mamuju Regency. Therefore, teachers are always required to 
develop and ""optimize their abilities in carrying out the learning process, especially in the use of learning methods 
and media, to improve student achievement or learning outcomes"" at SD Mamuju Tengah Regency

Abstract 
Artificial intelligence is one of the important parts of Industrial Revolution 4.0 which has huge potential in public 
service because it can accelerate processes, automate user tasks, and reduce the number of errors. Not only that, but 
AI could also give $366 billion to Indonesia’s GDP in 2030. In Indonesia, the implementation of AI in public 
services—known as e-government—is carried out with the application of information technology. Thus, the 
objective of this article is to explain the implementation of AI in Indonesia, especially in public services. This article 
used the qualitative research method with a literature review design. In examining the materials related to the topic, 
the authors more focus on secondary data in the form of journal articles, online articles, or government documents. 
This article showed a result that there are several challenges in AI development in Indonesia, including an 
unsupportive environment, lack of awareness and readiness among Indonesian people to use AI technology, 
inadequate human resources, and poor information and communication technology infrastructures. Besides that, 
Indonesia is still depending on imported technology and data misuse happened. To cope with these challenges, 
Indonesia has a plan to use AI technology in several priority issues, such as health, finance, defense, education, 
tourism, as well as food and biotech. Indonesia has invested heavily in media, telecommunications, and information 
technology. AI can be applied in the help desk in the service unit, analysis of service complaints, directing 
complaints to the intended agency, and even answering complaints. Furthermore, Indonesia has succeeded in 
integrating the government system as a database in the implementation of e-government. Its implementation also 
give a positive impact on local government performance, particularly in four aspects, namely costs, budget, time, 
and human resources. These four aspects become more efficient and effective in terms of assurance, infrastructure, 
and employment, so the community needs can be responded—and even fulfilled. The Indonesian government needs 
a regulatory framework that directly supports the requirements and implementation of e-government technology.

1. Introduction
Industrial Revolution 4.0 triggered the appearance of the automatization era which makes human life became easier 
with a system that needs less contribution from humans (Tektona et al. 2021). This era was then connected to 
artificial intelligence (AI) as a method of simulating human intellect in computers to be able to match human 
intelligence. Although AI technology is not a new concept due to the development of technology since the 1950s, 
the use of AI is more advanced in the Industrial Revolution 4.0. The idea behind AI subjects started in 1955, 
especially when John McCarthy had an assumption that all well-known aspects of intelligence and learning domains 
can be simulated by machines (Maulana et al. 2022). At the beginning of its development, AI aimed to solve 
traditional problems on reasoning, learning, planning, representation of knowledge, natural language processing, and 
the ability to move and manipulate objects (Gati et al. 2021). In this contemporary era, AI has the more unique 
ability by providing an in-depth study. The most interesting fact about AI is not about its ability to imitate human 
intelligence, but its ability to view the world differently from the perspective provided by humans (Arief and 
Gustomo 2020). Thus, AI can identify several patterns in big data volumes that are different and will help the 
company or organization to overcome communication crises and potential risks that may give a negative impact on

is capable of AI technology, facilitating the ecosystem of development, and preparing legislation and good 
governance (Supriyanto and Saputra 2022). 
 
Moreover, the Indonesian government has established a roadmap for the successful deployment of e-government 
programs (see Figure 4). This roadmap contains an evolutionary framework that incorporated the current activities 
of the Indonesian government and charts a direction toward realizing the e-government vision as well as sustaining 
the benefits of a mature e-government environment. Nowadays, Indonesia is still in phase two. In order to move 
toward phase three, Indonesia tends to focus on the five critical steps, including (1) creating e-leadership by 
establishing a core high-level e-government body to coordinate and facilitate e-government activities within all 
government levels; (2) enabling the environment by developing appropriate cyber laws and e-government 
legislative; (3) improving the infrastructure of information and communication technology by leveraging the 
utilization of current technology capacity and developing technology infrastructure more efficiently; (4) developing 
a prioritized list of pilot projects; and (5) carrying out change management practices as an integral part of the 
implementation of e-government programs (Harijadi and Satriya 2000).

6. Conclusions  
The implementation of e-government or AI-based public services in Indonesia is conducted through the application 
of information and communication technology. Indonesia decided to enhance its AI capabilities to keep up with the 
other countries that have started applying AI in various fields. By implementing AI in public services, the 
Indonesian government can increase its responsiveness and quality of service to the public, allowing the public to 
access the governments services more transparently and efficiently, and leveraging the scope and accessibility of 
government’s services and public infrastructures. However, Indonesia is lagging in the adoption of e-government 
compared to developed countries. This is Indonesia still struggles to fight some challenges, including (1) the 
technological literacy of public apparatuses is still low; (2) the inter-governmental system is not integrated; (3) lack 
of financial support; (4) difficulty to translate the National Development Planning System in digital space; (5) 
limited access to the Internet; (6) lack of e-leadership; and (7) conflict of interest.  
 
Indonesia then implemented several strategies to cope with those challenges. The Ministry of Information and 
Communication has created a scheme of the national information system which mentioned the relations established 
by e-government that involved three stakeholders, namely the government, the business sector, and citizens. 
Indonesia then published the National Strategy for AI (Stranas KA) in August 2020 to provide a blueprint for AI 
development’s long-term strategy in Indonesia. Besides that, the Ministry of Communication and Information will 
contribute to improving the utilization and adoption of AI technology in a trustworthy, thrifty, and prudent manner 
while adhering to the national identity. The government also established a roadmap for the successful deployment of 
e-government programs in Indonesia.

Therefore, it can be said that this research has fulfilled the objective to explain several challenges faced by the 
Indonesian government in implementing e-government or AI-based public service, as well as analyze strategies 
developed by the government to deal with these challenges. This research can be useful material or reference for 
policymakers, especially the Indonesian government, in developing and implementing AI in the public sector. 
Through this research, the policymakers will be able to better understand about challenges in implementing AI and 
strategies that have been applied by the government.

Abstract 
This research aims to discover and elaborate on new models in investigative performance that are influenced by 
development by creating work, responsibility, and human resources capacity of Police Members (POLRI) at the West 
Sulawesi Daerah Level Police (POLDA). This research was carried out at the West Sulawesi Regional Police, lasting 
for 2 (two) months, namely June to July 2021. The population of this study is West Sulawesi Police investigators, as 
many as 102 people, with saturated sampling techniques, so the study sample is 102 people. Data collection techniques 
are carried out through observation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, while data analysis uses path 
analysis. The results showed that the performance of the West Sulawesi Regional Police investigation could be 
positively and significantly affected by the development of competence, work creativity, responsibility, and human 
resources capacity. The variable of responsibility contributes the most to improving the performance of the 
investigation as an investigator. There is a value of integrity and responsibility in the self that can fairly provide 
evidence so that the parties do not feel aggrieved that they increasingly believe that the investigator is very professional 
in expanding his duties and responsibilities. In addition, work creativity is also able to affect the performance of the 
investigation with the critical thinking power of the investigator in facing diverse situations, as well as the capacity of 
human resources where investigators with appropriate educational qualifications contribute well to the performance 
of the investigation. Indirectly, the intervening variable HR capacity has the best mediation role in mediating 
competency development to investigative performance. Thus, it is important to consider the role of human resources 
responsibility and capacity to improve the performance of the West Sulawesi Regional Police investigation.

1. Introduction
Human resource management is an important focus in organizational development to achieve competitive advantage. 
Development leads to learning opportunities designed for individual development. The development of employees is 
a process of systematically learning and practicing improving competence and performance in their current work and 
prepare themselves for their roles and responsibilities in the future. 
The demands of the Police task in the current reform era are becoming more and more complex. A police institution 
is an institution that carries out public service function. This institution is required to provide the best service to the 
community by showing the performance of professional unity and reliability in its field. The services provided to the 
community are contained in the law enforcement tasks carried out by the Police. In this case, the Reserve function is 
an investigator / auxiliary investigator. 
As in the formulation of Article 14 paragraph (1) g of Law No. 2 of 2002, it is stated that in the implementation of 
basic duties as in Article 13, the Police oversee investigating and investigating all criminal acts following the criminal 
procedure law and other regulations in the legislation. The criminal justice system is a large system in which several

for the institution and society. Responsibility is closely related to obligations; obligations are imposed on a person. 
One of the responsibilities of the Police in trying to find the facts of the case is the investigation. The responsibility of 
the Police regarding the investigation is the process of collecting facts and information, which certainly requires 
enthusiasm, firmness, and concern for the condition. The West Sulawesi Regional Police showed that investigators 
had paid attention to the principles used in the criminal law to ensure human rights in improving the performance of 
the investigation. 
 
The variable influence of HR capacity on investigative performance is positive and significant. This research is 
supported by research (Fauzi & Akbar, 2020; Kadarusman, 2019; Taona et al., 2018). The educational background of 
investigators on the hr capacity variable plays an important role in improving the performance of investigations in the 
West Sulawesi Regional Police. In the investigation process, the west Sulawesi Regional Police investigators have 
been equipped with standard operating procedures (SOP) and Regulation No. 6 of 2019 concerning Criminal 
Investigation. It becomes a more professional and proportionate police investigator in criminal investigations.  
 
Competency development is a remarkable trend because competence is one of the instruments used in performance 
assessment. The influence of competency development variables on the performance of investigations through work 
creativity is positive and significant. The findings of this study are supported by the research of Shafira, D. (2020) in 
his research showing that the performance of investigators is more optimal with the involvement of institutions in 
developing investigator competence. Also, competence is a basic tool for competing. For this reason, competence 
must be owned as a provision in competing.  
 
The influence of competency development variables on the performance of investigations through responsibility is 
positive and significant. The findings of this study are reinforced by Ahral et al. (2021) research, which concluded 
that competence affects the commitment and responsibility of police investigators. The West Sulawesi Regional Police 
Institution, through the development of competencies carried out, has encouraged the understanding of investigators 
of the importance of responsibility in working. The performance of the investigation is achieved because there is a 
series of investigators' work following the investigation procedures, among others, carried out following their 
competence and the existence of responsibilities as evidence of integrity in the task. The place on the act of searching 
and locating an event that is suspected to be a criminal act. While on the investigation, a heavy point the emphasis is 
placed on the act of finding and collecting evidence. The investigation aims to make light of the criminal acts found 
and determine the culprit. 
 
The influence of competency development variables on investigative performance through HR capacity is positive 
and significant. The findings of this study are reinforced by Debby et al. (2021) which concluded that the better the 
competence of the investigator, the better his integrity in conducting investigations. The suitability of the investigator's 
educational qualifications is an important indicator that contributes to the improvement of the performance of 
investigators in the West Sulawesi Regional Police. It is also following the provision that police officials who can be 
appointed as full investigator officials must meet the conditions of rank and appointment. Namely, at least the rank of 
assistant second lieutenant of the Police; or who is an officer ranked subordinate to the second lieutenant if in a police 
sector there is no investigating officer with the rank of second lieutenant's assistant; appointed and appointed by the 
police chief of the Republic of Indonesia. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on this research, it can be concluded that the performance of investigations at the West Sulawesi Regional 
Police can be positively and significantly affected by the development of competence, work creativity, responsibility, 
and human resources capacity. The responsibility variable is the most contributing to improving the performance of 
the investigation. It proves that there is a value of integrity and responsibility in themselves, institutions, and society 
as an investigator. The ability of investigators to provide evidence so that the parties do not feel aggrieved believe that 
the investigator is very professional in expanding his duties and responsibilities. In addition, work creativity is also 
able to affect the performance of the investigation with the critical thinking power of the investigator in facing diverse 
situations, as well as the capacity of human resources where investigators with appropriate educational qualifications 
contribute well to the performance of the investigation. Indirectly, the intervening variable hr capacity has the best 
mediation role in mediating competency development to investigative performance. Thus, it is important to consider 
the part of human resources' responsibility and capacity to improve the performance of the West Sulawesi Regional 
Police investigation.

Competency Management, Job Satisfaction, Career Development, and Job Quality. 
1. Introduction
Job satisfaction is an important aspect of strategic management that is sometimes discussed whether in the academic 
or practical scope and business. Job satisfaction has a considerable impact on the organization's productivity, either 
directly or indirectly (Rahawarin et al., 2020; Tehubijuluw Zacharias et al., 2021). Employee job satisfaction is an 
important factor because the satisfaction it gets will also determine a positive attitude towards work. 
The level of job satisfaction can be achieved if an employee in his job has competencies that are in his field of work. 
Competence emphasizes efforts to utilize knowledge and work skills in achieving performance optimization. Thus, 
competence is an effort that a person has with the level of knowledge and skills and other internal factors related to 
performing his duties and work. 
Good competence is related to the task of a person who tends to improve the quality of the work he does, and when a 
person has a good level of competence for the work he does, he will be able to complete the work well. Managing 
competencies is very helpful to find out the extent to which an employee can work optimally and contribute to the 
wishes of his organization (Kurniawan et al., 2022; Mislia et al., 2021; Setianto et al., 2022). Managing competencies 
is important for planning, assisting, and developing performance. Competency management as a practical step is used 
with a formal and organized approach to ensure that human resources are talented to meet organizational goals.

Positively and significantly, competency management is an important concept in the organization's role of managing 
the potential of human resources Rosha et al. (2013). This concept triggers the spirit of employees developing their 
careers because the organization gives an offer and ultimately encourages their satisfaction in their work. 
 
Positively and significantly, competency management encourages organizations to make improvements to be placed 
in a profitable position, with competency management encouraging quality of work and satisfaction for employees 
(Salina  et al., 2012). 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the study results, it can be concluded that competency management is an organizational offer that makes 
employees' careers better, namely, employees are easier to participate in training, mutations, and ease of promotion 
based on competence. Career development and work quality as intervening variables also directly influence job 
satisfaction. The variable with the smallest influence is competency management on job satisfaction through career 
development; not all employees feel job satisfaction because organizational considerations in career development 
consider less employee tenure but more competence.

Abstract 
This study conducted on junior high school students in the Larompong District of Luwu Regency analyses whether 
blended learning and learning facilities affect motivation in the Larompong District of Luwu Regency. To study 
whether blended learning, learning facilities, and motivation affect the learning achievements of junior high school 
students in Larompong District, Luwu Regency; and to analyze whether blended learning and learning facilities affect 
learning achievement through motivation. This research approach is quantitative with associative research types or 
examines causal relationships. This research was carried out at junior high schools in Larompong District, Luwu 
Regency, namely SATAP Lumaring State Junior High School, Larompong 1St State Junior High School, Rante Alang 
State Junior High School, Mulya Synergy Pesantren Junior High School, Tahfidz Al-Quran Nurut Tauhid Middle 
School, and Nur Elhaq Islamic Junior High School, with a total sample of 258 students from 730 students. Sample 
quantity determination technique with solving technique and sample withdrawal through Nonprobability Sampling 
technique. Data analysis techniques use path analysis as well as Sobel tests. Based on the study results, it was found 
that Blended learning and learning facilities had a positive and significant effect on students' learning motivation in 
junior high school in Larompong District, Luwu Regency. Furthermore, Blended learning, learning facilities, and 
student motivation in education also have a positive and significant effect on student learning achievement. Blended 
learning and learning facilities positively and significantly impact learning achievement through encouragement as an 
intervening variable in students.

Blended Learning, Learning Facilities, Learning Motivation, and Learning Achievement. 
1. Introduction
One reflection of the success of education can be seen in student learning achievements. In this case, the school as an 
educational institution must be able to produce outstanding students, where each student's accomplishments can be 
seen from the student's learning outcomes. Technological advances that several countries can utilize in building better 
education must also be used by Indonesia so that the national education system will be better and of better quality.  
Motivation plays an important role that is a driving factor for students to show better learning achievements. A student 
who has a high motivation to study will diligently do all the assigned tasks (Cynthia et al., 2016). In addition, student 
achievement is also influenced by the learning model applied in schools, one of which is the blended 
learning model. Blended learning involves students in online education outside the classroom in students accessing 
material delivery. In contrast, at face-to-face meetings, students can ask questions about things that have not been 
understood during online learning (Ilyas et al., 2022).

The hypothesis acceptance criterion is if the influence between variables has a significant value smaller than 0.05 with 
a confidence level of 95%. They are guided by the findings of this study which obtained a calculation value of 3,842 
at a significance of 0.000. where the matter of the variable importance of the learning facility of 0.000 is smaller than 
0.05 (0.000 < 0.05). And the coefficient of the indirect path is positively valued at 0.106, so the hypothesis is 
accepted. which means learning facilities have a positive and significant effect on learning achievement through 
motivation as an intervening variable in junior high school students in Larompong District, Luwu Regency. The 
findings of this study have implications that students' learning achievements in schools can be directly influenced by 
learning facilities and indirectly mediated by high motivation in learning. This learning motivation factor needs to be 
a concern for the school. Where (A’yun et al., 2017) revealed that ""through learning motivation, passion and passion 
in learning students will be encouraged, as well as the existence of learning facilities that if available completely then 
the spirit in learning will also arise itself. The existence of good learning facilities in supporting learning activities can 
foster the motivation for students to learn. Through this learning motivation, students will be more excited in learning 
so that it will affect good learning achievements as well."" 
5. Conclusion
Experience in the performance of village midwives has more influence on the variable experience. The indicator of 
long work (X1.1) is an average of 4.50. The respondents' characteristics found that midwives with a working period 
of fewer than two years are 19.23%. The frequency of 15≤4≤6 years of 33.33% or a frequency of 26, and ≥6 years 
of 47.43% or a frequency of 37.  Training on the performance of village midwives has a negligible influence on 
midwife performance with greater t-count compared to t-table (8,440≥ 1,995) and P= 0.040 ≥ 0.05 with a coefficient 
value of 0, 312, the coefficient indicates that the better and higher the level of midwife training, the better and higher 
the resulting performance. 
The work environment on the performance of village midwives has a more significant number than the t-table (7699
≥ 1,995) and P = 0.00 ≤ 0.05 with a coefficient value of 0.915. The coefficient can show that the more adequate the 
work environment, the better the midwives' quality and performance results. Dominant variables to midwife 
performance evidenced by the work environment symbolized as X3 directly impacting midwives showing t-count 
must have a more significant number than t-table (7699≥ 1,995) and P = 0.00 ≤ 0.05 with a coefficient value of 0.915. 
The coefficient can show that the more adequate the work environment, the better the midwives' quality and 
performance results.

Abstract 
This research aims to analyze the impact of education and training and fluency competence on overall performance, 
both directly and indirectly. This type of research is quantitative research. The population in this study is the entire 
quantity of ASN in the West Sulawesi Province Human Asset Improvement company, which amounts to 218 people, 
and the pattern is sixty-nine ASN. The collection of information used is questionnaires and documentation. Data 
collected through questionnaires are analyzed with the help of the SPSS smart PLS 3.2.8 program. The results showed 
that leadership training affects the soft competence of employees and improves the performance of human resources 
in West Sulawesi Province. Likewise, leadership training affects employee performance in developing human 
resources of West Sulawesi Province companies. Different conclusions also show that weak competence affects the 
overall performance of employees in human resource companies in West Sulawesi Province. Similarly, management 
education affects performance if mediated with the help of tender employee competencies in the human resource 
development organization of West Sulawesi Province.

1. Introduction
With the widespread changes in Indonesian employment, law No. 43 of 1999 was issued on Amendments to Law No. 
8 of 1974 concerning the Idea of a common call. It is believed that the administrative law faculty can require all 
changes in employment. It is believed that Civil Servants (PNS) can have the option to build the positions they have 
depending on their portrayal. The capacity of Government employees plays an important role in the progress period 
to work on increasing Government employees who should be considered so that they can build human resources and 
later be useful in the government environment. 
""The role of Education and Leadership Training (DIKLATPIM) to improve soft competence and employee 
performance of the Human Resources Development Agency in West Sulawesi Province."" Thus, to build the 
understanding of civil servants, the task of public authorities is to hold administrative preparation exercises that will 
be assisted through training pathways. It tends to be concluded that the author needs to direct behavioral exploration 
in the nearest Business Entity if we look at the series of experiences, especially the Human Resources Improvement 
Organization in the West Sulawesi Region. 
Complete tasks and responsibilities are the best way to produce high-quality output. The performance of workers in a 
company is declared effective, and success in achieving ideals can be influenced by factors that come from within the 
organization, including education and training, employment, and the soft competence of workers. It is based on the

paragraph five). Management training aims to provide insight, understanding, knowledge, competencies, attitudes, 
and behavior in equipment management to meet leadership requirements in positive structural positions. 
Based on government policies, education software and leadership training can be a source of educational device media 
organized to become operational leaders. Therefore, the extent of leadership education and schooling must guarantee 
the formation of a person's character in the determinant who has the operational perception to build a good and 
appropriate government. To form a device like this, this management education and training can be used as a first step 
or perhaps in a further way, regulating the behavior of the mastery of the apparatus in shaping itself as a leader who 
can sometimes face changes from their respective environments. 
Soft competency is closely related to managing work processes, relationships between people, and building interaction 
with others, for example, leadership, communication, interpersonal relationships, and others. Generally, all employees 
are given the training to improve their abilities and skills to be by the company's wishes. But in the future, it is still 
far from found that the improvement of ability and knowledge is never enough because of the large number of smart 
employees but lack of attitude. So, it takes extra gentle competence. In conclusion, soft competency is a part that can 
affect the development of hard competency and the performance of a person. The motives and innate factors of self-
concept will result in skillful behavior and result in work (performance). 
This research relates to the opinion recommended by Yusriadi, bin Tahir, et al. (2020). They state that employee 
performance in a company can be said to be the best and most successful when achieving goals to inspire several 
elements, namely schools as employee tender competencies based on personnel's capacity to complete their 
responsibilities and obligations to produce better output. The maximum performance can be obtained if the business 
entity can direct and improve the capabilities of workers who can work more optimally. 
5. Conclusion
DIKLATPIM can be implemented to improve the competence of employees, which can later be used as a support to 
improve and optimize the performance of employees. From this research, some conclusions can be drawn where 
leadership training is very influential on employee soft competence, meaning that better leadership training will grow 
employee soft competence. Similarly, the leadership training that has been carried out affects employee performance. 
Different conclusions also show that soft competence is very influential on the overall performance of employees 
against human resources companies of West Sulawesi Province; this means that the higher the tender competence it 
will improve employee performance. Similarly, leadership training impacts performance is mediated using the 
competence of auction apparatus in business entities to improve human assistance in West Sulawesi Province, meaning 
that management education can improve performance if mediated with the help of auction competencies.

Abstract 
This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of agricultural and extension facilities on production results through the 
effectiveness of the work of farmer groups in the Jeneponto Regency. The research method used is a quantitative 
research method with a sample of 100 people. Data collection techniques use questionnaires—data technique with path 
analysis techniques (path analysis). The results of this study show that agricultural and extension facilities are the most 
influential on the effectiveness of the work of farmer groups. Agricultural facilities, counseling, and work 
effectiveness also have a positive and significant effect on the production results of farmer groups. In addition, 
agricultural facilities and counseling also have a positive and significant effect on production results through the 
effectiveness of the work of farmer groups in the Jeneponto Regency. 
Keywords 
Agricultural Facilities, Extension, Work Effectiveness, and Production Results. 
1. Introduction
Agriculture is an interesting issue in the country due to a phenomenon where rice productivity tends to increase 
insignificantly. Based on data from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia (2019), rice productivity 
in Indonesia from 2014 to 2018 only increased by 0.52%. As rice productivity in 2014 up to 51.35%, in 2015 increased 
to 53.41%. While in 2016, it decreased to 52.36%; in 2017, it again decreased to 51.65%; and in 2018, it increased to 
51.92%. 
Agricultural production results need to be improved by paying attention to aspects of the effectiveness of farmers' 
work due to the decline in farmer production growth, one of which is due to the productivity of rice farming businesses 
that are less effective (H Tamsah & Nessa, 2019). This study targeted the Jeneponto Regency Farmer Group because 
researchers suspected that the effectiveness of the work and farmers' produce in Jeneponto county still needs attention. 
Some of the problems in the Jeneponto Regency include less fertile and rocky land, seeds that often do not bear fruit 
and do not grow, the quality of seeds given by the government is good. However, distribution to farmers tends to be 
slow, and agricultural production is still low. Thus, it is necessary for the efforts of the Jeneponto Regency government 
to increase the effectiveness of work and agricultural production by considering aspects of agricultural facilities and 
aspects of providing counseling. 
Agricultural extension is also very important in increasing work effectiveness and farmers' production. Counseling in 
agriculture is a continuous process to convey information to farmers and technology that can be useful for farmers 
and their families (Indahingwati et al., 2019) to encourage farmers to work more effectively and produce high 
agricultural production. Agricultural extension is an educational process with a non-formal education system to change 
the behavior of adults to have better knowledge, skills, and attitudes. So, targets can choose and make decisions from 
2516","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-22, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
(Yusriadi et al., 2019), there is a need to increase collaboration between farmers and farmer groups by increasing the 
number of funding agencies from both the Central Government and Local Government and increasing the cost of field 
extension agencies to increase rice production in West Java. 
The fifth hypothesis (H5) is to suspect that business performance significantly impacts the production output of farmer 
groups in the Jeneponto Regency. The calculated value of the business efficiency value is 2,282 with a value of 0.025 
and a value of 0.05 or sig. 0.025 is smaller than 0.05 (0.025 <0.05). Thus, work effectiveness has a positive and 
significant impact on the production output of farmer groups in the Jeneponto Regency. The fifth hypothesis (H5) can 
therefore be adopted. According to a study by (Ansar et al., 2019; Bahri et al., 2021; S. Z. Bin Tahir & Rinantanti, 
2016; Mastulen et al., 2021; S. Z. B. Tahir, 2015, 2017; Yusuf et al., 2021), this finding is important for an organization 
because work efficiency can achieve the goals of farmer groups, one of which is to increase agricultural production. 
According to the theory put forward by (A’yun et al., 2017; Amri et al., 2018; S. Z. B. Tahir & Rinantanti, 2018), 
effectiveness is the key to success in the body. 
5. Conclusion
The more efficient the agricultural opportunities, the more efficient the work of the farmer group in Jeneponto, and if 
the agricultural opportunities are inadequate, the effectiveness of the farmer group will be reduced. If the consultations 
implemented improve and become more targeted, the efficiency of the farmer groups in the Jeneponto Regency area 
will increase, and if the consultation is not good and not on target, the effectiveness of the farmer group in Jeneponto 
will be reduced. If agricultural facilities become more, the production of farmer groups in Jeneponto will increase, and 
vice versa; if agricultural opportunities are inadequate, the production of farmer groups in Jeneponto will decrease. If 
the consultations carried out increase and reach the target, the output of the farmer group in Jeneponto will increase. 
Still, if the advice given is not good, the production output of the farmer group in Geneponto will be reduced. The work 
done will be more effective, and then the output of the peasant group in Jeneponto will increase. Still, if the work done 
becomes more and more ineffective, the production output of the farmer group in Genepont will be reduced.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine and analyze the effect of Training Effectiveness on Teacher Performance Through Soft 
Competencies and Teacher Capabilities at the UPT SMKN Branch of Regional Office V Bulukumba-Bantaeng. 
Research methods are designed in the form of quantitative research. The population of this study is a teacher in 4 UPT 
SMKN Branch Dinas Region V Bulukumba-Bantaeng (SMKN 1, 4, 5, and 8) as many as 121 teachers. Sample 
determination is carried out by total sampling techniques to involve the entire population as a research sample. The 
data analysis technique used is path analysis. There are seven hypotheses proposed in this study, the whole hypothesis 
is accepted. Research shows that training effectiveness contributes greatly to teacher performance compared to soft 
competence and teacher capability. Indirectly, soft competence and teacher capability variables become partial 
mediation, meaning that the direct influence is still effective in influencing teacher performance. As a result of 
research, training effectivity can directly affect teacher performance and indirectly through soft competence and 
teacher capabilities. UPT SMKN Branch of Regional Office V Bulukumba-Bantaeng through the effectiveness of 
training, schools can conduct training based on school needs, targets, programs, principles, and implementation of 
learning. Effective training has enabled teachers to shape themselves by improving soft competence better in their 
leadership in class, communication, and thinking. Also, the teacher's capabilities become better, especially in 
understanding the content or material taught, applying concepts, and implementing learning. Effective training in the 
UPT SMKN Branch of Regional Office V Bulukumba-Bantaeng is considered an important means of improving the 
responsibility of teachers as professional educators. It is oriented to teachers' ability to improve the ability to plan to 
learn, manage to learn, conduct learning assessments, and carry out tasks and responsibilities professionally.

Effectiveness of training, soft competence, teacher capability, and  teacher performance 
1. Introduction
Teacher performance is an important element in education, but it is also a determinant of the high quality of education. 
Teachers carry out teacher performance in carrying out the duties of a teacher as an educator. Decree of the Minister 
of State Apparatus Utilization and Bureaucratic Reform No. 16 of 2009, teachers also have the task of educating 
students by following norms and values according to religion. Nevertheless, not a few teachers in the teaching and 
learning process did not show the performance expected by the school. Teachers in their profession in carrying out 
tasks are given many opportunities, one of which is training them. Training is the development of attitudes, knowledge, 
or skills of systematic behavior patterns required by a teacher to perform a task or job adequately (Cahaya et al., 2022). 
The effectiveness of teacher training as the achievement of teacher training goals is reflected in the improvement of 
teacher competencies (knowledge and skills) and changes in attitudes. 
In addition to training effectiveness, the teacher's ability in soft competence is also indispensable. Teachers must have 
soft skills, including warm relationships, making an easy approach, and building relationships constructively (Tamsah 
et al., 2021). The teacher's capabilities can be demonstrated through the content of the knowledge he teaches. Teachers 
who have the ability (capability) always choose the right learning methods, models, approaches, and techniques

competence on teacher performance. Soft competence is an ability possessed by teachers based on good attitudes such 
as communicating, thinking, forming a solid team, and leadership. Well-managed soft competencies can improve 
teacher performance in learning. 
 
Based on the results in hypothesis 6, the influence of teacher capability variables on the performance of UPT SMKN 
teachers branch of regional office V Bulukumba-Bantaeng is positive and significant. The findings of this study are 
supported by research Tamsah et al. (2021), who concluded there is a significant positive influence on teacher 
performance. Teachers with good capabilities continue to drive changes and improvements in the teaching system, 
such as designing and managing to learn well and professionally carrying out tasks and responsibilities (Hasmin 
Tamsah et al., 2020). Teacher with their capabilities has become a characteristic of competent and professional 
teachers, showing high partisanship in managing to learn effectively. It has a direct impact on improving its 
performance.  
 
Based on the results in hypothesis 7, the influence of variable training effectiveness on teacher performance through 
the soft competence of UPT SMKN Branch of Regional Service V Bulukumba-Bantaeng is positive and significant. 
The effectiveness of training at the UPT SMKN Branch of Regional Office V Bulukumba-Bantaeng has created 
teachers with high competence. It is not only in understanding knowledge techniques but also in personality by 
developing soft competencies. Teachers become more and more responsible in their work by always participating and 
complying with the provision of the school. Teachers become more skilled in building communication. The 
implementation of effective training has encouraged the improvement of personal values with soft competence and 
impacts improving performance (Rahawarin et al., 2020). 
 
Based on the results in hypothesis 8, the influence of variable training effectiveness on teacher performance through 
the capabilities of UPT SMKN teachers branch of regional service V Bulukumba-Bantaeng is positive and significant. 
Teachers are better able to design and manage learning better. Effective training implementation followed by teachers 
can support the improvement of abilities/capabilities in their duties as educators so that they positively impact their 
performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
UPT SMKN Branch of Regional Office V Bulukumba-Bantaeng through the effectiveness of training, schools are able 
to conduct training based on school needs, targets, programs, principles and implementation of learning. Based on this 
research, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of training can directly affect teacher performance and indirectly 
through soft competence and teacher capabilities. Effective training has enabled teachers to shape themselves by 
improving soft competence better in their leadership in class, communication, and thinking. Also, the teacher's 
capabilities become better, especially in understanding the content or material taught, applying concepts, and 
implementing learning. Effective training in the UPT SMKN Branch of Regional Office V Bulukumba-Bantaeng is 
considered an important means of improving the responsibility of teachers as professional educators. Oriented teachers 
can enhance the ability to plan to learn, manage to learn, conduct learning assessments, and carry out the professional 
implementation of duties and responsibilities.

Abstract 
It is common to classify patients that arrive at an intensive care unit (ICU) by means of a classification based on 
gender, age and health record. However, it is interesting and helpful to take advantage of additional data to propose 
alternative patient segmentation that might help allocate more efficiently the existing infrastructure, supplies, 
medical staff. In this investigation several ICU patients’ segmentations were implemented and compared. Different 
from a supervised task like classification, where datasets have to be a priori labelled to train and to test prediction 
models, clustering algorithms requires no labelling. Instead, data are grouped according to their degree of similarity. 
The research was carried out following a 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. 
During the analysis, a large database with record of the medical care received by patients at the ICU of a public 
hospital located in the south of Chile was preprocessed and analyzed. During the design, several datasets were 
prepared to conduct experiments. At this point, the advantages and disadvantages of different clustering algorithms 
were analyzed and compared, selecting Simple K-Means Algorithm (SKMA) and Expectation-Maximization 
Clustering (EMC) to proceed with the investigation. Whereas SKMA creates clusters of equal variance, EMC 
assumes a Gaussian distribution of data. The phase of development was carried out using the data mining software 
WEKA 3.9.6. To complete the investigation, four datasets of five, ten, fifteen, and twenty thousand ICU records 
were used. Since no target class was defined, the clustering was the result of applying the selected algorithms: EMC 
and SKMA. For both cases, different number of clusters (k) were required to establish a comparison.   Results 
revealed clear differences in the outputs generated by each clustering algorithm. For instance, with 5 clusters (k=5) 
EMC distributes data in the following proportions: 19%, 15%, 10%, 43%, and 28%. With SKMA, instead, the 
proportion were: 44%, 13%, 10%m 9%, and 24%. In conclusion, the investigation showed that popular clustering 
algorithms such as EMC and SKMA can be used for segmenting not only consumers but also ICU patients 
according to criteria that are not easy to visualize with classical tools and techniques. An adequate segmentation can 
provide valuable information to help estimate the requirement of medical staff, supplies and infrastructure, and also 
to define specific healthcare services.

1. Introduction
The recent sanitary crisis has revealed the difficulties that public health systems face to cope with an unusual 
growing number of incoming patients. In many cases, the situation was already complicated before the COVID-19 
pandemic and the crisis only made things even worse. 
The unexpected increase in the demand for medical care catalyzed the creativity and forced the improvement in the 
management of the limited existing resources such as medical personnel, supplies and hospital infrastructure. 
Along with new challenges, innovative technologies have also emerged to facility the work in health centers and 
hospitals. Some good examples of these widely accepted new trends are: the so-called P4 medicine, where P4 stands 
for Predictive, Personalized, Preventive and Participatory (Ruiz and Velásquez, 2023), the advances in clinical 
medicine based on artificial intelligence (Pan et al., 2022), and the increasing use of machine learning algorithms to 
detect and to diagnose diseases using existing patient data (Kejriwal and Rajagopalan, 2023).

6. Conclusion
Contrary to classical segmentation approaches based on geography or demography where clusters are rather evident, 
segmentations generated using clustering require a deeper analysis. This investigation presented the experimental 
results of applying two popular clustering algorithms to segment the patients received the ICU of n public hospital. 
A database containing twenty thousand records was used in this work. 
Nowadays, clustering algorithms are widely used to identify patterns and classify unlabeled data by means of 
grouping similar data points in clusters that shares some degree of similarity. This application has been getting more 
attention in recent years because it can be of great help in decision making for different areas. Including that related 
to medical care and services. 
Both SKMA and EMC are iterative optimization methods to cluster data points. Depending on the needs and the 
number of iteration is possible to determine the optimal number of clusters. Although interesting, it is not always 
practical. In some cases, when the number of cluster is too large, while few of them concentrate much of the data, 
other clusters have only a few data points. In this research the optimal number was found to be 8 clusters. With 
EMC the proportion of the resulting cluster showed that one cluster had 49% of data and four had less than 5% of 
data. SKMA, instead, generated a more balance set of clusters with proportion that fluctuated between 5% and 30% 
of data point.  
An interesting fact is that the size of the larger datasets (DS-05, DS-10, DS-15, and DS-20) affected the proportions 
of the generated clusters. Is did not occur the same to the smallest dataset DS-05 (5,000 records), independently 
from the values of k.

A segmentation of ICU patients based on machine learning algorithms can lead to clusters that are not obvious. 
However, that unusual segmentations can help decision makers define better services and optimize the allocation of 
resources for each group of patients. 
In conclusion, both clustering algorithms SKMA and EMC can be of great help when applied of the segmentation of 
patients. But, the interpretation of the clusters requires additional effort since is not evident.

Abstract 
For many academics, determining the placement and size of an electric car charging station could be a brand-new 
challenge. This study builds a comprehensive objective function that considers geographic data, building costs, and 
running costs. The cost of the land and the distribution transformer is included in the objective part of construction costs. 
Running costs take into account power supply losses and traffic flow restrictions, which accurately and thoroughly 
captures the core issue with the placement and sizing of electric vehicle charging stations. Electric cars have their 
challenges of shape, structure, and further optimization. The feasibility of getting a charging station also plays a vital 
role in the greater effectiveness of these cars.

1. Introduction
For the last several years, the increasing cost of fuel and oil has become a severe issue for people like you, me, and the 
people. Life-based IC engine vehicles is becoming a heavy burden. The EVs have appeared in the picture of obligation 
to overcome these fear and release loaded from the cost of fuel and oil. Serious environmental problems brought by 
automobile emissions, energy savings, and emission reduction are becoming a new task for the world. New energy 
vehicles can be the way to do this task. From the industry experts’ predictions, by the end of 2025, China's 20% to 30% 
of passenger vehicle sales will come from the Electrical vehicle (EV), charging-type hybrid vehicles and other new 
energy vehicle. The number of urban traffic is electric ones it becomes primary, When we talk about Electrical vehicle, 
We also need to think about its power supply like we have in our petrol pumps or i can say gas stations but in EV 
automobile industry we have to provide electric supply to the each station which is not easy and country like India, 
there million or billions of rural area in which to provide this kind of facility would be more difficult then providing it to 
the country like United States of America or Countries in Europe. 
To overcome this many researches has given many ways, but the one which is more accurate and would be more 
feasible was to provide a EV charging stations at a certain distance. and the allocation would be more difficult 
in rural areas. Tesla inc. has distributed its EV charging stations with the help of geographical information and their 
car’s battery avg. Power consumption and its power to run their EV. Then there will be land cost comes into the picture, 
while selecting the area and the actual required size would be more different because there are already platforms 
available like gas stations; we can cut the land cost by tie-up with the government's gas stations or public sector's units 
like Shell inc. While collection the geographical information, it is almost a waste of time because companies like shell 
or other fuel companies already have data ready with them. However, the battery capacity of these cars continues to 
severely restrict their autonomy (Figure 1-7).

6. Conclusion 
With the increase in Greenhouse Pollutions and environment degradation, EVs have proved themselves very beneficial. 
Although, it also uses natural resource which degrades environment but it has greater efficiency and can be optimized 
further. Cost is the main barrier to the EVs. The usage of petrol, diesel and other type of fuels are costly and soon will 
not be available. It may end after about a century or so. In lieu of the rising situations, it is necessary to take certain 
actions to save the planet. Government has also motivated people to use fewer natural resources and take a step towards 
environment through these different sources. With the tech a inch far, we may acknowledge people to use these type of 
vehicles and give a helping hand in saving the environment. So, educate the near ones to be smart and choose EVs over 
the natural vehicles.

above discipline use this method to plan a construction project. The field team discarded the plan formulated using 
CPM because it is a paradox. The paradox is caused by the inability of the field team to adhere to the construction 
plan made by the upper management using the CPM. It is also the formal plan in the field of construction 
management and many government agencies perquisite CPM application for completing the project to disburse 
the first payment to the company. The CPM is cut short by on-site /work management plans which are short-term 
in nature to complete the project at hand. Investigation for the potential drawbacks and their reasons should be 
done to increase the reliability and thus the efficiency of CPM. The investigation involves the study of Action 
Theory which helps in finding out the reasons behind the failure of CPM in completing the project on time 
parallelly reducing the project cost. Deliberative Action Theory, a type of action theory, is typically used in the 
development of a project plan which requires planning each project activity by the project manager which is a 
drawback as proved by the Situated Action Theory. The investigation is supported by visualizing a hypothetical 
scenario that showcases that the application of the Critical Path Method to complete the project on time is 
ineffective. It takes an example of a Construction Company which uses CPM to develop a project plan such that 
the project is completed on time. Based on the investigation hypothesis, some potential improvements for the 
effective and efficient application of CPM are suggested. The suggestion is supported by a case study that takes 
an example of a furniture manufacturing company that utilizes CPM and PERT to develop a project plan to 
complete the project on time and at the same time reduce the project costs.

1. Introduction
Project Management involves planning, scheduling, monitoring, and controlling the different project activities in 
such a way that the project is completed on time and within the assigned budget. The critical factor in the project 
completion is completing the project by utilizing an optimal cost-time trade-off. Cost and time required for 
completing a projected increase by an increase in the complexity of the project. This causes the company to shed 
more money and other resources such as labor to complete the project. A cost overrun in form of lost resources 
may cause a huge loss to the company.  
Project Management offers some useful techniques to determine the optimal cost-time balance so that the 
project is completed within the stipulated time and budget (Agyei, 2015; Atin & Lubis, 2019; Göksu, 2017).  
This makes the work easy and efficient for the Project Managers assigned to the project thereby reducing the 
foreseeable losses (if any) that the company could have borne if the project had gone awry. These techniques are 
namely, 
a)
Critical Path Method (CPM)
b)
Project Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)
In this context, the focus would be on the implementation of the CPM. Both CPM and PERT are network models
used to link different project activities directly or indirectly by employing logic or relevant technology required
to link the activities. These methods thus help monitor and control the project activities. They also help determine
a slack time for different activities involved in the project so that the project gets completed on time within the
assigned budget. They do so by identifying the critical activities of the project through the network diagram which
links the project activities logically. The identification becomes important because if the critical activities are

In the research study, the data is directly collected from an interview with an expert team of a Furniture Company. 
In processing, the data quantitative as well as qualitative data have been applied and the quantitative study used 
findings from the qualitative study to explain/interpret quantitative data. (Göksu, 2017) 
 
5.3 Research Question 
How will the implementation of CPM and PERT influence the effectiveness and efficiency of the furniture 
company ''Dallas''? Is the question to which the research paper is seeking an answer? (Göksu, 2017) 
 
5.4 Problem Defining 
Six items from various product lines have been chosen to address the research issue. The time and cost of every 
activity in the production process must be presented in a table to identify the ""critical route,"" project length, and 
cumulative project expenses for all of these items. The results should demonstrate how these methods significantly 
shorten the project's completion time. All findings will be compared to the company's historical data. (Göksu, 
2017)  
 
5.5 Results 
The project completion time of Dallas's furniture company is significantly shortened by CPM and PERT. The 
study's final findings are anticipated to aid everyone—individuals and businesses alike—in better comprehending 
how CPM and PERT methodologies can cut down on project completion costs and time. As anticipated, the 
quantitative findings highlight the significance of using those techniques while planning, scheduling, and 
managing a project to maximize the efficacy and efficiency of a furniture company. The same procedure was 
carried out on six chosen items, and the results revealed that these strategies significantly shorten the project's 
completion time. (Göksu, 2017) 
 
6.  Conclusion  
CPM follows the Deliberative Action Theory because the project is simulated beforehand by the project manager. 
The problems on the way while using CPM are mentioned above in the overview of the CPM. The main problem 
is the repeated updating of the network diagram by the on-field management team to factor in the real changes in 
the network diagram. This is explained by the usage of the above-mentioned action theory in carrying out project 
planning. (Göksu, 2017; Senior, n.d.) 
 
The gap between planning and the ground reality is filled by updating the inputs (activities) to the plan. It comes 
to notice that updating is not a simple task. It involves a huge opportunity cost in terms of time (man-months) and 
money to carry out the updating and also finishing the project on time. This cannot be afforded by the client as 
well as the project manager. (Göksu, 2017; Senior, n.d.) 
The role of plans and instruction are both pre-decided by the project manager and is proven by the deliberative 
action theory. A good manager always set out eccentric to the plan and completes the project within the established 
time limits because he/she knows that perfectly follow of the plan and instructions is not possible because of a 
difference between the planned project environment and the ground reality. The project manager has also the 
burden of going awry and not finishing the project, in such cases, the manager has to introspect on his planning 
and change it accordingly so that future managers don't make such mistakes again. (Göksu, 2017; Senior, n.d.) 
Also, the nature of the world is hostile that is dynamic in nature preplanning is judged and is often termed as an 
absurd thing to do at the expense of resources and time. (Göksu, 2017; Senior, n.d.)

Abstract 
There are various challenges which come in the way of successful project management. The success of any project is 
defined by how all challenges faced are dealt with. The challenges can even turn into opportunities with proper 
management and planning. Project management is the implementation of specific knowledge, skills, tools, and 
procedures to achieve the desired project goals. There are five stages for the successful management of the project. 
This paper presents the major challenges faced in the project management’s step one- Project Initiation. The project 
initiation phase broadly defines the project goals. Organization comes up with many ideas through brainstorming and 
then through proper planning ideas are turned into concrete goals for which the whole plan is built up. Once the goal 
is set, stake holders are defined. There are many challenges faced even at the first stage. The few challenges are 
thoroughly explained in the paper. The major challenges faced during the project initiation stage are assignment of 
authority, list of task assignment, project cost planning, prioritizing goals and stakeholders list and their expectations. 
All are to be properly dealt with, else the success of the project is at risk. Few research papers are critically reviewed 
to support the arguments stated. One talks about the “Critical Issues Related to Metro Rail Projects in India '' which 
specifically talks about the metro rail corridor in Delhi. It evaluated the challenges faced by the project manager during 
the initiation phase of the metro rail project in Delhi. The other is about the “Automobile Manufacturing Industry” 
where the automobile manufacturing industry in India is discussed. It covers the various challenges faced during the 
setup of a manufacturing plant. These both papers also illustrate the solutions to the problems faced.

1.Introduction
Project management is one of the most crucial keys to the success of project development and completion. Any 
project's work may be divided into stages, each of which has a set of related activities and builds toward a significant 
deliverable, making it easier to plan for and manage. Once a project milestone is reached at the conclusion of each 
stage, the stage is considered to have been successfully completed. So, project management is categorized into five 
stages which are mentioned below in the Figure 1: 
2561","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022

3.2.7 Environmental Clearance 
Another important thing is to keep up with the pollution control norms and keep the emissions under control according 
to the mentioned standard. If the Automobile Manufacturing Plant is not maintaining the emission levels, then the 
Project Manager should inform the environmental emission department regarding the emissions level and they should 
control it. The Project Manager should regularly keep a check on the emissions level and be updated about the level 
of emissions (Rathi, 2021).  
4. Conclusion
The life cycle of project management is broken down into five stages. Project initiation is the most critical and foremost 
stage in project management. The process of project initiation is very important. It will determine the success or failure 
of the project. A recent study revealed that there are five main challenges in project initiation. Know who has the 
authority or right to have decision-making power over your project. Also, make sure to create a list of all the people 
involved in this project. With each project, you'll need to identify the project's budget.  Next, you must think about 
who will be affected by this project as a whole. Find out what their needs are, what they want, and what problems 
they're facing. A successful project is one where all the challenges faced are duly taken care of.  
Over here as you can see, we took one example of the Delhi metro rail project. Now as we discussed, project 
management has main five aspects like project initiation, project planning, project execution, project monitoring and 
control and last is project closure. The project initiation phase is the most crucial phase of any project management. 
Because successful completion of the project entirely depends on the project initiation phase, if the project manager 
makes a mistake in the project initiation phase the entire project is affected due to the same. Over here in this review, 
we assessed the challenges that occur in the project initiation phase of the metro line project in Delhi. Also mentioned 
the types of challenges that occurred and various solutions taken by the project manager. 
Project management turns out to be one of the most crucial aspects of any industry. Lack of management skills and 
incapability in implementing all the individual steps will lead to a decline in production and eventually closure of the 
plant. An elaborate study was conducted and five to six similar kinds of case studies were analyzed to obtain the 
details presented. All the steps from land acquisition to environmental clearance need to be followed for the successful 
implementation of any plant. All these build a foundation on which the future of that particular industry relies. Thus, 
it can be concluded that by observing all the associated norms and consistently following all the required steps, one 
can expect the establishment and initiation of an industry with a strong ground hold.

Abstract 
Cloud computing is applied in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) by dispersing large-scale computations across 
multiple distributed resources. Cloud computing task scheduling has been a long-standing issue in ascertaining the 
quality, accessibility, accuracy, and capability of WSNs. In order to achieve a well-organized solution to the bi-
objective time-constrained task scheduling problem, the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) has 
been developed. Additionally, The NSGA-II addresses the problem of task scheduling by experimenting. The study 
results demonstrate that NSGA-II can successfully achieve this study's objective.

Abstract 
Base intuition tells us that if you don’t keep practicing a given skill set, it will continue to degrade the longer it goes 
unused. What does this mean for a skill set that only gets used infrequently? How can one be assured that when they 
need their skills, that they will be in a state that is reliable? This point becomes even more important when the skills 
set belongs to a technically skilled worker, within a maintenance facility. Not only does this affect the quality of the 
work produced, but also the time taken to perform the task. In this study, learning curve theory is applied to the 
workforce of a military maintenance facility to firstly, identify the changes to job task time that can be expected due 
to knowledge and skill degradation, and secondly, to determine training intervention types that address the loss of 
knowledge and/or skill. Through the use of computational experimentation based on Discrete Event Simulation 
maintenance model output, it was observed that without refresher training intervention, job completion times increased 
between 14% and 27%. With intervention applied, this increase in completion time can be reduced and maintained at 
levels as low as 4.14%.

1. Introduction
A key measure of a maintenance facility’s performance is its ability to adhere to specified task durations, thereby 
completing a designated amount of maintenance over a given period and thereby maximizing asset availability. This 
is especially important in Australian Defence Force (ADF) maintenance facilities, as capability system availability is 
directly tied to the organisation’s ability to deliver the service required. Whilst much effort has been applied to the 
analysis and enhancement of performance in this space, there is a lack of research investigating an individual 
technician’s output - research has focused on factors which effect the facility as a whole, e.g., supply chain issues, 
(L¨ofsten, 1998, Safaei et al. 2011, de Jonge and Scarf, 2019), Hamimi, Razak et al. 2011). This report attempts to 
analyse the variances in individual performance. 
ADF maintenance facilities do not differ greatly from their civilian counterparts. The most significant difference is 
the routine high turnover of the workforce due to posting cycles. In this research, the modelled maintenance workforce 
is that of an unguided weapon maintenance facility employing both ADF and civilian personnel. Effort has been made 
to maintain a generic approach in the modelling so that the results are useful to maintenance facilities supporting a 
wide range of equipment. More detail on the workforce and data pool will be provided in Methodology Section. 
To analyse the performance of the individual, one must have a proven mathematical means of determining how an 
individual learns and forgets. Learning Curve (LC) modelling, initially developed in “Factors affecting the cost of 
airplanes” (Wright, 1936), provides us such a model. LCs have become a verified means of modelling learning and 
forgetting in fields such as medicine, sports, and software development. This methodology will be adapted in this 
research to determine the technician’s task completion time and therefore the maintenance facility’s output.

Abstract 
Dry granulate or powder material is transported using the pneumatic conveying of particles engineering method. 
Adriano's doctoral dissertation's goal is to propose a modeling framework for optimizing pneumatic conveying 
systems' energy efficiency while taking into account the unique bulk properties of the product being transported. The 
foundation of this study is the technical optimisation of a workflow using information from an industrial operation 
that is controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) that executes logical, sequential, and timed activities for 
plant control. In order to connect with the process operator through a graphical environment interface, the PLC 
interfaces with a Human-Machine Interface and a Supervision and Control System. It has been demonstrated on an 
industrial scale that it is possible to control a conveying system using only two input parameters by using mathematics 
to develop a systematic technique to choose the gas (air) pressure and flow required to operate a pneumatic conveying 
system in dense phase. As a result, OPEX is decreased while still operating at predetermined conveying rates with 
less electricity used. This study applies a methodical modeling technique to optimize energy efficiency in order to 
lower operational expenditure (OPEX). Since pneumatic conveyance relies heavily on actual data, general models are 
challenging to develop. These restrictions mean that measuring energy efficiency is typically restricted to a particular 
experimental set of circumstances. This approach can be modified to increase the energy effectiveness of other kinds 
of systems for pneumatic conveying.

Abstract 
This paper presents the design and implementation of a smart transducer system for electrical cabinet equipment theft. 
The system consists of a sound sensor module, an ultrasonic distance sensor element and an ATMega328p micro-
controller. The solution was designed to operate in a zone 2 hazard area. The raw sound sensor output signal was 
preprocessed using appropriate signal transformations. The prototype was tested on HUAWEI's 5G 
Telecommunications cabinet, connected to an SMU on the rectifier via USB for main power. Alarms are displayed on 
HUAWEI'S NetEco site energy monitoring software noise threshold and/or door movement detected. This solution 
can easily integrate to any IoT system with minimal or no modifications.  A low cost, low power consumption, real-
time, high accuracy solution was realised. The prototype implemented achieves an average response time of 4 over 6 
samples.

1. Introduction
According to Smith (2004). Electricity theft within the power distribution network mainly takes place in two ways, 
by bypassing the energy meter and by hooking of the energy line, This paper focusses of electricity equipment theft 
in enclosed areas such as electrical and network cabinets. Enclosed electrical equipment such battery modules and 
energy meters can be secured from theft and tempering.  
In South Africa and most countries around the globe cabinet intuition is illegal according to Eskom Holdings SOC 
Ltd (2022). This crime leads to: 
•
Removal of the energy meters and other vital electrical equipment.
•
Illegal connections.
•
Vandalism and
•
Tempering of the energy meters.

The product developed consists of sensitive electronic devices, these devices are sensitive when exposed to mechanical 
harm and humidity. Development of and intrinsically safe encapsulation may extend the operation lifetime of the 
product. For this investigation it is enough that the product will rely on the intrinsic safety the cabinet. 
 
The system’s static characteristic temperature is the limiting property of the solution. The Arduino, ATMega328p, 
currently has a maximum operating temperature of 85°C.  However, the microphone and the ultrasonic sensor detector 
have a maximum operating temperature of 40°C. Therefore, this limits the system to function in environments with 
temperatures below 40°C. More temperature resilient components should be investigated later.   
 
An electronic relay is an electromechanical device that is used a switch. This device consists of multiple contacts input 
terminal and multiple contact output terminals. Configured as Normally Closed (NC) or Normally Open (NO) upon 
coil energization. Multiple input-output contacts would help the solution in terms of scalability as well as efficient 
logical programming. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper presented the development of a custom smart transducer system for electrical cabinet equipment theft. The 
system consists of a sound sensor module, an ultrasonic distance sensor element and an ATMega328p micro-
controller. The solution was designed to operate in a zone 2 hazard area. The raw sound sensor output signal was 
preprocessed using appropriate signal transformations. Testing results and critical analysis were documented. The 
prototype was tested on HUAWEI's 5G Telecommunications cabinet, connected to an SMU on the rectifier via USB 
for main power. Alarms are displayed on HUAWEI'S NetEco site energy monitoring software noise threshold and/or 
door movement detected. This solution can easily integrate to any IoT system with minimal or no modifications.  A 
power efficient low cost, real-time, high accuracy solution was realised. The prototype implemented achieves an 
average response time of 4s over 6 samples, with an operating range of 64 dBA to 120 dBA.

Abstract 
 Construction projects have high complexity in nature, especially construction work during the renovation or any 
addition to existing structures. Managing techniques during construction projects have not been transformed 
considerably over the last few decades. More than 80% of construction projects do not meet deadlines. This is due to 
multiple reasons including but not limited to some inherited nature of project management techniques. Fixed project 
scope is also a drawback of traditional project management. In addition, user requirements with respect to lightweight 
construction, structures, and architectural designs have significantly evolved over the same period. Therefore, an 
amplified gap has been observed between the current managerial project understanding and project operations along 
with its execution. Although, all the industries including construction engineering have learned from past experiences 
and have created frameworks for project implementation. The construction sector has been lagging in proper 
implementation as compared to other areas like Information Technology, Pharmaceutical, and the mechanical design 
industry. With recently established frameworks at hand, the construction industry has improved its competitiveness in 
the market. However, the comprehensive, and absolute implementation of a fully integrated approach is still not on-
par. Due to this reason, a vast disparity has been noticed between client demands and project executions. This study 
investigates the implementation of an agile framework as a major requirement in the construction industry. The 
application of agile management has been analyzed through the evaluation of its impact on existing projects. The 
present research explores the following possibilities: Can agile management be implemented at various stages in the 
construction industry, particularly during the renovation phase of existing structures? What adaptations are necessary 
to use agile methodology in the understanding of process workflow during a new project, or renovation of an existing 
and operational building? How could agile or its parts be implemented during the design and planning phase of the 
renovation project to create proper deliverance? When agile could be implemented for multi-department efficiency 
improvement for renovation projects framework? How can agile management be integrated with upstream or 
downstream activities to improve project schedules? The results from this study revealed that agile methodology has 
great potential in the construction industry, whether it be implemented on newly proposed projects or renovation

projects. From this case study, improvements and fragility of the implementation and its artifacts have been identified 
in one of the extremely crucial renovation projects. In conclusion, the analysis presents various recommendations 
about the application and implementation of agile methodology encompassing several divisions within a construction 
corporation. This investigation also provides a practical outlook that facilitates an understanding of the advantageous 
implementation of agile methodology within individual phases of restoration and future construction projects.

Abstract 
In today's globally integrated and interconnected industry, supply chain management (SCM) has demonstrated a vital 
aspect of strategies for all enterprises, regardless of size or area. The supply chain is a crucial component of 
organizational operations, and efficient administration of it will result in a strategic edge. This is true not only for 
major corporations yet moreover for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The presence of supply chain 
concerns may result in inefficiencies, which may ultimately hamper future corporate growth. This research looks at 
SCM difficulties and how effective it is in overcoming them in small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises 
(SMEs) in South Africa (SA). Amongst widely known problems encountered by SA manufacturing SME firms are 
stockpile concerns, customer support, organizational factors, information management concerns and goods or delivery 
stream concerns.  
Aim – This study aims to analyze the knowledge of supply chain management (SCM) practices in small and medium-
sized firms (SMEs). The anchor of this research is to discover supply chain complexities faced by SMEs in the South 
African manufacturing sector and to assess the intensity of every concern. For this initial investigation, surveys were 
done with a manufacturing firm located in Johannesburg, a metropolitan city in SA. 
Methodology – This paper offers a literature-based study to explore SCM difficulties for manufacturing SMEs. The 
literature was based on a careful examination of various research publications from high-quality worldwide journal 
articles—primary data were collected through a questionnaire filled out by 49 employees from the manufacturing firm 
in Johannesburg. Thus, the study used a case study approach with a quantitative analysis approach. In addition, 
company visits were also conducted for observation purposes. The survey instrument's main variables include motives, 
impediments, prioritized investments, procurement strategies, and effectiveness. 
Results: The results suggest that the company has a clear channel of SCM which is very good. In addition, the 
management and floor level employees are familiar with SCM practices, even though some are more used and valued 
than others. Results showed that a good link between the supply chain concept and the company's logistics operations 
is essential for a good SCM.

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem statement 
 According to Kalidas et al. (2020), SMEs account for 82% of South African overall business establishments because 
of the small size of regional markets and the concentration of markets; SMEs need to enter a new call to globalize 
their business in other words. Technological advances and decreasing barriers to trade not only give large corporations 
the opportunity but also allow SMEs to become more international, faster and more productive. Good supply chain 
strategies are needed to enter new markets, particularly across borders. Companies of various kinds have enormous 
prospects for success in a globalized economy (Frederico et al., 2019). Yet, because of multiple assets, skillset and

Table 2 above shows the respondent's perspective on the SCM practice factors (practices) that the company can adopt 
to improve the SCM department. Ranked from the most suggested factor to the latest, most respondents believe there 
is a good link between the supply chain concept and the company's logistics operations. Some other respondents also 
believe that modern information processes are absent within the company. However, only a few respondents believe 
that collaborations help the company accelerate product creation and technological advancement.

Most employees believe that the company's predictions about product demand are generally precise, as it allows better 
management of the supply chain and coordination of activities. They also think the company must know where vendors 
and clients are located. However, only a few employees believe that the company's long-term relationship with its 
clients is long-term. Literature suggests that long-term relationships between a company and its suppliers are essential 
to business growth and even the quality of products. 
 
 
5. Conclusion and future research 
An adequate supply chain system is essential if small and medium size enterprises would like to grow their operations 
throughout international boundaries. As mentioned in the literature study, past research reveals that supply chain 
problems or concerns may impede company development. As a result, this research intended to determine what supply 
chain practices are presently used in manufacturing SMEs in South Africa. The paper investigated the current literature 
on SCM practices and difficulties confronting SA manufacturing SMEs. The study brought together disparate 
perspectives on SCM practice in manufacturing SMEs. The current status of the literature reveals commitments to 
implementing SCM strategies in manufacturing organizations. A significant portion of the research has concentrated 
on the usage or deployment of IT solutions in SMEs. The results suggest that the company has a clear channel of SCM 
which is very good. In addition, the management and floor-level employees are familiar with SCM practices, even 
though some are more used and valued than others. Results showed that a good link between the supply chain concept 
and the company's logistics operations is essential for a good SCM.

Abstract 
The manufacturing model developed in the third industrial revolution is going through a disruption process that will 
permanently change the way goods will be designed, manufactured and delivered to consumers. The fourth industrial 
revolution or Industry 4.0 rises from two main factors: (i) the demands of a rising portion of consumers who are highly 
connected, whose hyper customized and immediate consumption patterns tend to favor services despite products, and 
(ii) the breakthrough of digital technologies that permeate various segments of the modern society. For this new
industrial paradigm, the purpose is to merge physical and virtual worlds, building environments where data and
information will become the great assets of business models and human intervention in the manufacturing process
will be even lesser than what's envisioned for the third industrial revolution. However, bringing this concept into
reality is not trivial and there is a need for extensive planning of the physical, technological, and organizational
transformations that will be needed to achieve its goals. In this work, two aspects of the manufacturing industry's
digitalization process will be exploited: its technical requirements and the demanded strategic competencies. In the
technical sphere, there is a range of technologies generally considered by the literature as the backbone of Industry
4.0. Through exploratory research, these technologies will be evaluated, and their characteristics analyzed to identify
how they interact with one another and if there are dependencies among them, determining an implementation
roadmap that is technically coherent. Within the strategic purview, the competencies enabled by these technologies
will be associated with the competencies elected by the German Academy of Science and Engineering on its Industry
4.0 Maturity Index (SCHUH, GÜNTHER et al., 2020) as necessary to reach this new model's strategic goals. Once
determining the technical and strategic interactions between the selected technologies, this work proposes a systemic
roadmap for the implementation of Industry 4.0 enabling technologies that defines a path for the digitization process
of the manufacturing industry.

1. Introduction
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is a widely spread concept among different industries: manufacturing, services, 
construction, education, etc., and its development is related to the changes in consumer needs all over the world. 
Following its predecessors (First, Second, and Third Industrial Revolutions), the also known as Industry 4.0 rises as a 
response to today’s consumption patterns, where industries must respond quickly to requests for highly customizable, 
environmentally friendly, and cost-effective products (KELLER et al., 2014; KHALID et al., 2017; RÜSSMANN, 
2015). For the manufacturing industries, the challenge starts as early as during the product's idealization: how is it 
possible to constantly add compelling features to already well-established products? Furthermore, how to create means 
2606","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022

that the implementation of these technologies has generated, if not individually, in the general context of the level. 
This assessment is an important decision-making tool, as it will indicate whether the performance of the implemented 
technologies is positive and whether the competencies from a strategic point of view have been achieved, thus 
indicating whether the company is prepared to advance to higher levels. 
Figure 4. Simplified technical correlations between the enabling technologies 
5 Conclusion 
This work aimed to investigate the relationship between the technologies associated with Industry 4.0 and the strategic 
competencies that an industry in compliance with it must display. A set of eleven technologies was identified, among 
the ones appointed by authors both in the academic and corporate spheres and were considered as the enablers of this 
new model. It was also observed that most of these technologies have technical interdependencies, which naturally 
imposes a logical order of implementation. As for the strategic competencies, the ACATECH model of industry 
maturity assessment was used as a basis for relating the functionalities provided by each technology to the 
competencies expected in each of the maturity levels. The study accomplishes its objective of establishing a systemic 
roadmap for the implementation of the Industry 4.0 enabling technologies, however, there are considerations that 
should be made about its context. The model considers that the industry at issue should be at the highest level of 
maturity regarding the Third Industrial Revolution, no technical requirements were established prior to the first level 
of maturity for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Also, the model’s adherence should be tested on a concrete case to 
confirm whether the theoretical inferences made are applicable.

Abstract 
The aim of this work is to analyze how racial diversity groups are structured within several Brazilian’s companies. 
For this, the quantitative research methods building blocks and the indicators from the initiative of the Center for 
Studies on Work Relations and Inequalities (CEERT) of the Ethos Institute and of the Institute for Human Rights and 
Business (IHRB) were used. A Racial Diversity Indicator and ScrumBan methodology were developed to assist in 
managing racial diversity in companies. Due to the fact of the 155 responses obtained through an online form, 60% 
responded that they had no black employees, and about 71% of the participants reported that there were no objective 
strategies for increasing black professionals in companies. Although there is an increase in the diversity management 
agenda among different sectors of society, the survey results show that 90% of respondents report that there are no 
career plans, goals or quotas to reverse the current data related to the lack of black professionals and black women in 
their organizations. Furthermore 56% or about 120 million people—are Afro-Brazilian, making the country home to 
the largest Black population in the Americas.

1. Introduction
Faced with the imperative of facing intolerable social inequalities, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) (2017) considers the need for government leaders, business leaders and 
representatives of civil society to definitively understand that, in order to building a fair and competitive nation at all 
levels, it is necessary to invest in human development, as well as contribute to the development of the black population 
to overcome structural racism, and increase qualitative access to health, housing, work, education and culture. 
Moreira (2019) reports that the way human groups are presented will determine what values are attributed to them, 
and thus, how their cultural and material relevance will be. This condition will imply how social interactions will be 
carried out and what professional possibilities will be. The understanding of racism as a political and historical process 
is fundamental, as it constitutes a construction of subjectivities of individuals about how conscience and affections are 
somehow interrelated with social practices (Almeida, 2018).

4. Conclusions 
From this study, it can be concluded that there is a misconception when talking about racial diversity, that is, people 
who consider themselves white do not feel that they belong to a racialized group, and thus, do not discuss training 
involving racial issues. 
 
A relevant data in this study is about 55.40% (89 of the total of 155 participants in the survey) reported that their 
Institutions are diverse and 69.70% (108 people) believe that diversity is positive for organizations. In contrast, 
30.30% (47 people) do not consider racial diversity important in their institution. 
2625","Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Sydney, Australia, December 20-21, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
Only 32.90% (51 people) point out the existence of a racial diversity group in their company and a worrying fact is 
that 70% of the companies that have a racial diversity group do not contain objective strategies for the insertion of 
more black people in the Institution, which contributes to the fact that 94.63% and 95.97% did not have career plans 
and goals to increase the number of black people in management positions in their Institutions, respectively. 
 
With this, it is observed that although there is an increase in exposures in the media about the increase in diversity 
policies or programs in the Institutions, this is not reflected in the effectiveness of the concept of equity for the black 
population in the corporate world. And with that, the urgent need for more Programs related to social inclusion and 
racial equity is suggested, which can be implemented using the Racial Diversity Indicator and the ScrumBam 
methodology developed for this purpose.

implementation by established standards and codes of ethics. Services in the health field will always be needed by the 
community and will always develop in a better direction. One of the areas of service that is the community need is 
health. The more advanced the renewal in the field of technology, the more services in the field of health also progress 
in modern facilities and infrastructure and become more accurate. This research aims to analyze the influence of 
facilities and employee competencies on patient waiting for lengths through the quality of service at the Outpatient 
Installation of K.H. Hayyung Hospital, Selayar Islands Regency. The research was designed in the form of survey 
research. The population in this study were all patients treated at K.H. Hayyung Hospital, Selayar Islands Regency,

1. Introduction
The hospital has a mission to provide quality and affordable health services to the community to improve public health, 
including having competent human resources, adequate facilities, and fast patient waiting times. The quality of health 
services is interpreted as the level of health service opportunities. On the one hand, it can cause satisfaction in each 
patient to the satisfaction of the average population. On the other hand, the procedures for its implementation by the 
standards and codes of ethics have been established. The more advanced the renewal in the field of technology, the 
more services in the field of health also progress in modern facilities and infrastructure and become more accurate. 
Waiting times are an important component of hospital service and are the first gateway that plays an important role in 
providing a good first impression for patients. According to the Hospital Minimum Service Standard, the length of 
waiting time in outpatient installations is from the time the patient registers until served by a doctor (KEPMENKES,

6. Conclusion  
Employee facilities and competencies positively affect patient waiting time through the quality of service at the 
Outpatient Installation of K.H. Hayyung Hospital, Selayar Islands Regency. In addition to facilities, the increase in 
patient waiting time at the Outpatient Installation is also influenced by the competence of employees because 
employee competence is the ability and characteristics possessed by an employee in the form of knowledge, expertise, 
and behavioral attitudes needed for the implementation of their job duties. Then the importance of quality of service 
to increase the waiting period of patients at the Outpatient Installation of K.H. Hayyung Hospital Selayar Islands 
Regency because the quality of service is the conformity between the expected service from the hospital (expected 
service) with the services received or perceived (perceived service) by the patient or the perceived results. Thus, health 
facilities are needed to shorten the patient's waiting period at the Outpatient Installation of K.H. Hayyung Hospital. It 
can improve the means to launch and facilitate the implementation of facility functions to provide convenience to 
customers in carrying out their activities so that customer needs can be met.

Abstract 
People need services to meet a wide variety of needs that cannot be met by themselves. This research aims to measure 
and analyze the influence of facilities and competencies and quality of public services on community satisfaction, 
both directly and indirectly. One of the government offices whose activities provide public services to the community 
is Bontoala District, Makassar City, South Sulawesi Province. This research is designed in the form of quantitative 
research. The population in this study is the entire family card (KK) in the Bontoala Subdistrict of Makassar City. 
Nonprobability sampling techniques carry out sample determination. Based on data from BPS Makassar City (2019), 
the population of Bontoala District reached 57,197 people from 12,296 households. This number is divided into 12 
villages, 240 ORTs, and 56 ORW. Because the population is quite large, the formula Slovin (Umar, 2009) is used; the 
minimum sample number studied is 100 respondents with family cards to be examined. This research was conducted 
on the community in the Bontoala District of Makassar City, as many as 100 people. The method used in this study is 
probability sampling, which is axial sampling using formula solving. The data collected with the questionnaire is then 
analyzed by the Path Analysis method using the SPSS 23 application. Result: This research method is quantitative. At 
the same time, the hypothesis test uses the t-test to test the direct influence and indirect influence of facility variables 
employee competence on public satisfaction through the quality of public services using the Sobel test. Based on this 
study, it can be concluded that the facility affects community satisfaction. It means that the better the facilities 
available, the more facilities available, and the community will also feel comfortable and satisfied with the facilities. 
The additional community and employees will feel happy and satisfied with the facilities available. Competence also 
affects community satisfaction, meaning that the better the competence possessed by the employee, especially in 
carrying out his duties, namely serving the community, the community will feel happy with the services provided by 
the employee. Then for mediation tests conducted, it was found that the quality of public services affected public 
satisfaction.

1. Introduction
People need services to meet various needs that cannot be met by themselves. The form of services provided is related 
to population administration and other services related to the government at the sub-district level. One of the 
government offices whose activities provide public services to the community is Bontoala District, Makassar City, 
South Sulawesi Province. Bontoala District is one of the 15 sub-districts in Makassar City. Bontoala District has an 
area of 2.10 Km² consisting of 12 villages, namely: Gaddong Village, Wajo Baru Village, Tompo Balang Village, 
New Malimongan Village, Lompoa Village, Baraya Village, Bontoala Village, Bontoala Parang Village, Old Bontoala 
Village, Ejaya Flower Village, Kite Village, and Parang Kite Village. With the number of RW 57 and RT 257. 
The primary purpose of public service is public satisfaction. Community satisfaction is the main factor that pulik 
service providers must observe because community satisfaction will determine the government's success in organizing

Based on the research results on hypothesis 2, there is a positive and significant influence between employee 
competency variables on the quality of public services in the Bontoala District of Makassar City. This research aligns 
with (Yusriadi, 2021) with the title The Influence of Employee Competence on The Quality of Public Services in the 
Service Branch of the West Java Provincial Revenue Office Subang regency"".  
 
Based on the research results on hypothesis 3, there is a positive and significant influence between the variables of the 
quality of public services on community satisfaction in the Bontoala District of Makassar City. ""This research is in 
line with research by (Rumkel et al., 2019) with the title The Influence of Public Service Quality on Public Satisfaction 
in Electronic ID Card Ownership in Cempaka Baru Village"". ""This research is also in line with research by (Darwis, 
2012) entitled Analysis of the Influence of Public Service Quality on Public Satisfaction Study on Electronic Identity 
Card Recording Services (e-KTP) in Depok City"".  
 
Based on the research results on hypothesis 4, there is a positive and significant influence between facility variables 
on community satisfaction in the Bontoala District of Makassar City. This research aligns with (Tamsah et al., 2021) 
research on the influence of quality of service and facilities on community satisfaction studies in Sambirejo Village, 
Semarang. Also, Amanto et al. (2019) research on the quality of services, facilities, and prices affect service user 
satisfaction at Samsat Manado Office. 
 
Based on the research results on hypothesis 5, there is a positive and significant influence between competency 
variables on community satisfaction in the Bontoala District of Makassar City. This research aligns with Schultze & 
Orlikowski (2004)on the influence of non-medical employee competencies on community satisfaction levels at Arifin 
Achmad Pekanbaru Hospital. Also, Lederman (2020) with the title Of Influence of Competence, Commitment, 
Performance, and Quality of Service to The Satisfaction of the People of KTP-ell Applicants in Bandar District, Batang 
Regency"".  
 
Thus hypothesis 6, which states that facilities affect community satisfaction through the quality of public services in 
the Bontoala Subdistrict of Makassar City, is accepted. It shows that if the facilities in the office are inadequate, it can 
affect the quality of public services so that general satisfaction will also not be good, and vice versa; if the facilities in 
the office are adequate, the community will also feel satisfied and comfortable with the existing facilities. This research 
is in line with research conducted by Nusran et al. (2018) aimed to find out the variables of location and facilities both 
directly and indirectly through the quality of service as intervening to customer satisfaction. 
 
Thus, hypothesis 7, which states that competence significantly affects community satisfaction through the quality of 
public services in the Bontoala District of Makassar City, is rejected or not accepted. This case shows that it must be 
done to improve the quality of service first by meeting service competencies to show community satisfaction. 
Employee competence as a dimension of service quality becomes a factor that affects the good or bad quality of service 
and the final process that will determine the assessment of satisfaction felt by the service user community. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Then for mediation tests conducted, it was found that the quality of public services affected public satisfaction. Based 
on this research, the facility affects community satisfaction. It means that the better the facilities available, the more 
facilities available, the community will also feel comfortable and satisfied with the facilities. The community and 
employees will feel happy and satisfied with the facilities available. Competence also affects community satisfaction, 
meaning that the better the competence possessed by the employee, especially in carrying out his duties, namely 
serving the community, the community will feel happy with the services provided by the employee.

Abstract 
This study aims to elaborate on and analyze the Influence of Health Workers' Capabilities on Basic Immunization 
Incompleteness through Health Promotion Performance and Parental Knowledge in the Durikumba Public Health 
Center Work Area of Central Mamuju Regency. This research was conducted at the Durikumba Public Health Center 
in Central Mamuju Regency, which lasted for approximately 2 (two) months, from July to August 2020. Use causal 
design with a quantitative approach. The population in this study is all heads of families who have toddlers in the 
Durikumba Public Health Center Work Area of Korossa Mamuju Tengah District, which is 261 households. In this 
study, the sampling technique was carried out using the purposive sampling technique. The sample criteria were 
toddlers under three years; the final sample successfully obtained was 150 people. Data collection techniques were 
carried out through observation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, with data analysis techniques using 
path analysis. The results showed that the capability of health workers is a trigger that encourages the improvement 
of the degree of health of toddlers with increased health promotion; health workers take proactive measures to support 
the implementation of health promotion functions fully. The spirit of community participation and empowerment is a 
factor that maximizes the function of health promotion performance and impacts the high level of community 
compliance to carry out complete basic immunizations for their babies. In addition, the capabilities of health workers 
also encourage the improvement of parental knowledge. Negative influences are shown on the relationship between 
officer capability, health promotion performance, and parental knowledge of the incompleteness of basic 
immunizations. The study's contribution was to create a pattern of negative relationships on variables, to show that 
not all health promotion measures are taken, and knowledge elsewhere can reflect sensitivity in providing or 
supplementing the complete immunization of their babies.

1. Introduction
The public health center is a health service that interacts directly with the community. It is comprehensive in its 
activities, including promotive, preventive, curative, and rehabilitative efforts. According to Mastulen et al. (2021), a 
public health center is a technical unit responsible for organizing health development in one or part of the sub-district 
area. Qualified health workers can carry out their tasks and functions better, providing optimal curative action and 
encouraging more preventive efforts.  
Routine immunization is an immunization activity carried out continuously according to schedule. In Indonesia, 
complete basic immunization coverage in infants in the last three years has increased, namely in 2016, reaching 77.1%, 
2017 (78.6%), and 2018 (83.5%). Although there has been an increase, the achievements in the last three years have 
still not reached the target that has been set at 100% according to the Minimum Service Standard Firman et al. (2020).

Center; health workers take proactive measures to support the implementation of health promotion functions fully; 
The capabilities of health workers also encourage the improvement of parental knowledge. People can feel facilitated 
in conducting coaching, communication, and supervision of their family members, parents who have toddlers to carry 
out complete basic immunizations and understanding the importance of maintaining health for all family members; 
The negative influence is shown in the relationship between health promotion performance and parents' knowledge of 
essential immunization incompleteness. The Durikumba Public Health Center's performance of promotions is more 
proactive to support its work program to complete UCI (Universal Child Immunization) once better parental 
knowledge has resulted in better infant immunization patterns; The contribution of this study is to try to create a 
pattern of negative relationships on variables to show that not all health promotion measures are taken. Also, parents' 
knowledge elsewhere can reflect the sensitivity to provide or complete immunization for their babies.

1. Introduction
Competition between companies currently is getting tighter, so companies are required to be able to compete and 
survive with their competitors. HR has an important role in a company because it is the most important thing of all 
the company's operational activities in achieving its goals both to obtain company profits and maintain the survival of 
a company. The company's ability to maintain its organization depends on how to increase the effectiveness and 
efficiency of human resources to the maximum. 
Tamsan and Yusriadi (2022) revealed that the guidance of an organization's goals and the effectiveness of realizing 
the organization's objectives must be supported by all parties. It is what is meant as the guidance of the real goal. It 
means that a company must be able to build comfortable and conducive conditions or atmosphere where a leader can

Abstract 
This research aims to know and analyze the influence of human resource development and motivation on performance 
through the work discipline of the State Civil Apparatus (ASN) at the Jeneponto District Secretariat. The research was 
carried out at the Jeneponto District Secretariat Office for approximately 2 (two) months, from April to May 2021. 
This study uses a quantitative approach, with a population of all employees, namely 224 employees. The sampling 
technique is simple random sampling and uses Slovin, so the study sample is 143 people. Collection techniques 
through observation, interviews and questionnaires. Meanwhile, data analysis techniques use path analysis. The results 
showed that employee employment can be influenced by the development of human resources and motivation directly 
and through work discipline indirectly. In this study, it was found that motivation is the variable that has the most 
influence on improving employee performance in the Jeneponto District Secretariat. The level of influence exerted by 
motivation is seen from the magnitude of the organization's efforts or the leadership in giving awards to its employees. 
However, the development of human resources and work discipline has a good influence on improving employee 
performance. It can be seen from the aspect of human resource development with improvements in the organization's 
internal promotion system and work disciplines that trigger the emergence of employee awareness of the level of 
supervision inherent in him.

1. Introduction
State Civil Apparatus (ASN) is a state servant who has a responsibility in public service to realize welfare for the 
community (Law No. 5 of 2014). The spirit of reform has encouraged the State Civil Apparatus to reform and improve 
the state government system in development, protection, and services to encourage the needs and interests of the 
community. Civil Servants (PNS) sometimes come under scrutiny regarding their performance. Efforts to improve 
employee performance are a challenge because success in achieving organizational goals depends on the quality of 
human resource performance. High employee performance is very expected. The more employees who have high 
performance, the organization's productivity will increase so that the organization will be able to survive in global 
competition. 
Many factors can affect employee performance, including human resource development, motivation, and work 
discipline. Human resource development is preparing individuals to assume different or higher responsibilities within

Human resource development can encourage the improvement of apparatus performance through work discipline at 
the Jeneponto District Secretariat. Work discipline is an important aspect that is a mediator of the efforts made by 
organizations in improving employee performance. Human resource development driven by organizations can 
increase a high level of discipline for employees, which then impacts performance.  
Motivation can encourage the improvement of the performance of the apparatus through the discipline of work at the 
Jeneponto District Secretariat, assuming that other factors affecting the magnitude and small of motivation are 
constant. Indirect influence in this study, work discipline as an important variable that can improve the performance 
of employees in the Jeneponto District Secretariat. It is shown by the motivation provided to improve discipline and 
discipline that is well applied to improve their performance. This indirect influence shows that the work discipline 
variable remains a fairly good variable in moderating the relationship between motivation and employee performance 
in the Jeneponto District Secretariat. 
6. Conclusion
Based on this research, it can be concluded that employee performance can be influenced by developing human 
resources and motivation directly and through work discipline indirectly. In this study, it was found that motivation is 
the variable that has the most influence on improving employee performance in the Jeneponto District Secretariat. The 
level of influence exerted by motivation is seen from the magnitude of the organization's efforts or the leadership in 
giving awards to its employees. However, the development of human resources and work discipline has a good 
influence on improving employee performance. It can be seen from the aspect of human resource development with 
improvements in the organization's internal promotion system and work disciplines that trigger the emergence of 
employee awareness of the level of supervision inherent in him.

Abstract 
Performance can be measured through five indicators: quality, quantity, knowledge and skills, timeliness, and 
communication. The five measurement indicators are expected to form variable performance of logistics personnel 
through social capital and work capabilities in the South Sulawesi Regional Police (Polri) Brigade Mobile (Brimob) 
Unit. Therefore, with knowledge management to achieve the performance of logistics personnel through social capital 
and work capabilities in the South Sulawesi Police Brimob Unit as expected with performance achievement with 
operational, coaching, and administrative activities. This research approach used quantitative descriptive research to 
obtain a complete picture of the variables studied. The time used to conduct research is for 6 (six) months, from August 
2020 to January 2021. Researchers obtained a population of Logistics personnel of the South Sulawesi Brimob Unit 
which amounted to 130 people. All the populations in this study were responded to, but at the time of data retrieval, 
only 98 people could be used because it was the only complete data. In comparison, as many as 32 people were 
incomplete due to retirement, mutations, and temporarily carrying out under operations control, so it could not be used 
in the analysis. The findings in this study of knowledge management of social capital and work capabilities on 
performance have a positive and significant influence. In contrast, knowledge management testing of social 
capabilities and capital on work capabilities and indirect testing of knowledge management on work capabilities 
through social capital shows a positive but insignificant effect.

1. Introduction
The success of an organization depends largely on the activity and creativity of its human resources. The demands of 
technological and scientific advances in the global era as it is today can be met through increasing the ability of human 
resources in every organization, both government organizations and private organizations. Therefore, the development 
of human resources that are an integral part of the national development program needs to receive serious priority and 
attention from every government organizer to emphasize efficiency, speed, and professionalism in implementing 
government tasks to support complex development. 
Law No. 2 of 2002 concerning the National Police of the Republic of Indonesia, namely in Article 2, confirms that 
the function of the National Police of the Republic of Indonesia is one of the functions of the State government in the 
fields of law enforcement, Harkamtibmas, protection, sufficiency, and community service. Furthermore, the purpose 
of the National Police is regulated in Article 4 of Law No. 2 of 2002, namely, to realize domestic security, including 
maintaining public security and order, order, and the establishment of the law, the implementation of protection, 
sufficiency, and service to the community, and the development of community peace by upholding human rights. In 
addition to these functions, there are also the main duties of the police stipulated in Article 13 of Law No. 2 of 2002,

Brimob personnel, the logistics department of the South Sulawesi Regional Police, carry out all work tools using a 
command protocol, where the role of change becomes a strong analysis for implementation. With the sense that all 
social capital can be used personally. It is likely to improve the individual capabilities of each personnel, but it does 
not necessarily provide an increase in overall work capability.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The research results obtained in data analysis testing showed the indicators of each variable with the connectedness 
of each variable. However, statistical testing shows that of the five hypotheses proposed, two hypotheses have positive 
and significant influence, namely the influence of knowledge management on social capital and the influence of work 
capabilities on personnel performance. In contrast, the testing of knowledge management on work capabilities through 
social capital has a significant positive effect. But the influence of knowledge management on social capabilities and 
capital on capabilities shows a positive but insignificant influence. This explanation gives an idea that direct testing 2 
(two) hypotheses are accepted, and 3 (three) rejected. In contrast, indirect influences are rejected, meaning that only 
two out of 5 hypotheses positively influence and impact every work carried out by Brimob personnel in the logistics 
department of the South Sulawesi Regional Police.

Abstract 
This research aims to determine (1) The direct influence of learning methods and environments on the quality of 
learning, (2) The direct influence of learning methods, environment, and quality on learning interests, (3) the Indirect 
influence of learning methods and environments on learning interests through learning quality. This research was 
carried out at State Junior High School (SMPN) 25 Makassar with a sample of 110 class IX students. The analysis 
used is linear regression analysis to determine the influence of independent variables on dependent variables, then 
analyze paths or path analysis to determine the indirect influence of independent variables on dependent variables 
through intervening variables. This study shows that learning methods and learning environments directly influence 
the quality of learning, then learning methods, learning environments, and learning qualities have a direct but 
insignificant influence on learning interests. Furthermore, indirect learning methods do not influence learning interests 
through the quality of learning; otherwise, the learning environment influences learning interests through the quality 
of learning.

teachers in the learning process will use must certainly be adequately presented so that students feel comfortable in 
the teaching and learning process so that the absorption of subject matter is more optimal (Firman et al., 2020; Sabrang 
et al., 2021). The accuracy of the learning methods is selected and used plays an essential role in improving the quality 
of learning. 
Learning methods directly impact learning interests but are not as significant as their effect on the quality of learning. 
The variables of learning methods need to be maintained. Still, they must be improved because interest in learning is 
a strong encouragement if the stimulus provided can stimulate the impulse. Learning methods that act as a stimulus 
need to be improved so that their influence on students' learning interests can be significant. His research revealed that 
if the learning method is used as a medium of transformation in learning. The expected competence in the learning 
process will be achieved. Methods that vary according to the competencies will hopefully stimulate students' interest 
in learning (Ilyas et al., 2021; Tamsah, Haris, et al., 2021). 
Furthermore, the learning environment, one of the research variables, is divided into three indicators: the school 
environment, family environment, and community environment. Regarding the quality of learning, the school 
environment indicator is the main indicator in influencing the quality of learning because the school environment 
indicator touches the student realm as a research sample and all aspects in the scope of the school. A school 
environment with adequate facilities and infrastructure can support the quality of learning. It is revealed that the family 
and community environment also contribute to improving the quality of learning. A good family environment is a 
very supportive situation in optimizing the child's personal social development (Nasriani et al., 2021). 
Unlike its effect on the quality of learning, the influence of the environment on learning interests is insignificant. So, 
it is necessary to improve the learning environment variables, revealing that the better the student's learning 
environment, the better the student's learning interest. The learning environment in this study is divided into indicators: 
the school environment, family, and community have their respective roles in influencing students' learning interests. 
The school environment as the main environment during the student learning process focuses not only on the 
procurement of advice and infrastructure but also on the interaction between teachers and students (Tamsah & 
Yusriadi, 2022). 
In line with the variables of learning methods and environments, it is known that the quality of learning directly affects 
students' learning interests. The study results are supported by research conducted that the quality of learning has a 
positive direct effect on learning interest. But the influence exerted is not significant; indicators used in the learning 
quality variables need to be maximized so that the effect on students' learning interests is more significant so that the 
learning process can be effective. His research states that improving the quality of learning means that efforts are made 
to realize or achieve the quality level of learning more and more effectively. 
5.2 Indirect Influence 
The results of the data analysis showed that there was no indirect influence of learning method variables on learning 
interests through the quality of learning. Learning interest, which encourages a student to follow the learning process, 
requires factors supporting the learning interest. Research revealed that students with a high interest in a subject matter 
tend to pay attention to the material to have a strong intention to follow the learning program. It is what needs to be 
raised by teachers so that students can feel comfortable and happy in taking lessons. Therefore, further analysis is 
needed to find other variables that can indirectly influence learning interests (Ansar et al., 2019; Awaluddin A et al., 
2019; Sahabuddin et al., 2019; Yusriadi et al., 2019). 
The learning environment as an independent variable and the quality of learning as an intervening variable have a 
relationship to affect students' learning interests; the variable needs to be maintained because if the variable is 
improved, then its effect on learning interests can also increase. In contrast to these results, the learning environment 
indirectly affects students' learning interests through the quality of learning. The conclusion is obtained based on 
statistical data results showing that the indirect influence is greater than the direct influence. 
6. Conclusion
Hypothesis testing obtained several results, namely, directly learning methods and learning environments have a 
significant effect on the quality of learning. Furthermore, learning methods, learning environments, and learning 
qualities directly affect learning interests, but the influence exerted is not significant, so it needs improvement in these

independent variables to exert a significant influence on learning interest variables. The hypothesis test further 
obtained the results that the learning method does not indirectly influence the interest in learning through the quality 
of learning. In contrast to these results, the learning environment indirectly influences learning interest through the 
quality of learning. Further analysis is needed to find other intervening variables supporting the indirect influence of 
learning methods on learning interests.

1. Introduction
The excellence in leadership, staffing the learning process, curriculum, goals, expectations, academic climate,
self-assessment, and community engagement (Masrullah et al., 2021). In this period of national growth, an
education system oriented to all sectors is needed, prioritizing contemporary and professional education
management paradigms. Therefore, educational institutions, especially universities, are expected to effectively
realize their participation as part of the mechanism of control over the existence of education itself.
Lecturer performance is one aspect that has a strategic role in improving growth and quality. For a university, one 
of the parties that play a strategic role in improving the progress and quality of the institution is the performance 
of lecturers. The lecturer is one of the essential elements in an educator system in universities. Regarding jobs and 
responsibilities, the role of lecturers is very important to realize the purpose of national education, educate all the 
life of the nation and state, and improve the quality of Indonesian people. It includes the quality of faith and Taqwa, 
noble character, mastery of science and technology, and art in the existence of Indonesian society is advanced, 
fair, prosperous, and ethical.

The t-test is used to assess the influence of motivation on job satisfaction. By comparing the t-value with the t-
table, then the test T. The effect is considered large if t-calculate > t-table and can be ignored if t-calculate < t-
table. Value T-table of 1,984 was obtained by looking at df 101 (n – 2; 103 – 2) of 5%. The value t-calculate for 
the motivation variable is greater than the t-table, 3.018 > 1.984, and the significant value is slightly 0.05,0.003, 
as seen in the table above. As a result, the motivational component positively and substantially impacts job 
satisfaction, justifying the hypothesis. The effect of the motivation variable on job satisfaction has a beta 
coefficient value of 0.265, which indicates that the motivation variable contributed to the increase and decrease 
in job satisfaction by 26.5%. 
 
The T-test is used to determine the effect of certification on job satisfaction. The influence is considered significant 
if t-calculate > t-table, and it is said not to have a significant effect if t-count < t-table. By comparing the t count 
with the t-table, test t is performed. The table's T-value is 1.984, specified by looking at df 101 (n – 2; 103 – 2) at 
α 5. The t count-value for the certification variable greater than the t-table is 7.196 > 1.984, and the significant 
value is smaller than 0.05, which is 0.000, as seen in the table above. The influence of motivational variables on 
job satisfaction has a beta coefficient value of 0.632 which means that the certification variable contributes 63.2% 
to the rise and fall of job satisfaction. As a result, the motivational component positively and substantially impacts 
job satisfaction, justifying the hypothesis. 
 
The T-test is used to assess the influence of motivation on lecturer performance. The influence is considered 
significant if t-calculate > t-table, then it is said not significant if t count < t-table. By comparing the value of t 
count with the t-table, test t is performed. The table's T-value is 1.984, specified by looking at df 101 (n – 2; 103 
– 2) at α 5%. The value of t-calculate for a motivation variable is greater than the t-table. It is 2.033 > 1.984, and 
the significance value is smaller than 0.05, to be exact, 0.045, as seen in the table above. The influence of 
motivational variables on lecturer performance has a beta coefficient value of 0.189, which shows that the 
motivation variable contributes 18.9% to the lecturer's performance. As a result, the motivational component 
positively and substantially impacts job satisfaction, justifying the hypothesis. 
 
The T-test is used to assess the impact of certification on lecturer performance. By comparing the value of t count 
with the t-table, test t is performed. Effect significant what does not count > t-table, and it is said not significant 
if t count < t-table. The table's T-value is 1.984, specified by paying attention to df 101 (n – 2; 103 – 2) at α 5%. 
The value t-calculate for the motivation variable is greater than the t-table, which is 4.148 > 1.984, and the value 
of significance is smaller than 0.05, which is 0.000, as seen in the table above. The certification variable for 
pedaling lecturer performance has a beta coefficient value of 0.189, which means that the certification variable 
contributes 18.9% to the fluctuating lecturer performance. Consequently, the certification variable positively and 
substantially affects job satisfaction, confirming the hypothesis. The t-test was used to assess the effect of job 
satisfaction on lecturer performance. Significant effect if t count > t-table, and no significant effect if t count < t-
table. By pairing the t count with the t-table, a t-test is performed. The T-table value is 1.984, determined by 
looking at df 101 (n – 2; 103 – 2) at 5%. The t-count-value on the job satisfaction variable is greater than the t-
table (2.618 > 1.984), and the person's significance value is less than 0.05 (0.010), based on the table above. As a 
result, the job satisfaction variable positively and substantially affects job satisfaction, which justifies the 
hypothesis. Job satisfaction on lecturer performance has a beta coefficient (standardized coefficient) of 0.266, 
which means that the certification variable contributes 26.6% to changes in lecturer performance. 
 
5. Conclusion  
After the discussion of hypotheses conducted through the results above, the conclusion can be seen below: 
Motivation and certification are the main factors in lecturers' job satisfaction at the Higher School of 
Informatics and Computer Management (STMIK) Makassar. It shows that the more motivated the

lecturer, the better the performance, which will help improve the quality of teaching and learning at the 
Makassar Higher School of Informatics and Computer Management (STMIK); The third variable with 
indicators that form these variables gives real meaning to the performance of lecturers through job satisfaction. It 
is maintained or further improved because job satisfaction gives a meaningful and real meaning to the achievement 
of lecturer performance; Motivation with the indicators that make up the variable gives a meaningful meaning to 
the performance of lecturers. The expected motivation in the form of physical needs, security needs, and 
achievement needs owned by lecturers contributes to better lecturer performance improvement; Certification with 
indicators that form these variables gives a meaningful meaning to the performance of lecturers, certifications 
applied in the form of competencies and additional income provide a real and meaningful contribution to the 
performance of lecturers; Job satisfaction with the indicators that make it up gives real meaning to the performance 
of lecturers. Job satisfaction in the form of satisfaction with superiors/leaders, satisfaction with work, and 
colleagues as lecturers contribute real to the performance of lecturers.

Abstract 
Factors that can trigger a decrease in the level of patient satisfaction with services, namely the management function 
that is applied, while other factors indicated as the cause of the decline in employee performance are the work 
motivation factor of nurses. This study aims to determine and analyze the influence of management functions and 
work motivation on patient satisfaction through nurse performance at the Lapai Health Center, North Kolaka Regency. 
This research uses a causality design and a quantitative approach. The location of this research is the Lapai Health 
Center, North Kolaka Regency. The population in this study was 137 patients treated in the Lapai Public Health 
Center, North Kolaka Regency, with a total sampling, so the study's final sample was 137 people. Data collection 
techniques were carried out through questionnaires and documentation, while data analysis used path analysis and the 
Sobel test. There are seven hypotheses in this study. The seven hypotheses indicate that the direct influence of the 
management function and work motivation are factors that can affect patient satisfaction at the Lapai Public Health 
Center, North Kolaka Regency. A good management function possessed by a nurse is not enough without the 
motivation given by the Lapai health center in North Kolaka Regency to nurses and the work motivation of the nurses 
themselves. Nurse performance is an intervening variable that can moderate the independent variable to the dependent. 
In this study, the tendency of the influence of the management function to be better in influencing patient satisfaction, 
so that the better the management function is carried out will increase the satisfaction of patients being treated. In 
conclusion, the applied management function and work motivation given to nurses impact the better level of patient 
satisfaction, evidenced by the ease with which patients receive services during treatment. Besides that, the quality of 
services obtained can also be improved. Likewise, good skills for nurses make it easier to understand what the patients 
being treated want.

Patient Satisfaction, Management Function, Work Motivation, and Nurse Performance 
1. Introduction
The service obtained by the patient is a service that is fast, practical, and allows the patient not to move. Management 
functions (POAC) are Planning, Organizing, Actuating, and Controlling. Management can be successful if the four 
functions above can be carried out properly. Weaknesses in one of the management functions will affect the overall 
management and not achieve an effective and efficient process. 
Performance in providing services is closely related to customer satisfaction because the quality of service motivates 
customers to establish strong ties with the Public Health Center (PHC) (Sorensen & Keil, 2021). The performance of

The effect of work motivation on patient satisfaction is positive and significant. This is supported by previous research 
mentioned by: Alfi, who concluded in their research that there is a positive and significant influence on work 
motivation on the implementation of care documentation; The influence of the management function through nurse 
performance on patient satisfaction is positive and significant. This is supported by Arsyad et al., in his research which 
suggests that, as we all know, the higher a person's knowledge, the wider his horizons will be. Vice versa, for someone 
with a low level of knowledge or less, the understanding of an object is limited (Arsyad et al., 2021); The effect of 
work motivation through nurse performance on patient satisfaction is positive and significant Andri also stated a 
significant relationship between motivation and work discipline and the productivity of nurses' performance in surgical 
and non-surgical IRNA rooms (Andri et al., 2021b; Kurniawan et al., 2022; Nath et al., 2021; Setianto et al., 2022; 
Suharyanto et al., 2021). Others  mention a relationship between motivation, training, and supervision of the head of 
the room on the quality of nursing care documentation (Andri et al., 2021a; Gladys et al., 2019). 
6. Conclusion
Based on this research, it can be concluded that the management function and work motivation can, directly and 
indirectly, affect patient satisfaction through the performance of nurses. Nurses' applied management function and 
work motivation impact the better level of patient satisfaction as evidenced by the ease with which patients receive 
services during treatment. Besides that, the quality of service obtained can also be improved. Likewise, it is easier to 
understand what the patients being treated want with good nurses' skills.

1. Introduction
Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) is a group of viruses that can cause diseases that humans and animals can experience. 
Individuals with this virus can cause health problems, namely, respiratory tract infections ranging from the common 
cold to diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome / severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (WHO, 2020). Covid-19 was first discovered in Wuhan, China, precisely in 
December 2019. Wuhan is one of the regions in China's central Hubei Province. On January 11, 2020, China finally 
announced that a person had been exposed to this virus. The National Health Commission (NHC) of the Republic of 
China then informed the public that this virus was called Corona Virus Novel and was referred to as Covid-19, which 
turned into a global pandemic. According to data collected by WHO (WHO, July 2020), the Covid-19 virus has spread 
to 216 countries and regions, with an estimated 14,765,256 cases globally and getting bigger as time goes on. America 
has the largest population of Covid-19, reaching 3,805,524 cases. Based on data from (WHO, 2020), many patients 
infected with Covid-19 are residents over 60 years. 
In Indonesia, data shows that about 93,657 people are experiencing this virus out of 269,603,400 people and occupying 
the 24th country level with the highest cases of 216 countries spreading Covid-19 (WHO, July 2020). In July 2020, a 
spokesman for the West Sumatra Covid-19 acceleration task force, explained that it had been found that 849 people 
had been exposed to the Covid-19 virus. According to further data from the Padang City Health Office, there were 
592 confirmed cases of post as of July 23, 2020. While the dominant age of the population who experience it is

1. Introduction
Fire is an event caused by an uncontrolled fire and can endanger human lives, buildings, or ecosystems. Fires can 
occur intentionally or unintentionally. And generally, they cause material and non-material losses (Rahawarin et al., 
2020; Zacharias et al., 2021). In carrying out their duties, personnel or firefighters are equipped with various facilities 
and infrastructure related to fire handlings, such as special firefighting vehicles, protective equipment/self-protection 
in helmets, gloves, boat shoes, and other fittings. In addition to the facilities and infrastructure owned, firefighters are 
also equipped with knowledge obtained from education and training on fire management. Developed and developing 
countries have been established special units to deal with fire problems. In terms of fire management, there are 8 
(eight) main components must be met. Namely, government support in terms of regulations and regulations, using 
codes or standardization agreed upon globally, using established standards, implementing safety, skills development, 
enforcement of safety standards, readiness and responsibilities, and public education (Ilyas et al., 2022).  
Fires that occur are generally caused by events caused by nature and fires caused by humans. Therefore, efforts are 
needed to overcome or take precautions to minimize the impact of the fire itself, such as education or counseling the 
public about fire hazards, joint supervision of all forms of potential or fire threats, and fulfillment of active and passive

Figure 1. Path analysis 
 
 
 
The regression value coefficient (α1) shows that Knowledge (X1) has a positive effect on the readiness of officers 
(X3) by 0.253 (Figure 1); that is, if Knowledge (X1) increases by 1 point, then the readiness of officers (X3) of the 
Makassar Public Lung Health Center increases by 0.253 points. The significance level is 0.000, which is significant 
because it is smaller than 0.05.  
 
The alpha regression coefficient (α2) showed that training positively affected officer readiness by 0.709. Each increase 
in training increased by 1 point, and the preparedness of officers (X3) of the Makassar Public Lung Health Center 
increased by 0.709. The significance level of 0.000 is interpreted as significant because it is smaller than 0.05.  
 
Nilai of regression beta (β1) shows that the knowledge variable (X1) has a positive influence on the performance of 
officers (Y) by 0.313; that is, if Knowledge (X1) increases by 1 point, then the performance of officers (Y) of the 
Makassar Public Lung Health Center increases by 0.313 points. The significance level is 0.000, interpreted as 
significant because it is smaller than 0.05. 
 
Based on Figure 1 above, the beta regression coefficient value (β2) shows that the training variable has a positive 
effect on officers' performance by 0.232. Each increase in training increased by 1 point, and the performance of officers 
(Y) of the Makassar Public Lung Health Center increased by 0.232. The significance level of 0.035 is interpreted as 
significant because it is smaller than 0.05.  
 
Based on Figure 1 above, it was obtained that the beta regression coefficient value (β3) shows that the readiness 
variable has a positive influence on the performance of officers 0.352. Each increase in readiness increased by 1 point, 
and the performance of officers (Y) of the Makassar Public Lung Health Center increased by 0.352. The significance 
level of 0.003 is interpreted as significant because it is smaller than 0.05.  
 
The direct influence of knowledge on officer readiness is 25.30% (0.253 x 100). At the same time, the amount of 
indirect influence of knowledge on officer performance through officer readiness is (0.253 x 0.352) = 0.089 (8.90%). 
Thus, the total amount of influence can be determined as 0.342 (34.2%). 
 
The amount of direct influence is 70.90% (0.709 x 100). Then the indirect influence of training on officer performance 
through officer readiness amounted to (0.709 x 0.352) = 0.249 (24.9%), so the total influence of training on officer 
performance through officer readiness is 0.958 (95.80). 
  
5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of analysis and discussions, the knowledge possessed by officers working at the Makassar Public 
Lung Health Center with various backgrounds both in terms of age, education, occupation, sources of information, 
and experience is not the same can be done. Demonstrate the ability and readiness of officers to impact the performance

of officers in fire management efforts. Then the findings of this study show that the training carried out by officers 
will improve the readiness and performance of officers in fire management efforts. Then the results of mediation tests 
that have been carried out, officers' readiness can mediate the influence of knowledge and training on officers' 
performance at the Makassar Community Lung Health Center. It can be said that the knowledge and training possessed 
will be able to improve the readiness of officers so that it can have an impact on improving the performance of officers 
in fire management efforts.

Abstract 
This research aims to determine the Influence of Organizational Culture and Education and Training on Job 
Satisfaction Through Work Discipline ""in the Procurement of Goods / Services in Central Mamuju Regency. This 
research was carried out in the Procurement of Goods and Services Section of Central Mamuju Regency for 2 (two) 
months. This study used a quantitative approach, purposive sampling techniques, and a sample number of 50 
respondents. The method of analysis is path analysis (Path Analysis). The Substructure, 1 Pathway analysis test 
showed that the coefficient value of the organizational cultural path to the work discipline was 0.713 with a 
significance of 0.000, which means a positive and significant influence. The results of the sub-structure 2 test showed 
the coefficient value of the organizational cultural path to job satisfaction of 0.374 with a significance of 0.000, which 
means that there is a positive influence and recognition of organizational culture on job satisfaction. The Education 
and Training path to job satisfaction coefficient value is 0.088 with a significance of 0.269. It means there is no positive 
and significant relationship between education and training ""to job satisfaction. The coefficient value of the path of 
work discipline to job satisfaction amounts to "",430"" and significant,000"", which means that education and training 
have a positive and significant relationship to job satisfaction. The results of the indirect influence test prove that 
organizational culture through work discipline has no significant effect on Job Satisfaction. In contrast, education and 
training through work discipline have a significant positive influence on Job Satisfaction in the Procurement Section 
of Central Mamuju Regency.

1. Introduction
This research examines the influence of organizational culture and education and training on job satisfaction through 
work discipline in the procurement of goods/services of the Central Mamuju regency. Based on the initial 
observations, researchers found several problems that need to be considered in the Procurement of Goods / Services 
of Central Mamuju Regency related to the development of human resources, especially in the education and training 
of employees (Ilyas et al., 2022; Tamsan & Yusriadi, 2022). The organization's strength in the Procurement 
Department of Goods / Services of Central Mamuju Regency has not fully improved employee performance and 
discipline. It can be seen from the often-late employees enter the office, returning home earlier than the set hours of 
return resulting in service to the community is often hampered (Arfan et al., 2021). The problem is related to Job 
Satisfaction in the Procurement of Goods / Services Section of Central Mamuju Regency is still not running optimally 
(Rusli et al., 2021; Seppa et al., 2021; Sukimi et al., 2019). It can be seen in terms of quality; there are still many 
employees who cannot match their field of work.

Hypothesis 1. Based on the results of the analysis, the value of Organizational Culture significance (X1) of 0.00 < 
from 0.05, so it can be concluded that there is a direct influence of Organizational Culture on Work Discipline (Y1). 
Thus, the hypothesis is acceptable; Hypothesis 2. Based on the results of the analysis, an Education and Training 
significance value (X2) of 0.01 < from 0.05, so it can be concluded that there is a positive and significant direct 
influence of Education and Training on Work Discipline (Y1). Thus, the hypothesis is acceptable; Hypothesis 3. 
Based on the results of the analysis, the value of Organizational Culture significance (X1) of 0.00 < of 0.05 was 
obtained, so it can be concluded that there is a direct influence of Organizational Culture on job satisfaction (Y2). 
Thus, the hypothesis is acceptable; Hypothesis 4. Based on the results of the analysis, the value of Educational and 
Training significance (X2) of 0.088 > 0.05, so it can be concluded that there is no direct and significant influence of 
Education and Training on Job Satisfaction (Y2). The hypothesis is unacceptable. 
 
Hypothesis 5. Based on the results of the analysis, the value of work discipline significance (Y1) of 0.00 < from 0.05, 
so it can be concluded that there is a positive and significant direct influence of work discipline on job satisfaction 
(Y2). Thus, the hypothesis is acceptable; Hypothesis 6. Based on the results of regression coefficient calculations, it 
is known that the value of the direct influence of X1 on Y2 is 0.374, and the indirect influence is 0.306, which means 
that the value of indirect influence is smaller than the value of direct influence. Thus, it can be concluded that indirectly 
the culture of the organization through work discipline has no significant effect on Job Satisfaction in the Procurement 
Section of Goods / Services of Central Mamuju Regency; Hypothesis 7. Based on the regression coefficient 
calculation results, it is known that the value of direct influence (X2) on job satisfaction (Y2) is 0.088 and indirect 
influence is 0.348, which means that the value of indirect influence is greater than the value of direct influence. Thus, 
it can be concluded that indirectly education and training through work discipline have a significant influence on Job 
Satisfaction in the Procurement of Goods / Services of the Central Mamuju Regency. 
 
5. Conclusion

and training through work discipline towards job satisfaction. In contrast, organizational culture through work 
discipline has no significant effect on job satisfaction in the Procurement Section of Goods / Services of Central

1. Introduction
Human resources are the organization's main asset, so human resources (HR) must be managed and utilized in a 
balanced and humane manner. It is a common thing that HR is the biggest asset for the organization. One of the 
important issues in the organization is the management of human resources in the organization, where the management 
certainly emphasizes the organization's goals. Organizational goals can be achieved when the elements in the 
organization support them, including the performance of employees in the organization (Umar et al., 2019). 
Human Resource Management at PT Pegadaian (Perseo) must be transformed towards human capital 4.0 management. 
This transformation requires at least two important elements of capability and culture. Through capacity building and

provide a very large opportunity to convey aspirations and feelings to the company or share between employees and 
superiors or employees with employees (Ilyas et al., 2021; Karriker & Mayo, 2021). 
 
5.3 Influence of organizational culture on performance 
The results showed that the better the organizational culture, the better the performance. Another thing related to 
performance is shown by employees being able to complete office work properly and correctly and complete 
additional work properly according to the specified time. In addition, at work, employees provide advice and direction 
to co-workers. Also, they are always present on time when entering the office. Be disciplined towards all applicable 
regulations in the office, and always maintain and care for the facilities and work equipment in the office properly. 
This result is supported by other study that the driving force of the organization's operations is the employee. If the 
employee's performance is good, the organizational performance will also increase. Many variables affect employee 
performance, one of which is organizational culture (Daniels, 2016; Harlan, 2013; Ilyas et al., 2021; Kovach-Hayes, 
2019). Organizational culture is a general perception shared by all organization members. Every employee who 
becomes a member of the organization will have values, beliefs, and behavior following the organization.  
 
5.4 Effect of work capability on performance 
The study results show that the better the work capability, the better the performance. Another thing related to 
performance is shown by employees being able to complete office work properly and correctly and complete 
additional work properly according to the specified time. These results are supported by the opinion expressed by 
Robbins, who defines ability as an individual's capacity to carry out various kinds of tasks in a job. Each person has 
strengths and weaknesses in abilities that make them relatively superior or inferior to others in carrying out certain 
tasks or activities. Management must know how people differ in their abilities and use that knowledge to increase the 
likelihood that an employee will do his job well. Capability contributes significantly together with effort and skills for 
one's performance (Aswar et al., 2021; Nurjayanti et al., 2021; Saifuddin et al., 2021). 
 
5.5. Effectivity of work forum performance improvement on performance 
The study results show that the effectiveness of the performance improvement forum is getting better. It will improve 
performance. The work improvement forum's internal activities provide a big opportunity to convey aspirations and 
feelings to the company or share between employees and superiors or employees. All employees can convey messages 
to the company either in messages containing criticism, suggestions, complaints, or work reports. The messages 
reported are in the form of work reports, several recommendations, complaints, or input on the needs of their 
employees. These results align with previous research that the effectiveness of focus group discussions (FGD) has a 
significant effect on performance (Cruz-González et al., n.d.; Dalton, 2009). 
 
 
5.6 Influence of Organizational Culture on Performance through  
The results show that if the organizational culture gets better, it will improve performance through the Effectiveness 
of the Performance Improvement Forum. The results of this study are supported by other study which explains that 
employees are the driving force for the organization's operation. If the employee's performance is good, the 
organizational performance will also increase. Many variables affect employee performance, one of which is 
organizational culture (Muhammad et al., 2021). Organizational culture is a general perception that all members of 
the organization own. Every employee who becomes a member of the organization will have values, beliefs, and 
behavior following the organization (Kasyadi & Virgana, n.d.). The effectiveness of the organization's performance 
improvement forum (FPK) is part of a very good organizational culture and can improve employee performance 
(Nellyanti et al., 2021; Saifuddin et al., 2021; Tonich, 2021).  
 
5.7 The Effect of Work Capabilities on Performance through  
The study results show that if the work capability gets better, it will increase performance through the Effectiveness 
of the Performance Improvement Forum. The results of this study are supported by previous study that capability 
contributes quite with effort and skill or a person's performance (Saifuddin et al., 2021). Through the activities of the 
performance improvement forum (FPK) within the company, it is possible to improve the capabilities and performance 
of employees. The internal activities of the Work Improvement Forum provide a very large opportunity to convey 
their aspirations and feelings to the company or share between employees and superiors or employees with employees 
(Burhanuddin et al., 2021; Nurjayanti et al., 2021).

School Culture, Leadership, Teacher Performance, and Learning Achievement. 
1. Introduction
The school culture has an important role in presenting comfortable learning conditions to realize the quality of 
education. This link to learning and teaching is not interpreted only as transferring knowledge from teachers to students 
but also as instilling various good habits for all school residents (Rahawarin et al., 2020). 
In addition, the school as an educational institution, its management is led by the principal. The leadership factor of 
the principal is related to efforts to improve teacher performance. Teacher performance is an important element in 
education, but it is also a determinant of the high quality of education. Teachers carry out teacher performance in 
carrying out their duties as a teacher and educators. Principals who can empower and motivate teachers to perform 
well and act as professional teachers and teachers can improve their quality (Cahaya et al., 2022). 
The goal of the desired teaching and learning process is the achievement of good achievements from students. 
Achievement is a combination of factors that can affect the learning process whether internally from learners or 
externally from learners. Generally, achievement is an individual desire that they want to achieve, in terms of students 
through learning activities trying to achieve the best achievements. Also, learning achievement is the implementation 
of the success of teaching and learning activities. Teaching and learning activities are the most basic activities in this 
educational institution. The success or failure of learning goals depends on the learning process experienced by 
students as learners.

Abstract 
This research aims to find out and analyze and elaborate on the influence of the school environment and parental 
motivation on learning outcomes through student learning behavior at UPT SMK Se-Branch Regional Office V 
Bulukumba-Bantaeng. Research is designed in the form of quantitative analysis. The research population is all SMKN 
students at UPT SMK Se-Branch of Regional Office V Bulukumba-Bantaeng as many as 11 SMKN. At the same 
time, the sample in this study involved five schools, namely SMKN 4, 5, 7, 8, and 11. Quota sampling techniques 
carry out sample determination, and the final sample obtained is 250 students. The data analysis technique used is 
path analysis. There are seven hypotheses proposed in this study, the whole hypothesis is accepted. Research shows 
that the school environment improves student learning outcomes compared to parental motivation. Indirectly, the 
variable of learning behavior becomes partial mediation, meaning that the direct influence is still effective and 
dominant in improving student learning outcomes, but directly learning behavior is very effective in improving student 
learning outcomes. The results showed that school support and parental motivation could positively and significantly 
affect student learning outcomes directly and indirectly through learning behavior at Bulukumba District Vocational 
High School. Students' level of knowledge becomes the dominant factor seen mostly from the learning results showing 
that the teaching methods applied well in the school environment have encouraged changes in student learning 
behavior to be better and more enjoyable. Also, the motivation of people who encourage the formation of productive 
learning habits for their children shows maximum learning outcomes for students at Bulukumba District Vocational 
High School.

1. Introduction
Vocational High School is secondary education with an educational concept that prepares its students to enter the 
world of work with the knowledge of expertise obtained. As stated in the National Education System Law No. 20/2003 
article 15, Vocational High School is a form of vocational education that prepares its learners to work in various fields. 
Student learning outcomes are one of the indicators of educational success. Learning outcomes play an important role 
in learning, where learning outcomes can be a benchmark for changes in the learning experience. According to Cahaya 
et al. (2022) and Tamsah et al. (2021) that student learning outcomes must reveal aspects of thinking ability (cognitive 
domain), aspects of values and attitudes (affective domain) and aspects of skills (psychomotor domain) attached to 
each student Tamsah et al. (2020) suggests where learning outcomes are consistent behavior in the self-due to the 
interaction of individuals over their environment.  The school environment is one of the factors that can affect student 
learning outcomes. The school environment can be a good place for character growth. According to Rahawarin et al. 
(2020) that the school environment is a factor that contributes to the development of intelligence in children. The 
school environment with its influence either directly or indirectly can occur as in daily interactions with fellow 
schoolmates, while indirect is reading books and so on.

Abstract 
Many students, particularly 4th-year Architecture and Industrial Engineering students, have been influenced by the 
change to e-learning in the Philippines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This puts a strain on college students’ 
efforts to fulfill daily academic demands, which can negatively impact their well-being and motivation to study. Due 
to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the education sector adopted a new normal in the form of Online Learning. 
This paper addresses different factors affecting students academic performance such as academic workload, stress 
level, and procrastination in online classes. The study aims to establish the multiple regression  relationship between 
academic workload, academic stress, academic procrastination and academic performance.This study benefits and 
serve awareness for students, faculty teachers,Commision of Higher Education(CHED), and future researchers 
towards the factors that could affects the students academic performance based on the level of workload, stress, and 
academic procrastination.The number of participants of architecture students with 107 and industrial engineering 
students with 71 with a total of 178 students. The results shows , the average level of procrastination is 26.75(High) 
for architecture students and 28.4(High) for industrial engineering students. While the average academic workload for 
architecture students is 16.95(High) and for industrial engineering students is 17.49(High), the average academic stress 
for architecture students is 26.75(High) and for industrial engineering is 17.75(Moderate). The results showed that 
academic workload and procrastination had a significant relationship with students' academic performance based on 
the indicated coefficients with a 95% confidence interval with, R-squared = 47.84% variance shows that the 
independent variable a had a significant relationship in students' academic performance, which is normal since 
predictive analysis of human behavior tends to give a value of less than 50%.

Abstract 
The concept of resilient and sustainable supply chain network design provides a suitable solution to balance economic 
problems, environmental and social disturbances in the design of the supply chain network. This concept is a strategic 
and tactical decision in designing a supply chain network to determine the location (suppliers, manufacturers, 
distributors, and retailers) and the allocation of the number of raw materials or products. This paper aims to provide 
an extensive systematic and bibliometric overview of 'supply chain network design' as a term and concept. The Scopus 
database contained articles from 2010 through 2022. We analyzed 155 articles from 74 journals and 38 publishers, 
reviewed the compiled articles, and classified them using the VosViewer software. The analysis was conducted on 
productive journals, the most cited articles, keywords, research objectives, and attributes considered in each 
sustainability dimension. VosViewer is used to visualize bibliometric literature reviews. The indicators used in the 
aspects of resilience and sustainability in the supply chain network design are reviewed. This research will contribute 
to future academic and practitioner work on supply chain network design

1. Introduction
Supply chain network design (SCND) is a strategic supply chain planning where the process is carried out to build 
and model the supply chain by considering the cost and time in delivering goods or services to the market with the 
available resources. The supply chain network design includes all the movement and storage of raw materials, work-
in-process inventory, and finished goods from the point of origin to the consumer. This includes planning, 
implementing, and controlling supply chain operations. The infrastructure and physical structure of the supply chain 
is determined in the SCND process, which is part of the planning phase in supply chain management (Govindan et al., 
2017a). This topic encourages the interest and motivation of researchers to analyze it (Nagurney, 2010). The goal of 
an SCND mathematical model is usually to minimize costs or maximize profits. However, in recent years, attention 
has increased on supply chain sustainability, where the success of supply chain management is measured more broadly 
by considering economic, environmental, and social factors. 
The impacts of climate change affect people in every region of the country, threatening lives and livelihoods and 
damaging infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems. Increasing global warming and rapidly changing 
environmental conditions have threatened the world's sustainability to a hazardous level. So as part of overcoming the 
climate crisis, participation from all parties is needed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere

The research studies the options for including SC intermediaries to take the role of supply agent or supply 
contractors to manage the supply of items when traditional/classical supply networks known to us were almost 
inoperative or ineffective in fulfilling buyer requirements. SC intermediaries can help overcome supply chain 
sustainability and resilience failures. These middlemen are frequently a part of the world's supply chain. By SC 
intermediates, unique organizational forms that play a role in global sourcing are recognized. These forms 
occasionally take the form of supply contractors or organizations that provide finished goods. When markets have 
only been operating on a small scale for online transactions and all production companies, have not been running 
because the necessary staff is unavailable. As a result, supply management systems are not functioning. 
 
Each of the strategies mentioned above may have a varied impact on how well SCN performs concerning various 
performance assessment metrics, such as profitability under normal and disruptive conditions, environmental and 
social concerns. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper presents a systematic literature review on themes related to resilience and the design of sustainable supply 
chain networks. Based on the Scopus database from 2010 to 2022, 155 articles were obtained from the original, more 
enormous collection of 218 articles. In the context of this research, this research presents a systematic and bibliometric 
that focuses on the resilience and design of a sustainable supply chain network taking into account the existence of 
uncertainty. Bibliometric analysis was performed to find out trends each year, the name of the publisher and the name 
of the most productive journal, citations and network visualization. Descriptive analysis for publishers who publish 
the most topics raised is Elsevier Ltd, while for the most journals from Industrial and Computer Engineering. The 
article by Klibi et al., published in 2010, had the highest total number of citations, but Govindan et al. (2017) had the 
highest citation ratio per year. A literature study was conducted to determine the methods used in previous studies, 
consideration of parameter conditions, indicators on economic, environmental and social aspects, and indicators and 
types of resilience strategies. The results show that this research area continues to grow yearly. It was found that the 
network design policy taking into account environmental, social, and disturbance aspects began to be done a lot. The 
various resilience strategies that have been carried out can be developed or combined between these strategies to get 
the best strategy. So, we encourage future studies in this area. We will also be interested in exploring network design 
strategies under stochastic conditions close to actual conditions. The limitation of this study is that this study uses a 
single database, namely Scopus and articles collected from 2010 – March 2022, where the topics discussed can 
continue to develop over time. Therefore, research on this topic must be repeated in the coming years. Future studies 
should use a larger sample size with the keywords used. Future research is needed to use mathematical modelling for 
SSCND to comprehensively consider the presence of disturbances and uncertainties. In addition, there is a need for a 
combination of resilience strategies in designing networks to obtain optimal goals.

Abstract 
In supply chains, the circular economy is a good practice that influences the change of: processes and flows, relations 
between actors from different sectors, financial management, the role of suppliers and the form of consume of the 
consume of the customers. For these reasons, the circular economy becomes a challenge for supply chains in the path 
of reaching circularity. This research aims to evaluate the circular economy in the supply chain of mining industries 
in the province of Manabí, Ecuador, through diagnostic techniques. An investigation was conducted at the province 
of Manabí, Ecuador. The mining industries and other companies related to this activity were identified. With this 
information, the map of the study chain was prepared. A checklist was applied for the evaluation of the circular 
economy. This tool has nine variables (source or supply of materials (raw materials), design, manufacturing, economic 
circle, distribution and sales, consumption and use, collection, relocation and sustainability) and 91 items. A Likert 
scale of: 1 (very low), 2 (bass), 3 (medium), 4 (high) and 5 (very high) was used. At the same time, eleven principles 
and five characteristics of the circular economy in the chain are valued. As a result, it was obtained that the circular 
economy level of the chain is medium, with a value of 3.08. The variables with greater weak, distribution and sales 
(with an average of 2.97) and consumption and use (with an average of 2.98). The principles of low evaluation is: 
industrial and territorial ecology, and the use of materials (value 1 is very low). The affected characteristics is to work 
towards energy use from renewable sources (with a value of 2, low). In addition, the environmental impacts of this 
chain were analyzed. This element is a starting point to continue research.

4. Conclusions
This work is a preliminary study that allowed the evaluation of the circular economy in the supply chain of quarries 
in Manabí -Ecuador, through a checklist. At the same time, the principles, characteristics and elements of the circular 
economy were analyzed. The theoretical elements of the circular economy and its application in the supply chain of 
quarries in Manabi-Ecuador were founded. The types of existing quarries and the materials they supply were defined, 
throwing the different varieties of mining and classifying them according to the type of material they exploit. This 
will allow future research to continue the study of circularity in the chain with studies of subjects.

Abstract 
Contact mechanics has been largely used for the prediction of the behavior of material internal stresses due to external 
interactions. The analysis of these problems in the elastic regime was first done by Hertz, who focused on the behavior 
of the stresses in the near vicinities of the contact. The case of a ball interacting with an infinite plate is a special case 
of Hertz’s theory, which was originally designed for the interaction between two spheres. For this case, classical 
equations for the prediction of maximum normal pressure and maximum reaction force are still being used, which 
date as back as 1948. These equations however, seem to significantly overestimate the maximum normal pressure 
generated by the interactions of these two bodies, an observation also induced by the authors which first derived these 
results. Besides the presence of questionable theoretical basis, a significant proportion of the literature still takes these 
models as the only and irrefutable source of theoretical estimations. This paper shows the derivation of new contact 
mechanics equations for the case of a ball being dropped on an infinite plate of the same material. The derivation of 
these equations takes Hertz’s theory as a fundamental preliminary. It assumes a sphere of radius R falling from a 
vertical distance h from the plate. The contact is assumed to be elastic, and so the Work-Energy Theorem was used to 
calculate the work to be done by the plate on the sphere to decelerate it. Given that the integral solution for the work 
experienced by the sphere using this method is significantly complex, a series expansion around the origin is used. 
Additionally, given that the change in the independent variable is significantly small, the first term of this expansion 
results in a good approximation of the original solution. Therefore, the proposed model is:

Where 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝑣𝑣) is the maximum normal stress experienced, E is the Young’s modulus, 𝜎𝜎 is the Poisson’s ratio, 𝑣𝑣  the 
speed of the ball right before contacting the plate and 𝜌𝜌 the material’s density. This model, compared to the classical 
equations, takes into account the ball radius and predicts much lower maximum normal pressures by predicting a lager 
contact area, as expected.

1. Introduction
In order to understand how materials fail under specific load cases, it is important to investigate how the internal 
stresses behave and what are the loads that induce them. When the internal stresses reach the critical material 
resistance, several mechanisms of failure could occur, depending on the material properties and load scenario. The 
goal is to know when, where and how these stress levels are reached, giving us the opportunity of preventing material 
failure. For this reason this topic has been extensively studied in the literature, with the aim of understanding the flow 
of stresses within a body under different loads.   
Gahr (1987), who compiled some of the most relevant results regarding material mechanics in his work, shows several 
important equations for the prediction of material behavior. In particular, he shows the equations that predict the 
behavior of internal stresses generated by static loads between bodies of the same material (between spheres, between

The models proposed before have been used extensively without scrutinizing their validity, reason for which it is 
highlighted the need for an update of the models to be used in future.  
6. Conclusion
In order to prevent material failure, it is crucial to know the loads tolerated by the material and the possible mechanisms 
of failure. In the literature, very few researches show the derivations for theoretical prediction of load magnitudes in 
dynamic scenarios. Most of the literature show results derived in the 1940s’, without scrutinizing the validity of such 
models. In this research, the authors derive new equations for contact mechanics in a dynamic case. In particular, it 
was possible to derive an expression that predicts the maximum load and pressure experienced by a plate due to a ball 
hitting its surface after free fall. It was also possible to compare the proposed model with the model mostly used in 
the literature, fulfilling in this way the objectives of this research. It was observed that the proposed model predicts 
much lower maximum forces and pressures, being in average five times lower than Davies’ contact model, which has 
been found to estimate surprisingly high values for pressures and forces in dynamic scenarios. These findings represent 
a new approach to calculate the contact forces and pressures; an aspect that has been abandoned to date.

Abstract 
This project will explore the theory and application of converting a traditional 4-stroke Otto cycle internal combustion 
engine into an advanced high-performance Serial / Parallel hybrid powertrain. A commercial off-the-shelf Permanent 
Magnet electric motor will be coupled directly to the front of the engine. This design will allow the electric motor to 
act as an electric supercharger to aid in vehicle acceleration during high loads, charge the HV (High Voltage) battery 
under deceleration (battery regen) and will provide advanced ""Stop - Start"" technology that will conserve fuel while 
the vehicle is at rest (stoplights). Along with mechanical knowledge, this project will also require electrical knowledge 
- safe practices around High-voltage (300v) battery packs, deep understanding of ""Serial"" and ""Parallel"" battery
module orientation and their effect of voltage and amperage flow, high amperage connection requirements, low-
voltage circuit wiring to monitor electricity usage. The innovative part about this project is that we are attempting to
make a 600+ horsepower ""Prius"" engine using parts from eBay and the local automotive dismantling yard. Outside of
multi-million-dollar hyper cars such as the McLaren ""P1"", Ferrari ""LaFerrari"", Koenigsegg ""Regera"" this type of
hybrid powertrain has never been attempted.  Primary components for the system:
●
Air-cooled, 150kW three-phase PM brushless synchronous motor and matching motor controller from
Danfoss (""UQM-Danfoss PPHD 250(+) Motor & Controller"". EV Source, 2022).
●
Battery pack consists of 84 Panasonic lithium ion “prismatic” cells totaling 7.6kW/h (Energy.Gov, 2022).
●

Figure 16. Honda Insight Acceleration Result 
 
The graph in the Figure 16 above shows a logarithmic growth where after a certain speed after 70 mph, the graph 
indicates a sign of plateau. Meanwhile, from the graph the distance (ft.) increases exponentially and as it increases 
there is a logarithmic increase in the speed (mph), hence, making them rather proportionally correlated but at some 
distance the speed becomes plateau, and the distance keeps increasing. For this project, due to lack of funding and 
time, the experiment to record the actual data wasn’t carried out this fall 2022, hence the reference values are 
presented to show the expected results (Avt.Inl.Gov, 2022). 
 
6. Conclusion 
From all the data collected and work done, it can conclude that the parts of objectives were achieved, which were to 
clean the V8 engine and draw a design on SolidWorks to visualize this theory. Reference values were presented to 
show the targeted values for this experiment, since due to the lack of funding and time, the entire project wasn’t 
completed such as successfully assembling the parts (V8 engine, Grid Coupler, Electric Motor, Battery, and BMS) 
physically, from which it would’ve given some experimented values after diagnosis.

Abstract 
Study purpose is to provide a mechanism for overcoming the barriers towards implementation of big data solutions 
in true sense for the organizations, which are not ready for future industrial demands. Interrelated theoretical lens 
of contextual leadership theory and strategic alignment model along with data analysis of 279 top manager from 
FMCG sector in Pakistan representing south Asian region provide support in favor of presented mechanism. 
Result analysis shows that organizational optimizations including top management commitment, strategic 
planning and departmental collaboration mediates the relationship between digital leadership and big data 
analytics. Furthermore, big data analytics has direct positive effect of data driven decision-making.  Study has 
important managerial and theoretical implication that no matter how strong is the leadership, means through which 
the desire outcome could be achieve should not be ignore. 
Key words 
Digital leadership, big data strategic planning, big data analytics, data driven decision making, Strategic alignment

1. Introduction
A Survey of several hundred of organizations shows that the organizations, which are ready to meet the future 
demand of fourth industrial revolution earned 16% extra than the average net profit margin of the relevant industry 
Weill and Woerner (2018). 
Current study integrates strategic and operational level for optimizing strategic alignment model in context to big 
data through digital leadership. Digital leadership is allocated for motivating top management commitment with 
its directions and to formulate strong strategic planning with its digitalized vision and for promoting departmental 
collaboration for implementing big data solutions (Agung and Darma, 2020; Klein, 2020).  
1.1. Research Problem 
Organizations who are not in category of future ready organization are most likely to suffer or even replace by 
new startups and agile competitors (Weill & Woerner, 2018). Therefore, this problem is challenging existence of 
all traditional organizations and pragmatic researchers have to provide a clear and concise framework for dealing 
with it. 
1.2. Research Importance 
Recently a case study was conducted by Surbakti et al (2020) that also stresses that strategic alignment, 
departmental collaboration and top management support should be studies for providing empirical evidence that 
these organizational factors can influence big data usage effectively. 
Contextual leadership theory suggests that leaders should adopt leadership style according to situation and desired 
outcomes. In the context of this study contextual leadership refers to digital leadership, it will formulate strategic 
planning through its digitalized vision (Kane et al. 2019; Klein, 2020; Wasono & Furinto, 2018). Secondly, Digital 
leadership will enhancing top management commitment as it has the capability to provide vision and directions 
(Kane et al., 2019), whereas, Wasono and Furinto (2018) and Klein (2020) claimed that digital leadership has the 
capability of promoting collaboration. Enhanced top management commitment, strategic planning formed through 
the digitalized vision and directions and departmental collaboration will create synergy and alignment among 
tangible and intangible resources, which will enhance big data analytics capabilities.

Abstract 
This study analyzes whether supervision and competence affect teacher certification benefits in elementary schools in 
the Wara District of Palopo City. Then, the supervision, competence, and certification allowance affect teachers' 
performance in elementary school in the Wara District of Palopo City. Also, supervision and competence indirectly 
affect teacher performance through certification allowances at elementary schools in the Wara District of Palopo City. 
The approach used in this research is quantitative and belongs to correlational research. The sample in this study was 
167 people, using purposive sampling techniques. Technical data analysis is used in testing hypotheses, namely by 
path analysis and Sobel tests. This study showed that: 1) Supervision and competence have a positive and significant 
effect on teacher certification allowances in elementary schools in the Wara District of Palopo City. 2) Supervision, 
competence, and certification allowances positively affect teacher performance in elementary schools in the Wara 
District of Palopo City. 3) Supervision and competence also positively and significantly affect teacher performance 
through teacher certification allowances at elementary schools in the Wara District of Palopo City.

1. Introduction
Teachers are an important and main element in improving the quality of education in Indonesia in general. Teachers 
are at the forefront of ensuring education quality (G. Ilyas et al., 2022). Quality education must be supported by the 
presence of teachers who have adequate abilities. One of the criteria is that the teacher has good performance so that 
implementing the learning process in school can show better learning results. The government understands the 
problem of the importance of improving teacher performance, so the government makes a teacher certification policy, 
and teachers who have passed the certification will get certification benefits as a form of appreciation or government 
appreciation for improving teacher competence. The essence of teacher certification is the necessity for teachers to 
have competence so that teachers are entitled to obtain teacher certification benefits (Umar et al., 2019). 
In addition, the determining factor in improving teacher performance to be more optimal is to pay attention to aspects 
of academic supervision. In this case, the role of the principal as a supervisor is very important in helping teachers 
who are experiencing difficulties in the learning process activities. The competence possessed by teachers is also a 
determinant of the success of teacher performance in schools. It is in line with the theory set out by (Setiawan et al., 
2021), where a person's performance is determined by ability or competence in the implementation of work. 
The phenomenon and reality that occurred from the first observation about academic supervision found that some 
principals in Palopo regency had not drawn up academic supervision plans, and some principals had not had time to 
socialize. In addition, the principal's supervision component is not what the teacher needs; even worse, some principals

This study also showed that the variable that most affected the improvement of teacher performance was the 
certification allowance variable, followed by the supervision variable and competence possessed by teachers in 
elementary school in the Wara District Palopo City. It is because the certification allowance received by teachers 
becomes a separate encouragement for teachers to improve their performance for the better.

Abstract 
This research aims to find out and analyze the influence of teacher quality and the role of people through the quality 
of learning on the achievements of the State Madrasah Tsanawiyah Bantaeng. This research was conducted at the 
State Madrasah Tsanawiyah Bantaeng using a causality research design and a quantitative descriptive approach. Using 
purposive sampling techniques, the research population is all students of the State Madrasah Tsanawiyah Bantaeng. 
Using purposive sampling techniques, as many as 270 students obtained a final sample of 160 students. Data collection 
methods are carried out using observations, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation—data analysis using path 
analysis with SPSS Software Version 25. The results showed that the direct influence of the role of parents on 
improving the quality of learning provides the highest influence value compared to other direct influences. However, 
the lowest correlation is shown in the indirect influence of teacher quality on student achievement through the quality 
of the learning process at the State Madrasah Tsanawiyah Bantaeng. The quality of learning achieved by the State 
Madrasah Tsanawiyah Bantaeng looks better with students' higher level of compliance in the following education. 
The high relationship can be seen from cultivating the students' moral values and the formation of behavior through 
an emotional approach more teachers do.

1. Introduction
Education is the process of educating and guiding students to achieve certain goals in the form of positive changes in 
children. Education starts with the family, namely parents. Parents are the first madrassas for children. Without 
parents, children cannot get a proper education. It needs regular guidance and supervision because the child's life is 
the responsibility of the parents.  
In the globalization era, every country competes in achieving progress for its nation. Education is one of the main keys 
to the progress of the nation and state. Developed and modern nations are nations that pay attention to and prioritize 
aspects of education. Education is the process of educating and guiding students to achieve certain goals in the form 
of positive changes in children. Education starts with the family. Namely, both parents then continue with the 
community environment and formal education. The change in question is part of the maturity process that continuously 
takes the form of maturity in children. Education has a strategic position in facilitating and succeeding national 
development programs because education increases knowledge and skills and helps shape the nation's personality.  
To realize national education, the role of teachers of parents, communities, government agencies, and teachers is very 
important. Teachers as educators and teachers are the determining factors for the success of every educational effort. 
That is why the discussion about curriculum renewal, procurement of learning tools to the criteria of human resources 
produced by education always boils down to teachers. This shows how significant the role of teachers is in the world 
of education.  
The number of Teachers in the State Madrasah Tsanawiyah Bantaeng is 46 people with 270 students. The research 
gap in the study is that according to the observations and initial analysis of the author that student achievement is still 
categorized as low. This is due to the lack of parental roles. The quality has not been a national standard. The learning

The influence of the variable role of school parents on the quality of the learning process is positive and significant. 
This means that an increase follows the increase in the role of parents in the quality of the learning process, assuming 
other factors that affect the magnitude of the parent's role are considered constant. The positive and significant 
influence of the role of parents on the quality of the learning process in State Madrasah Tsanawiyah Banteng can be 
seen from the results of the direct influence path analysis that shows the positive and significant influence of the role 
of parents on the quality of the learning process. 
 
The variable influence of parental roles on student achievement is positive but not significant. This means that the 
increase in parental roles is followed by the increase in student achievement, assuming other factors affecting the 
small quality of teachers are considered constant. The positive but insignificant influence of the role of parents on 
student achievement at the State Madrasah Tsanawiah Bantaeng can be seen from the results of the direct influence 
path analysis that shows the positive and insignificant influence of the role of school parents on student achievement.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion in this study related to student achievement analysis at State Madrasah 
Tsanawiyah Bantaeng, it can be concluded that among the influences of the variables studied, the direct influence of 
the role of parents on improving the quality of the learning process provides the highest correlation value compared 
to other direct influences. Meanwhile, the lowest correlation is shown in the indirect influence of teacher quality on 
student achievement through the quality of the learning process at State Madrasah Tsanawiyah Bantaeng. The high 
correlation of the influence of the role of parents on the quality of the learning process can be seen in the cultivation 
of high moral values towards students and the formation of good behavior through an emotional approach that is more 
carried out by teachers or teachers in school. The quality of the learning process achieved by teachers looks better 
with higher student compliance to follow the classroom and field learning. The learning process felt by students is 
better and more interesting because teachers can engage students emotionally without showing rigid teaching 
behavior. This encourages them to be more active in learning activities. Thus, the better the quality of the learning 
process felt by students, the better the role of parents in the school environment. On the other hand, the lowest 
correlation was found in the indirect influence of teacher quality on student achievement through the quality of the 
learning process because some teachers feel indifferent to learning activities and student activities. There are teachers 
to fulfill teaching obligations and do not want to know further the impact of learning they provide, whether it can 
improve the achievements of their learners or not.

1. Introduction
WHO (2020) states that human health can be adequately maintained with the availability of water and safe and 
hygienic sanitation. To prevent the Covid-19 virus, it is necessary to carry out WASH practices and manage OK 
community waste so that transmission and transmission can be better maintained. 
On January 7, 2020, the State of China had confirmed that there is one new type of disease, namely Covid-19 or 
Corona Virus. Then on January 30, a Public Health emergency was made because this disease spread so quickly to 
foreign countries. On March 25, 2020, there were 414,179, and as many as 18,440 died, or as many as 4.4% of the 
patients died from 192 countries. While in Indonesia alone, on March 2, 2020, there were 2 cases, and on March 25, 
2020, there were 790 positive confirmed cases (Zacharias et al., 2021). 
From the scientific evidence that has been done, it can be stated that the virus can be spread through a tiny spark where 
individuals who are very potentially infected are in direct contact with the patient. Preventing the virus can be done 
by washing hands regularly with water and soap, coughing and sneezing using ethics, and limiting direct interaction 
with infected parties, farm animals, and wild animals. While the government prevents the spread quickly, social 
distancing is set by keeping a distance and minimizing activities involving many people (Rahawarin et al., 2020).

There is a person or group of people who are implemented systematically. Directed and planned to strive for 
behavioural changes that can continue to achieve increased production, repairs, and revenue. It has a vital role in 
changing my mother in various ways, such as persuading, providing incentives, and coercive activities by creating a 
physical environment and forcing with applicable rules. 
5.7 The Effect of Extension Methods on the prevention of covid – 19 Through Social Distension  
The seventh hypothesis that the author submitted is accepted or proven. The influence of the extension method (X) on 
the prevention of covid -19 (Z) through social distension (Y2) found the direct influence of the extension method (X) 
on the prevention of covid -19 (Z) is 0.305 or 30.5%. For the indirect influence of the counselling method (X) on the 
prevention of covid -19 (Z) through social distension (Y2) is 0.856 x 0.505 = 0.432 or 43.2%. This means that the 
direct influence of < indirect influence obtained the results of 7,176 > 1,655, meaning that H7 is accepted, H0 is 
rejected. The extension method is better than the Prevention of Covid-19 through social distension in the Working 
Area of Paccing Public Health Centre Awangpone District Bone Regency. 
Question 1 obtained an average of 4.04, In question 2 received an average of 4.14. Question 3 got an average of 4.14, 
and question 4 earned an average of 4.13. From these results, it is known that the highest standard is questions 2 and 
3, so it is stated that many respondents who travel in areas with red zones, abroad, or areas with high exposure to 
Covid-19 and many also make close contact with sufferers. This is evidenced by the heightened perception of 
respondents on social distancing variables which shows that respondents or the public prefer to work from home 
during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
WHO explained that the government set social distancing to prevent Covid-19 that is increasingly widespread? Social 
restrictions are a step to prevent the spread of the virus by providing restrictions on visiting crowded places and having 
direct contact with other individuals. The implementation of the policy is not allowed to spread hands with other 
individuals and keep a distance of at least 1 meter when interacting with other parties. Mobile health counselling 
appeals to the community to improve social distancing compliance, namely working from home, learning from home, 
and maintaining a distance of at least 1 meter; this counselling is expected to reduce the incidence of COVID-19 (Rusli 
et al., 2021).

Abstract 
This study aims to determine and analyze the Effect of Quality of Service and Facilities on Patient Satisfaction through 
the Image of the Public Health Centre at Totoli Health Centre, Majene Regency. This research was carried out at the 
Majene Regency Totoli Health Centre, using a causality design with a quantitative approach. The collection technique 
uses observations, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, while the data analysis used is path analysis. The 
population in this study is all outpatients who have visited the Majene Regency Totoli Health Centre in the last six 
months, as many as 312 people, sampling using accidental sampling techniques; the final sample obtained as many as 
175 people. The study results showed that patient satisfaction at the Majene Regency Totoli Health Centre was 
influenced by the quality of service, including continuity, fairness, ease of access, affordability, and quality. The 
quality of service at the Majene Regency Totoli Health Centre includes the main elements that support the 
implementation of good benefits for the community. Still, the quality of service is not the only element of consideration 
for patients. Still, the completeness and comfort of the Public Health Centre facilities are also a consideration. The 
Image of the Public Health Centre as a value owned by the Public Health Centre is obtained with better quality of 
service and facilities. In indirect influences, the Public Image of Public Health Centre variable becomes a moderation 
variable that affects patient satisfaction quality of services and facilities. However, the results obtained get a low 
coefficient value due to differences in public perception (patients) in assessing services and dynamic patient traits that 
sometimes affect the services provided by the Public Health Centre. The different thing in this study is to explore the 
community's views (patients) to assess the quality of service and facilities. And Image of the Public Health Centre 
because what is considered good and complete by the service provider (in this case, Public Health Centre) does not 
necessarily get the same assessment from patients.

1. Introduction
Health is a basic need of every human being. A person cannot meet all the needs of his life if he is in an unhealthy 
condition. Therefore, health becomes the capital of every person/individual to continue his life properly. The quality 
of service cannot be separated from one interrelated profession, depending on the quality of medical services and 
nursing services provided to patients (Zacharias et al., 2021). 
Patient satisfaction is an important key to improving the quality of healthcare services; healthcare providers need to 
realize that the main advantage of the healthcare system is the patients. Indicators of measurement of patient 
satisfaction in the assessment of health services provided, with the increase in the growth of health services directly 
proportional to the increase in patient knowledge of what should be obtained, patients need a health care Centre that 
provides everything required.

trust, perception, and feeling for the patient to come back to visit.

The services provided include the availability of complete tools, ease of patients accessing Public Health Centre services, 
affordability provided with quality results. 
5.4 The Effect of Facilities on Patient Satisfaction 
Facilities have a positive and significant effect on patient satisfaction. Supported by Zacharias et al. (2021). The 
facilities provided responsiveness to the needs of patients, minimizing their costs and time because they could be 
quickly served so that they would be satisfied. 
5.5 The Effect of Community Image

patients who make outpatient and emergency visits, building patient relationships with officers by always openly 
serving patients, answering all forms of questions and problems patients express wisely. 
5.6 The Effect of Service Quality 
The quality of service has a positive and significant effect on patient satisfaction through the image of the Public 
Health Centre. It is driven by the patient's background, individual characteristics that pre-existed before the onset of 
the disease (predisposing factor), and various other factors that affect their mental attitudes and personality (Ansar et 
al., 2019; Darno et al., 2021; Nellyanti et al., 2021). At the Totoli Health Centre of Majene Regency, in encouraging 
the idea of a Public Health Centre through the quality of service and patient satisfaction, it was obtained that the same 
services provided in the same case occurred different levels of satisfaction for patients. 
5.7 The Effect of Facilities 
Facilities have a positive and significant effect on patient satisfaction through the image of the Public Health Centre. 
Public Health Centre Totoli Majene Regency encourages a positive image of quality Public Health Centre. Public 
Health Centre has several obstacles that are often complained about by most patients, such as standard service time, 
speed, availability of adequate facilities. These reasons are certainly not all true because the people who visit the 
Totolis Health Centre are very dynamic. Sometimes the visits are very many and sometimes few, so the negative 
assumptions of the community about the services they get at the Public Health Centre (Mustafa et al., 2020; Sam et 
al., 2021; Yusriadi, 2021). It can be a harmful effect that is not good for the Public Health Centre in the future because 
Public Health Centre. should be the community's closest health service provider. Which is considered to help provide 
first aid by its primary health care standards.

the Totoli Health Center of Majene Regency. The quality of service includes the main elements of service for the 
community. But the quality of service is not the only element of consideration for patients; existing facilities are also 
considered, such as planning, spatial planning, lighting, furniture, colors, and graphic design that are attractive to 
patients. The Image of the Public Health Centre as a value owned by the Public Health Centre is obtained with better 
quality of service and facilities. On indirect influences, the Public Image of Public Health Centre variable becomes a 
moderation variable that affects the quality of services and facilities on patient satisfaction. However, the results 
obtained get a low coefficient value due to differences in public perception (patients) in assessing services and dynamic 
properties of patients that sometimes affect the services provided by the Public Health Centre assess the quality of 
service. Facilities and image of Public Health Centre because what is considered good and complete by the service 
provider (in this case, Public Health Centre) does not necessarily get the same assessment from patients.

1. Introduction
Service firms lagged manufacturing firms in marketing use in the past because service firms were small or were 
professional businesses that did not use marketing or faced much demand or little competition. Of course, now 
everything has changed where at this time, the service industry plays a vital role and is no longer a field that does not 
need to use marketing. On the contrary, the service industry at this time has developed. It faces intense competition 
due to the growing number of competitors in the field—of services, including the service sector in Indonesia. 
According to Tamsah et al. (2021), service quality has five dimensions: tangible, empathy, reliability, responsiveness, 
and assurance. Suggests that the dimension of quality that is most widely used in measuring service quality is the 
quality dimension (Yusriadi, 2021; Yusriadi, bin Tahir, et al., 2020; Yusriadi, Tahir, et al., 2020; Yusriadi & 
Misnawati, 2017). For this reason, in this study, the purpose is to test and analyze whether it is true that service quality 
influences customer satisfaction and is relevant to hospitality, especially Village Midwives in Bulukumba Regency.

also increase. Several studies that support the results of this study, including G. B. Ilyas et al. (2021), suggest that it 
tangibly affects loyalty. 
 
5.4 Effect of assurance on patient loyalty 
The hypothesis test results show that the more assurance that includes the competence of officers, credibility, courtesy, 
and security increases, the patient's loyalty will increase. This is in line with Asnawati et al. (2021), who state that 
assurance significantly affects loyalty. 
 
5.5 Effect of patient satisfaction on patient loyalty 
Patient satisfaction has a significant and positive effect on patient loyalty. This means if the patient's assessment of 
the satisfaction attribute consists of as expected, handling complaints, and the reasonableness of the price, the higher 
the patient's loyalty. The results of this study also support previous research, namely: (1) H Tamsah, Haris, et al. 
(2021) found that inpatient satisfaction and service quality had a significant effect on repurchase intention. 
 
The hypothesis test results show that patient loyalty will also increase when patient satisfaction increases at hospital 
admission, doctor services, nurse services, patient eating and drinking services, inpatient room facilities, and 
administrative and financial services. The results of this study are by the results of research (Adnan et al., 2021), who 
state that satisfaction has a positive effect on loyalty. 
 
5.6 Tangible effect on patient loyalty through patient satisfaction 
Hypothesis testing produces an overview of the ability of patient satisfaction in mediating the actual impact on patient 
loyalty. In line with the results of this study, Rinantanti et al. (2019) suggested that satisfaction mediates the tangible 
effect on adherence. With physical evidence such as the comfort of the inpatient room, completeness of equipment, 
availability of medicines, and good tidiness of the staff. It will directly lead to the satisfaction of the patients being 
served so that they will want to believe, consider reusing them, and recommend them to others. 
 
5.7 The effect of assurance on patient loyalty through patient satisfaction 
Patient satisfaction can mediate the impact of security on patient loyalty. Several studies that support the results of 
this study include (Nasrullah et al., 2021; Hasmin Tamsah et al., 2021), which suggest that patient satisfaction can 
mediate the influence of the assurance dimension on loyalty. The assurance variable has a positive and significant 
effect on patient loyalty. This means that the higher the service guarantee of a hospital, the higher the patient loyalty 
and vice versa. So, the second hypothesis in this study has been proven true. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study concludes that achieving patient loyalty in RSUD Datu Pancaitana increases the tangible aspects, assurance, 
and patient satisfaction. As the performance of concrete and assurance increases, patient loyalty will also increase and 
advanced patient satisfaction, which will improve patient loyalty either directly (directly) or indirectly (indirectly).

Lecture Plus Method, Role of Parents, Quality of the Learning Process, and Student Learning Outcomes 
1. Introduction
The effectiveness of the teaching process depends on the educator and the individual student. To obtain student 
learning outcomes in the achieved category, the teacher must educate and teach students using the learning methods 
needed in the learning process in the classroom. One of the learning methods used is the lecture plus practice. 
In addition to the learning method factor, the role of parents as a form of external factor also affects student learning 
outcomes. The achievement of good student learning outcomes cannot be separated from encouragement to parents. 
Learning outcomes are the result of implementing learning activities in schools. Student learning outcomes in the 
classroom are combined into learning outcomes, resulting from interactions between learning behavior and teaching 
behavior. Learning outcomes can increase if there is an increase by making consciously planned efforts that can lead 
to positive changes, called the learning process (Dwi Riyanti et al., 2016; Kadir et al., 2021; Ponniah et al., 2008). The

The plus lecture method essentially always refers to teaching methods in learning. The aim is to realize them to 
overcome the unique weaknesses of using these methods. The use of appropriate learning methods will affect student 
learning outcomes. 
5.4 The role of parents has a positive and insignificant effect 
The role of parents has a positive and insignificant effect on student learning outcomes at UPT SMAN 19 Gowa. The 
more qualified the part of parents is, the student's learning outcomes will also increase, and vice versa. If the role of 
parents is less qualified, the student's learning outcomes will also decrease. 
Parents have a high understanding of their children's education; they will pay more attention and try to realize the 
facilities and infrastructure needed by children to support learning activities. It can be seen from the previous learning 
experiences of parents who are very involved in their children's learning. Outcomes will pay more attention to facilities 
and infrastructure. that can support their children's learning activities, such as stationery, school bags, shoes—learning 
support books, module books, etc. Therefore, on average.

The quality of learning is a benchmark to determine the level of achievement of the learning objectives themselves. 
The learning objectives will provide the best learning outcomes for students, and quality can be defined as quality or 
effectiveness. 
5.6 The Lecture Plus method has a positive and significant effect 
The lecture plus method has a positive and significant effect on student learning outcomes through the quality of the 
learning process at UPT SMA Negeri 19 Gowa. The more quality the lecture plus method is followed by students, the 
rate of the learning process will increase so that in the end, it will also improve student learning outcomes. And vice 
versa. If the lecture plus method followed by students is of less quality, this will decrease the rate of the learning 
process. So that, in the end, student learning outcomes will also fall. 
Applying the lecture plus method as a learning method is efficient in student learning outcomes. The use of appropriate 
learning methods in the learning process will make the quality of the learning process effective so that the effectiveness 
of students in the learning process increases.

process at UPT SMAN 19 Gowa. The more qualified the role of parents, the rate of the learning process will increase 
so that in the end, it will also improve student learning outcomes and vice versa. If the role of parents is less qualified, 
then this will have an impact on decreasing the quality of the learning process, so that in the end, student learning 
outcomes will also increase—Will decrease. Parents should pay more attention to learning activities at home. Parents 
must remind children to do homework at school, remind children to repeat lessons at school, and accompany their 
children to study.  
6. Conclusion
The lecture plus method and the role of parents affects the quality of the learning process. that the higher the quality 
of the course plus practice, the quality of the learning process will also increase as well as the better the role of parents, 
the rate of the learning process will also increase. The lecture plus method has a more significant influence on the 
quality of the learning process than the influence of the role of parents. The class plus method, the part of parents, and 
the quality of the learning process also affect student learning outcomes. The more effective the lecture plus practice, 
the role of parents, and the rate of the learning process, the student's learning outcomes will increase. Of the three 
variables, namely the lecture plus method, the role of parents, and the quality of the learning process, the most 
influential on student learning outcomes is the quality of the learning process followed by the lecture plus method and 
the role of parents.

Data analysis also shows an indirect influence of the lecture plus method and the role of parents on student learning 
outcomes through the quality of the learning process. It means that if the address plus method increases, the quality 
of the learning process also increases and results in improved student learning outcomes. Conversely, if the lecture 
plus practice is less effective, the rate of the learning process will decrease and result in student learning outcomes 
also decreasing. Likewise, with the role of parents, the more significant the part of parents, the quality of the learning 
process will also increase, and student learning outcomes will also improve. Conversely, if the role of parents is less 
effective, then the quality of the learning process decreases and results in student learning outcomes also declining.

1. Introduction
National educational institutions must involve themselves in social, cultural, political, and economic interactions. This 
is important so that the world of education makes a positive contribution to comprehensive development, especially 
in facing various challenges in the era of globalization that affect all aspects of human life today. The application of 
an international standard performance system must be implemented so that educational organizations can compete at 
a global level. In the implementation of activities carried out by agencies, they are often faced with various obstacles 
and challenges that ultimately impact the performance of employees in the agency. The barriers and difficulties in 
question include the rapid development of information and technology and the limited human resources at the agency 
(Sawitri et al., 2019; Yusriadi, Sahid, et al., 2019). 
According to (Sukri et al., 2021) human resources are the primary key and have a significant role in every company 
activity. Quality human resources will determine the company's success in preparing plans, carrying out operational 
activities, and controlling the company's operations to achieve the goals that have been set. Areas that need attention 
in this regard include the readiness of human resources, technology, processes and ways of working, attitudes and 
behavior, motivation, and employee responsibilities that need to be instilled in them. So, human labor is the center of 
everything for an organization or institution. Humans can become the center of organizational or institutional problems 
if they are not developed and not improved. On the other hand, humans are the center of all corporate or institutional 
success when all their power is created fairly and convincingly (Sabrang et al., 2021). 
Employee abilities can also be in the form of skills that need to be continuously improved because skill is a person's 
ability to do something specific, focused but dynamic that takes a certain amount of time to learn and can be proven. 
Any skill can be learned but requires a solid dedication to understanding the science, such as the need for a positive 
mentality, motivational spirit, time, and sometimes money.

the performance of employees, to achieve an efficient and effective level of agency, the vehicle that is considered 
effective for this purpose is through the provision of motivation. This is in line with the opinion of (Sahid et al., 2020), 
namely: (knowledge) and motivational factors (motivation)"". 
 
Work motivation is a desire to make a high effort to achieve organizational goals and, simultaneously, a need if 
employee motivation is high so that high effort will determine high performance. (Seppa et al., 2021) states that 
motivation affects the type of adjustment made by employees to an organization. Therefore, every agency needs to 
increase the work motivation of its employees. This result is in line with research conducted by (Usman et al., 2020), 
which proves that workability and motivation significantly affect the performance of employees of the Mining and 
Energy Office of West Java Province. In addition, organizational commitment should also be considered by agencies 
where strong commitments will build personal employees who love their institutions to create high performance. This 
is in line with the theory. Stated by (Larsen et al., 2017) states that both past and recent research support the effect of 
organizational commitment on desired outcomes, such as performance and influence. This result is in line with 
research conducted by (Hasmiaty et al., 2021), which proves that organizational commitment has a significant effect 
on employee performance within the Regional Investment and Promotion Coordinating Board of West Java Province. 
Based on the opinion above, commitment and job satisfaction are also related to employee performance. This result 
is in line with Sawitri et al. (2019) research, which proves that organizational commitment has a significant effect on 
employee performance in the Promotion and Investment Coordinating Board. West Java Province. Based on the 
opinion above, ability, communication, and motivation are also related to employee performance. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The ability, communication, and motivation variables simultaneously and partially affect employee performance; the 
ability variable has a positive and significant effect on employee performance. The Communication variable has a 
positive and significant impact on employee performance; the most dominant variable that affects employee 
performance at the Graduate School Hasanuddin University is Employability. The results of this study support the 
results of previous research conducted (Yusriadi, Sahid, et al., 2019). This study concludes that work motivation 
influences employee performance and work motivation is a factor in improving performance. The results of this study 
support the results of previous research conducted (Ahdan et al., 2019). The results of this study conclude that work 
motivation affects employee performance. Work motivation as a factor in improving performance.

 Facilities, Quality of Service, Patient Satisfaction, and Reuse Interest 
1. Introduction
Hospitals as healthcare organizations are part of the health resources needed to support the implementation of health 
services. We are always required to make changes so that the service can be to the expectations and needs of the 
community whose goal is customer satisfaction, in this case, is the community of service users. Satisfaction itself is 
defined as an assessment of the characteristics or specialties of the product or service or the product itself, which 
provides a level of consumer pleasure related to meeting consumer consumption needs. Satisfaction can be created 
through quality, service, and value. 
One of the factors that affect the satisfaction of service users is the facility. To Tamsan & Yusriadi (2022), facilities 
provide physical equipment to provide convenience to customers in carrying out their activities or activities so that 
guests' needs can be met and satisfied. They are the benchmark of all services provided and have a very strong 
influence on customer satisfaction. With the level of existing facilities, it is also very easy for customers to be active 
and comfortable using existing facilities.

there is a relationship between the quality of service to the interest in reusing health services. 
 
Managerial implications on the influence of quality of service on reuse interests are patient behavior where the patient 
responds positively to what has been given by the hospital and is interested in making a visit back to the hospital, 
namely by improving the quality of service by tangibles (physical evidence), namely the physical appearance of 
service facilities, equipment / equipment, human resources and communication materials look attractive,  then 
reliability (reliability), namely nurses and officers have the ability to provide services promised immediately, 
accurately, and satisfactorily for patients, then responsiveness (responsiveness), namely nurses and officers have the 
ability to help patients and provide services with responsiveness, then assurance (assurance), namely nurses and 
officers have knowledge, compensation, and the ability to foster a sense of community Peraya to hospitals and  Lastly

Abstract 
This research aims to analyze how much influence the quality of human resources has on good governance through 
mastery of technology and creativity of employees of the South Sulawesi Provincial Government. This research is 
designed in the form of quantitative research. The research population is all employees of the Regional Secretariat of 
South Sulawesi Province, with as many as 214 employees. The sampling technique used is total sampling. The data 
analysis technique used is path analysis. This study proposes seven hypotheses; all hypotheses are accepted. The 
results showed that the direct influence of the quality of human resources contributes significantly to good governance 
rather than mastery of technology and work creatively. Indirectly, technological mastery and work creativity variables 
become good moderation variables even though they are partial mediation. Good governance with the main principles 
that include community participation, transparency, consensus oriented, equality, effectiveness and efficiency, and 
accountability can be increased with the quality of employees shown by employee understanding of the fields, 
knowledge, skills, and attitudes, as well as Technological mastery and work creativity contribute significantly to 
realizing good governance. The quality of human resources is the variable that contributes the most to good 
governance. The quality of human resources is a moral ethic that a person has in developing himself both technology, 
creativity, and good governance. Consequently, Good governance can be improved by the quality of human resources 
directly and indirectly through mastery of technology and work creatively.

1. Introduction
In the public sector, the quality of human resources of the apparatus is an important factor in encouraging the 
improvement of the government work system. Human resources are the sharpest highlight in the implementation of 
government regarding readiness, quantity, education, and professionalism. Because in the implementation of good 
governance, especially in the implementation of Law No. 3 of 2005 on Local Government, it is necessary to support 
the readiness of a steady-state apparatus (Baridwan, 2001). 
The quality of human resources is a very important asset in encouraging good governance compared to other 
organization elements. The thing that makes human resources different because humans are creatures who have a 
reason, the ability to develop, and have different desires from other means of production that cannot develop their 
abilities and have no desires. Quality human resources are needed in good governance; this is because, in the decision-

The influence of technology mastery variables on good governance is positive and significant. The findings of this 
study are supported by previous research (Asongu et al., 2019; Christina & Ronaldo, 2016; Rahadian, 2019; 
Suryandari, 2015). The Regional Secretariat of South Sulawesi Province recognizes that technology and information 
developments require a rapid response in the face of various changes in the situation that occur both internally and 
externally. Not a few public problems can be solved with the rapid advancement of technology and information. 
Technology has changed various dimensions of one's working life in both public and private organizations; mastery 
of technology becomes necessary with conditions and changes in work that occur everywhere.   
 
The variable influence of work created on good governance is positive and significant. The findings of this study are 
supported by previous research conducted by (Annisa et al., 2017; Maryam, 2016; Nasution, 2016; Nath et al., 2021; 
Suharyanto et al., 2021), who concluded the positive and significant influence of work created on good governance. 
Employee work creativity is more dominated by the employee's ability to do something new. The concept of creation 
in public officials' work has many dimensions. The importance of creativity in bureaucratic apparatus resources 
concerns factors of professionalism, experimentation, specialization, and capability in selecting alternatives and 
handling policy information. Work creativity allows increased effectiveness of employee work, such as understanding 
the job description (job description), which provides space for employees to apply many ways or creative ideas in 
completing a task, so it is important in implementing good governance.  
 
The variable influence of human resource quality on good governance through technical mastery is positive and 
significant. Although mastery of technology is important for an organization, human beings are still an important 
resource. An information technology system not only includes physical things (computers and printers) but also 
includes things that are not physically visible, namely software and, most importantly, human resources as users and 
actors. Good governance is a major factor in public services that require public responsibility. The findings of this 
study show that mastery of technology is quite effective in driving changes in employee work, where the main 
controller is human. The better the quality of human resources, the easier it is to access information and technology. 
It becomes a hope for a government institution to continue improving its services to the community. 
 
The variable influence of human resource quality on good governance through work creativity is positive and 
significant. The role of variable mediation of work creativity is considered important in improving good governance; 
the quality of human resources owned by employees in this study has implications for increasing employee work 
creativity to encourage public service functions (good governance). Employees of the Regional Secretariat of South 
Sulawesi Province have a good enough level of education from human resources quality. It appears that with better 
knowledge, skills, and understanding of the field, it can be a boost to manage their knowledge for the better by creating 
high creativity. The findings of this study show that employees as the organization's drivers have been able to improve 
the function of public services achieved with employees' creative ideas. The work creativity of employees of the 
Regional Secretariat of South Sulawesi Province has reduced employee stress. Creative people tend to calm 
themselves more easily with the things they like so that various problems can still be solved in a calmer state. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on this research, it can be concluded that the South Sulawesi Provincial Government applied good governance, 
especially at the Regional Secretariat of South Sulawesi Province. It can be improved by the quality of human 
resources directly and indirectly through mastery of technology and work creatively. Good governance has key 
principles: community participation, transparency, consensus-oriented, equality, effectiveness, and efficiency. While 
accountability can be improved by the quality of employees shown by the employee's understanding of their field, 
knowledge, skills, and attitudes, mastery of technology and work creativity contribute importantly to realizing good 
governance. The quality of human resources is the variable that contributes the most to good governance. The quality 
of human resources is a moral ethic that a person has in developing himself both technology, creativity, and good 
governance.

An agency is considered successful if the agency's performance has employees or employees who have high 
competence. Good performance will directly impact the progress of the company or agency and vice versa. Good 
performance is supported by a good work environment to mobilize these human resources. Organizations certainly 
want high productivity from their employees because, with high performance, their goals will be easier to achieve.

Abstract 
This study aims to find out and analyze the effectiveness of training and work discipline in improving the quality of 
individuals and the performance of employees of the Population Office and the Civil Registry of South Sulawesi 
Province. The research was conducted at the Population and Civil Registration Office of South Sulawesi Province for 
2 (two) months, from May to June 2021. The population is an entire employee of 105 people, using saturated sampling 
techniques, so the study sample is 105 people. Data collection is done by observation, interviews, questionnaires and 
documentation, and analysis of the data using path analysis. Several hypotheses are proposed in this study, and all 
hypotheses are accepted. The results showed that the direct influence of individual quality contributes greatly to 
employee performance compared to the effectiveness of training and work discipline. Indirectly, individual quality 
variables become moderate variables that are quite good even though they are partial mediation. In conclusion, in the 
Population and Civil Registration Office of South Sulawesi Province, the quality of individuals is indicated by the 
high morale of employees, which is a benchmark of quality in improving performance. In addition, the effectiveness 
of training is shown by increasing employee enthusiasm in following the learning process to improve their quality, 
and work discipline is shown by the leadership's transparency in encouraging high discipline. Indirectly individual 
quality variables can be good moderation variables in mediating the relationship between the effectiveness of training 
and work discipline to employee performance. Still, the most contributing is training effectiveness in influencing 
individual quality, which impacts employee performance.

1. Introduction
The quality of an organization depends largely on the quality of the organization's human resources. Both small and 
large organizations need competent and motivated human resources. This need is getting stronger as organizations 
grapple with the increasingly moving fast and more dynamic challenges. The achievement of organizational goals 
shows the results of the work/work performance of the organization and shows the performance or performance of the 
organization (Ansar et al., 2019).

improving the pattern of speed cooperation in working accuracy and employee understanding of their functions. 
Performance is the best work in the organization; quality characterizes the expected performance (Syamsyucri et al., 
2021). 
 
5.5 Individual Quality to Performance  
This research is supported by (Elgin & Bushnell, 1975). The findings of this study are that the role of individual quality 
variables can contribute to improving performance, mostly responding to high enthusiasm, and understanding in their 
fields. This is an important aspect of quality where a person can understand what they are doing in good quality.  
 
5.6 Effectiveness of Training on Performance Through Individual Quality  
On indirect influence, the findings of this study show positive and significant results that mean that the Population 
and Civil Registration Office of South Sulawesi Province can improve employee performance through the 
effectiveness of training and individual quality. Although indirect influence has a smaller mediating influence than its 
direct influence, it gives significant results in the sense that the effectiveness of training carried out is proven to be 
effective in improving the quality of individuals to have an impact on improving the performance of their employees. 
 
5.7 Work Discipline on Performance Through Individual Quality  
This study shows that individual quality variables are intervening variables that are quite good in mediating the 
relationship between work discipline and the performance of employees of the Population and Civil Registry Office 
of South Sulawesi Province. It means that the better the discipline of employees' work, the better the quality of 
employees, which can also improve the quality of individuals, which then has an impact on improving their 
performance. Indirectly, the role of individual quality in this relationship is lower than the relationship between 
training effectiveness and performance. So, it can be shown that work discipline is not so great an influence in 
improving the quality of individuals and employee performance. However, the effectiveness of training factors 
provides opportunities to improve individual quality and employee performance in the population and civil registration 
office of South Sulawesi Province. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on this study, it can be concluded that directly the quality of individuals is the variable that contributes the most 
to improving employee performance; this is shown by the higher morale of employees, which is a benchmark of their 
quality in improving performance. In addition, the effectiveness of training also affects employee performance which 
is shown by increasing employee enthusiasm in following the learning process to improve their quality. Likewise, 
work discipline also affects employee performance which is shown by leadership transparency is encouraging high 
discipline. Indirectly individual quality variables can be good moderation variables in mediating the relationship 
between the effectiveness of training and work discipline to employee performance. Still, the highest contribution is 
training effectiveness in influencing individual quality that impacts employee performance. The contribution of this 
research is the importance of maintaining and even improving the quality of individuals in the scope of the Population 
and Civil Registration Office of South Sulawesi Province. The apparatus factor becomes vital in this study so that the 
quality of individuals as intervening variables in this study is highly expected to exist.

1. Introduction
Employee performance will directly impact the progress or setbacks obtained by the company. According to (Ilyas et 
al., 2022) that, performance is the result of work that can be achieved by a person or a group of people in the 
organization, according to their respective authorities and responsibilities, to achieve the goals of the organization 
concerned legally, not breaking the law and by morals and ethics. Therefore, every company will always strive to 
improve employee performance to achieve company goals and objectives within a predetermined period. Maximum 
employee performance will have an invaluable positive impact on the company. 
Employee performance is inseparable from how effective employees do the work; employee performance is one factor 
that plays an essential role in organizational activities that need to be fostered and developed so that organizational 
goals can be achieved effectively. The effectiveness of employee performance is the completion of work on time by 
what has been determined. This means the implementation of the work is considered good or not, depending on the 
completion of the work. The importance of work effectiveness in achieving organizational goals is the key to the 
success of an organization. (Umar, Hasbi, et al., 2019) stated that work effectiveness is the optimal balance or approach 
to achieving human labor's goals, abilities, and utilization. If the implementation of the work done by the employee is 
better than set, then the employee is classified as an effective employee. Every leader is responsible for directing what

problems, 4) knowing the current situation to achieve success will be able to improve employee performance 
(Kasmiaty et al., 2021).  
5.6 The influence of transformational leadership styles and soft skills competencies on employee 
performance through work effectiveness 
This study shows that transformational leadership styles and soft expertise competencies empirically affect employee 
performance if mediated work effectiveness significantly. This study indicates that transformational leadership style 
variables can predict employee performance if mediated by work effectiveness.  
The implications of this study that 1) the ability to choose the right strategy in achieving work goals, 2) carry out 
important planning today and in the future, 3) effective implementation of work on expected goals, 4) supervision and 
control in work, 5) to achieve good and responsible work results driven by transformative leadership styles will be 
able to improve employee performance in the form of increased satisfaction due to ability and skills work. Work 
capability due to maximum utilization of resources increased commitment to working and fully responsible 
independently for what is given.  
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of research and discussion, the conclusion is obtained: Transformational Leadership Style and 
soft expertise competencies influence the effectiveness of employee performance and soft competence influences 
employee performance. In contrast, transformational leadership on employee performance does not affect employee 
performance. Furthermore, transformational leadership and work effectiveness affect employee performance through 
work effectiveness. This study implies 1) to express an opinion orally or in writing clearly and easily understood, 2) 
to be able to organize time well and manage the spirit of work, and 3) to be able to interact with others and adapt easily 
to it, can make decisions, and overcome various internal problems of the organization will be able to increase work 
effectiveness. The results of this study are also in line with the view that the role of soft skills employees is very 
important in building organizational strategies. The role of soft skills employees becomes important when excellent 
service is demonstrated by reliability and service commitment immediately, accurately, and satisfying consumers and 
customers.

Abstract 
This paper explores the applications of blockchain technology for sustainable supply chain management systems with 
an attempt to address the challenges that are facing the manufacturing industry. The supply chain management systems 
should be viewed as three components, namely, the strategic component, the tactical component, and the operational 
component. Therefore, an intervention requires the ability to trace the root cause(s) to ensure that technology-based 
solutions are tested through the three main components for usability. A systematic review was used for this paper to 
explore the applications of blockchain technology for sustainable supply chain management systems. This paper 
advocates for the application of blockchain on the basis that this technology is “the factory of the future” with the 
capability of creating transparency and traceability through all phases of the value chain from sourcing materials to 
final production. The findings suggest that blockchain increases auditing and compliance functionality, reduces costs, 
and creates a reliable ecosystem shipment process to prevent shipping fraud.  It should be conceded that there are 
technical challenges that cannot be overlooked, hence the evidence still suggests that there is a reluctance to adopt 
blockchain, which is making the industry lag behind. Furthermore, there is the possibility that some industries are still 
struggling with readiness assessment in order to justify and select the appropriate technologies.   
Keywords 
Blockchain technology, intelligent systems, supply chain management, value chain, operations management, 
manufacturing industry, and sustain competitive advantage. 
1. Introduction
Manufacturers are facing tremendous pressure from the complexity of the global business environment that demands 
the integrated system approach to address the improvement of quality, safety, environment, cost reduction and sustain 
competitive advantage.  This challenges the supply chain management systems to create an integrated partnerships 
linkage that ensures transparency, materials provenance, counterfeit detection, asset tracking, quality assurance, and 
the regulatory compliance and traceability of the flow of goods and services to the entire value chain. However, it is 
also imperative that manufacturers observe the second force that is complicating the global business environment in 
the form of the fourth industrial revolution. On the one hand, some manufacturers have taken advantage to flourish 
and build sustainable competitive advantage and human capital for sustainability, whilst, on the other hand, some are 
still reluctant to adopt these new technologies. On the other hand, these technologies create new business models that 
address some of the challenges.

5. Conclusion and future research  
The progress of blockchain technology as a field of study has gained popularity across disciplines and industries 
thanks to the advancement of technologies from healthcare, finance, renewable energy, supply chain, manufacturing, 
and agri-food value chain management, to name but a few. We also shed some insights on the emerging trends 
regarding the application of blockchain technology with the contributing factors for adoption and there is no doubt 
that blockchain is becoming prevalent in all industries’ value chains. Enabling visibility across processes and allowing 
customers to assess information and track products. Yet, seemingly are areas of improvement needed to address the 
barriers to the implementation of blockchain technology such as conducting a readiness assessment before the 
adoption. Furthermore, assessing the technologies’ actual potential within the context of the adopting organization. 
As a result, we believe that future research needs to investigate the approach or strategies that industries use to justify 
and select the appropriate technology with a particular focus on supply chain management.

Abstract 
The rapid growth of the industry in today's competitive environment has increased competition among companies. In 
order to gain business competitiveness, companies strive to focus on fulfilment of customer expectations of higher 
quality, lower prices, shorter lead times, and less environmental impact. Sustainability is an organization's ability to 
make decisions in real-time without an adverse impact on the future state of the environment, society and business 
stability. Since the production of most chemicals is highly hazardous and has the potential to cause irreversible 
environmental damage and have a negative impact on public health, safe and sustainable production is the main dictum 
for the development of sustainable chemical enterprises. Therefore, this paper addresses this issue by proposing a 
multi-method and multi-criteria decision-making framework for SSS in the chemical industry. Based on the specific 
characteristics of the chemical industry, this study uses AHP to analyse the economic, social, and environmental 
dimensions. Finally, this study will use Fuzzy MABAC to analyse alternatives. The proposed approach and decision-
making model can help supply chain managers in the chemical industry to select more sustainable suppliers, respond 
quickly to market demands, and maintain high competitiveness in the market. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
The rapid growth of the industry in today's competitive environment has increased competition among companies. To 
gain business competitiveness, companies try to focus on customer expectations of higher quality, lower prices, shorter 
lead times, and less environmental impact (Azadnia et al., 2015). Due to this competition, companies are trying to 
improve the performance of their entire supply chain. Supplier selection is an important decision step in supply chain 
design to reduce purchasing costs, supply risks, and environmental impacts and increase the price competitiveness of 
companies (Azadnia et al., 2015; Kannan et al., 2013). The number of companies that are aware of considering 
environmental practices into their strategic proposals and operations is increasing (Sarkis, 2003). Not only, it has led 
companies to ensure safe practices such as pollution control, reuse, recovery, but also brought positive impacts, such 
as improvement of business and public image, attraction of environmentally conscious customers, and improvement 
of quality (Molamohamadi et al., 2013).

Figure 1. Graphic of criteria’s weight 
 
From the figure above (Figure 1) it can be seen that the first important criterion in the economic aspect to assess 
supplier selection is delivery on time with a weight of 1.127, cost is the second important criterion with a weight of 
1.125, and the communication system is the third important criterion with a weight of 0.119. The first important 
criterion in the environmental aspect to assess supplier selection is employee benefits with a weight of 1.130, 
production safety is the second important criterion with a weight of 1.127, and continuous training is the third 
important criterion with a weight of 0.125. The first important criterion in the environmental aspect to assess supplier 
selection is recycling/reusing with a weight of 1.166, green materials and technology is the second important criterion 
with a weight of 1.157, and environmental training is the third important criterion with a weight of 0.143, this rating 
was obtained from a paired AHP which has been filled in by procurement experts at PT Teras Teknik Perdana. 
 
In this study, there are 4 important alternatives involved in selecting suppliers at PT.Teras Teknik Perdana. Next will 
be explained about the use of the Fuzzy MABAC method by considering the weight of the criteria. The linguistic 
variable is carried out to determine the weight of the supplier's interests, the supplier weight is obtained from the 
Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN) matrix and the criteria weight from AHP, the weights are shown in Table 6. Then 
the ranking results are carried out by calculating the final number of estimated border areas (Q), the highest final value 
is obtained PT. Saint Gobaint with a value of 1.21 and the lowest score was obtained by PT. Indoporlen Refractories 
with a value of 0.25. By using the MABAC fuzzy method based on the weight of the calculated criteria, PT. Saint 
Gobaint is the best supplier for PT.Teras Teknik Perdana.

Abstract 
The investigation of human resources and environmentally responsible creativity via the lens of organizational factors 
is a highly effective, albeit constrained, method for predicting the complex interconnections necessary for the growth 
of sustainability in small and medium-sized organizations (SMEs). In an effort to overcome these limitations, the 
author of this article proposes three models, each of which contains variables operating on two levels: creativity 
development (operating at the individual level), sustainable product organizational innovation (operating at the 
organizational level), and sustainability development. The Structural Equation Model was utilized in order to provide 
feedback regarding the theoretical model. This demonstrates that one's knowledge, drive, and relationships with others 
can all function as predictors of creative output at the individual level. In addition to this, creativity is investigated in 
terms of its role as a mediator between the performance of sustainable product creation and human resources. With 
this approach, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have an easier time determining which human resource 
(HR) factors should be prioritized for Product Innovation Sustainability (PIP) performance. This is done with the 
intention of reducing the impact of the Covid-19 problem and creating a more sustainable world. An online 
questionnaire was given to a selection of Java-based small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) in Indonesia, and 
their responses were used to compile the necessary data. The conclusions of this investigation provide credence to the 
most important discoveries, which were: (a) one's knowledge, (b) one's motivation, and (c) one's relationships all have 
a positive impact on creative output; (d) according to the three models, creative output fully mediates the relationship 
between human resources and the performance of Product Innovation Sustainability. This study makes a contribution 
to the existing body of research on human resources and the performance of Product Innovation Sustainability by 
adopting an approach that draws from multiple disciplines, conducting research at two levels, measuring the majority 
of the internal aspects of employees (want, emotion, idea, and feeling), and elaborating on the role of employee 
creativity as a mediator.

In the final structural model fit examined here (Relationships-Creativity- Product Innovation Sustainability), 2 = 
1033.350 (df = 272, p = 0.000) and 2/df = 3.785% (Jöreskog  2014). The final results of the three structural models 
indicate a good fit at the joints. 
5. Discussion and Conclusions
This research demonstrates two significant conclusions: (a) To create a sustainable PIS, managers must manage and 
nurture innovation in their employees, regardless of their HR management approach (knowledge, motivation, or 
relationship). (b) This conclusion shows the models' consistency and stability by accurately finding a positive 
correlation between creativity and Product Innovation Sustainability in each of the three models investigated 
individually. The results indicate that regardless of the HR model used, creativity is always an antecedent variable of 
sustained PIS. The study demonstrates that it is essential that each model produces the critical success characteristics 
for the growth of creativity and, as a result, sustained PIS. 
Integrated management systems (intranet) let firms store important data and reduce inefficient management practices 
like paper use and storage. The findings suggest that inner and extrinsic motivation factors influence creativity and 
persistent innovation. The results show that formal and informal interactions explain creativity and sustained 
innovation. Meetings, teamwork, and shared spaces or workplaces have a big impact on fresh idea generation and 
sustained creativity. Three structural equation models show how knowledge, motivation, and relationships can be used 
to create corporate talent for Product Innovation Sustainability (Maes  and Sels 2013). 
6. Limitations and Future Research
This could also lead to significant discoveries identifying the types of information, motivation, and relationships that 
have the greatest impact on creativity and, thus, on Product Innovation Sustainability. Future study should also address 
the possibility of unifying these three models in order to examine the impact of the HR dimensions in a single, 
comprehensive model. The work employs an advanced quantitative method, SEM, to evaluate the hypotheses, thus 
catering to the investigation of causal links with greater complexity. 
7. Practical Implications
This study underlines the importance of effective HR (knowledge, motivation, and relationships) to achieve the best 
degree of creative performance and generate more original and helpful ideas for any organization to develop or 
introduce. Hard assignments that require people to use their abilities and skills can create inner drive (which is 
important for creativity). 
To enhance creativity, a company needs a diverse workforce with various personalities. Managers must continuously 
invest in tacit knowledge  (Field  and Chan , 2018, Stankevičiūt and Savanevičienė, 2018), intrinsic motivation  (Palm 
and Rosengren, 2020,  Kalliath and Chan 2017),  
and informal connections (Zheng  and Xie , 2017) without neglecting explicit knowledge. 
Innovation necessitates a ""group"" strategy that includes stakeholders (such as employees, customers, suppliers, and 
governments). On the one hand, interested stakeholders assist in defining criteria and developing new innovation 
initiatives. Companies are utilizing their highest levels of innovation and human resources to adapt and develop new 
materials and medical equipment at record speeds in order to combine their lawful commercial interests with the huge 
societal aims that this field of work necessitates via the ""invisible hand.""  
Most companies concentrate on a single development objective at a time, and research has not yet addressed how to 
better incorporate sustainability and human resources into the innovation dynamic (Muñoz-Pascua 2019,  Fernandes 
et al, 2021).

Abstract 
Badminton is a popular sport in Indonesia. Brand competition for the shuttlecock market in Indonesia is relatively 
high. The quality of shuttlecock products is one of the requirements to be accepted in the market. Since 2014 BSN has 
issued SNI Standards, but this rule has not been used to guarantee the quality of the production of small and medium 
shuttlecock industries. There are six requirements in the application for type 3 scheme SNI certification for product 
certification. This research helps one of the requirements, namely product testing. This research examines and provides 
information to SMEs on whether their products follow the SNI criteria or not. Product testing uses the conformity 
method of the SNI 0036:2014 testing method regarding shuttlecocks. This research used 6 out of 7 criteria that can be 
measured with tools from the SNI rules. The sample used is ten brands of SMEs that already have brands and 
production capacity above 1000 slop/week. The use of process capability analysis in this study estimates how 
consistently the process meets the specifications determined by consumers to help improve the company's internal 
production processes. The results show that in the SNI conformity test, one brand passes the six criteria tested. The 
other brands fail in the aspects of feather length and hubcap height.

1. Introduction
Badminton is a popular sport in Indonesia (Hanifa 2019) and the demand for shuttlecock products is also increasing. 
The shuttlecock industry is growing and developing in Java Island, Indonesia. Cities that become centers of 
shuttlecock manufacture include Tegal, Malang, and Nganjuk. Different brands of shuttlecocks from well-known 
brands from abroad and domestically compete in the national market, which impacts SMEs that produce shuttlecocks. 
BSN (National Standardization Agency) has issued SNI rules for shuttlecocks since 2014 but until now there are still 
many SMEs that have not implemented these regulations. SNI certification for shuttlecocks is included in the category 
of sports equipment, namely SNI Scheme type 3. There are 6 requirements in the application for SNI certification 
scheme type 3, one of which is product testing. This study assists SMEs in carrying out the requirements, namely for 
product testing. The problem with local SMEs is that they have not standardized their products because they are not 
sure whether their products are feasible or not. This research records 3 centers in Tegal, Malang, and Nganjuk areas. 
There are 60 SMEs that already have brands, from the existing 60 SMEs, only industries that produce 1000 
Slops/month are taken. The data shows that only 10 SMEs are able to produce shuttlecocks with that amount, with the 
amount of production it is assumed that profits can be used for the process of applying SNI. If viewed from the 
administrative factor, SMEs already have a brand, and from an economic point of view, they are capable. In this 
research, samples will be taken from 10 brands measured using SNI rules. Of the 7 SNI criteria that can be measured

Comparative Analysis of CP with SNI certification for each Brand 
Based on the calculations that have been carried out, a comparative analysis of the results of the CP value with product 
pass is made according to the SNI rules for each brand, the following are the results: 
1. For Brand X1 shows the results of CP products that are capable of five aspects, while the aspect of Shuttlecock 
flying stability is not yet capable. For the results of SNI, all six aspects passed. 
2. Brand X2 shows capable product CP results for the six aspects. For the SNI results, the height of the hubcap and 
feather length aspects did not pass. 
3. Brand X3 shows capable product CP results for the six aspects. For the SNI results, the height of the hubcap 
aspect did not pass. 
4. Brand X4 shows the results of CP products that are capable of 4 aspects, only aspects of Weight and Shuttlecock 
flying stability are not capable. For the results of SNI for feather length aspects that have not passed. 
5. Brand X5 shows the results of CP products that are capable of 5 aspects, only the Weight aspect is not capable. 
For the results of the SNI for the height of the hubcap aspect that has not passed. 
6. Brand X6 shows the results of CP products that are capable of 5 aspects, only the aspect of Shuttlecock flying 
stability is not capable. For the results of SNI for feather length aspects that have not passed. 
7. Brand X7 shows the results of CP products that are capable of 5 aspects, only the Weight aspect is not capable. 
For the results of SNI for feather length aspects that have not passed. 
8. Brand X8 shows the results of CP products that are capable of 5 aspects, only the Weight aspect is not capable. 
For the results of the SNI for the height of the hubcap aspect that has not passed. 
9. Brand X9 shows the results of CP products that are capable of 5 aspects, only the Weight aspect is not capable. 
For the results of the SNI for the height of the hubcap aspect that has not passed. 
10. Brand X10 shows the results of CP products that are capable of 5 aspects, only the Weight aspect is not capable. 
For the results of SNI aspects of the height of hubcap and feather length that have not passed. 
From the results of the analysis, most SMEs are not capable of the weight shuttlecock aspect, namely 6 SMEs. As for 
the SNI certification of SMEs, many did not pass the aspects of the height of hubcap and feather length, respectively 
6 and 5 SMEs. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The following are conclusions that can be drawn from the research that has been done, as follows: 
1. 
From the results above, it shows that the X1 brand out of 6 aspects tested, all six of them passed, the X2 brand 
only the aspect of the height of the hubcap and the length of the feathers that did not pass, the X3 brand only the 
aspect of the height of the hubcap that did not pass, the X4 brand was only the aspect of the length of the feathers 
that did not pass, brand X5 with a high aspect of hubcap that didn't pass, brand X6 with an aspect of the length 
of a feather that didn't pass, brand X7 with aspect on length of a feather that didn't pass, brand X8 with high 
aspect on hubcap that didn't pass, X9 with high aspect on hubcap that didn't pass, and finally brand X10 with 
high aspect hubcaps and the length of the feathers that do not escape. 
2. The results of the process capability analysis show the test results of 6 aspects from 10 SMEs only the X8 brand 
has a high precision and accuracy value in all five aspects, only the heavy aspect needs improvement, while other

brands do not yet have a high level of precision and accuracy in the 6 aspects tested. These results will then be 
used as input to the company for proposals for internal process improvements. 
3. From the results of this study, it is hoped that it can help and facilitate SMEs to be able to understand the 
shortcomings or obstacles of their companies in completing the requirements for SNI certification, such as quality 
requirements that are still difficult to fulfill. Recommendations that can be given are that SMEs can improve 
product quality according to SNI 0036:2014 certification to improve product quality management.

Table 1 describes the conditions and implementation of the waqf system implementation in Figure 1. The results of 
the analysis show conditions where there are still some conditions that are not optimal. The work climate has been 
service-oriented, but the job satisfaction and service performance are still not good. Therefore, the need for policies 
and programs that can be followed up by the leadership. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This research concludes that a work climate and work culture that is service-oriented can increase job satisfaction. In 
the long term it can make a significant contribution to service performance. This research only uses case studies in 
certain institutions so that in the future it can expand the scope of research using mixed methods. Likewise, the 
description of the variables used is still very limited and needs to be explored with open-ended questions. 
 
The managerial implication that can be contributed is that the nadzir are increasingly understanding and supporting 
the implementation of the waqf system in the future because they are optimistic that the public will be more confident 
in entrusting their waqf to the institution. The institution remains committed to managing its waqf to be more 
productive and beneficial for the welfare of the community. Institutions can continue to learn to become ceed centers 
for digital-based waqf management so that they can become best practices for other waqf management institutions in 
Indonesia. While the theoretical implications of this research can contribute to theories related to waqf management 
from the behavioral aspect of waqf managers, especially nadzir.

Abstract 
This paper presents an approach for the detection and analysis of micro-scratch detected on the surface of steel cord 
(steel filament) using eddy current sensor (ECS). This work aims to point out and eliminate the defective products and 
containing surface defect in wet drawing process. In other words, a quality gate was established to prevent sending 
defective goods to customer. During wet drawing process, steel filaments were manufactured by drawing process 
through multi-dies system ranging from bigger diameter called brassed wire to smaller diameter called filament. An 
eddy current sensor was used to generate a high-frequency magnetic field around the sensor coil where the filament 
went through at the output end. The test coil was centered inline of wire path and connected to pre-amplifier then send 
the signal to instrument which was used to set working conditions for the experiment. If a defect appears when filament 
passes through the test coil, the eddy current will appear and sensor will send the signal to stop the wet drawing 
process. The artificial defect was created on a sample and the amplitude of those defects were measured to set the 
threshold. The amplitude signal of artificial defect was about 10% corresponding to specification of crack’s depth of 
20 micrometers. The production was carried out with applied setting condition under inspection of eddy current sensor. 
we produced 182 products x 38,000m, the defective ratio was 26.37%. There were two typical types of defect: the 
longitudinal scratches and the hole defect which containing an additional particle. In future works, the surface 
scratches will be collected, and then analyzed two positions including inside and outside of defect area in order to 
identify the atomic ingredients to identify the origin of the defects.

1. Introduction
In the manufacturing industry, the application of state-of-the-art technology is by far the most important in quality 
field. Among key performance indicators such as safety, cost, delivery and quality, continuous improvement in 
product’s quality is the trend of most of suppliers. Nowadays, it is necessary to reduce the risk of failure goods at the 
end users, it is the responsibility of steel cord manufacturers. There were many inspection approaches using the 
cutting-edge technologies to innovate the products in terms of quality, overall equipment efficient, cycle time, etc. In 
the current steel cord manufacturing site, the filament or steel wire is produced from many steps ranging from dry 
drawing, brassed plating, wet drawing and stranding. Among inspection technologies, a new defect inspection method 
called vision-based was developed to enable defective defection for steel wire rod so as to innovate the accuracy of 
inspection (Yun et al., 2013), or as (Wu et al., 2015) mentioned about a novel sensor system using the orthogonal test 
method to inspect the defect of wire rope. (Zhou et al., 2022) provided a visual sensing inspection to figure out the 
defect of wire rope with a better speed. However, the image technology is unable to investigate or prevent the defective 
goods to customer owing to a high volume in production and the shapes of surface defect are unlimited while the 
shapes of reference samples are limited. As mentioned before, the steel wire making process is conducted with a very 
high speed (input 400 meters/minute) and temperature (over 3000C) and the researchers only considered the wire rope 
with big diameters. Therefore, we present a new approach to inspect the filament with very small diameter in the 
production lines using eddy current sensor as a quality gate to prevent sending failure goods to customer by early 
detection and eliminate the defective products at manufacturer side.

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
In this research, we have proposed a comprehensive methodology for detecting micro surface defect on steel wire, 
using eddy current sensor technique. Eddy current sensor was tested with an artificial surface defects in order to set 
the working condition to apply for mass production and separated defective products which found with surface defects. 
This method can be applied in many various applications including manufacturing field as steel wire production, it 
can be set as a quality gate where the out-of-specification goods will be eliminated and improve the customer 
satisfaction. With this method, the failure rate occupied at 26.37% with 182 manufactured products, this defective rate 
will be calculated as a standard for the output yield. The detected surface defects were also verified by manually 
pulling back and compared the manual results to those obtained from eddy current sensor during production. There 
are two kinds of surface scratch, the first one is longitudinal defect with initial point and ending point and the second 
defect is diamond shape containing an external material. The novelty of this work is providing a state-of-the-art 
approach to defect the micro defect during a very high speed of machines, it helps to reduce the man power and replace 
human in terms of quality standard and reduce the failure risk at end user such as flat tire on the road, broken hose 
wires, etc. In the future works, surface scratches will be analyzed more detail such as cross-sectional, energy dispersive 
spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, dimensions in vertical and longitudinal direction as well, root cause/origin analysis and 
perform quality improvement.

Abstract 
Social changes in education caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have caused the online learning process to be more 
intensive which has led to an increased sense of isolation and independence, thus becoming a source of pressure for 
students. Continuous pressure can lead to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a serious mental illness that causes 
loss of work productivity and decreased quality of life. This mental disorder is most common in individuals with an 
age range of 18 to 24 years who are at the university level. The most common treatment technique used for GAD is 
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), as technology develops, this therapy has evolved into virtual reality exposure 
therapy (VRET). The combination of exposure therapy and VR allows users to experience digital versions of anxious 
real situations. In the diagnosis of GAD, psychologists use standard psychometric questionnaires as measurement 
methods such as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) 
questionnaires. Recently, another incipient and imperative method of valuation of anxiety has been formed by 
considering the use of physiological constructs such as EEG. Through EEG monitoring, the level of anxiety in 
individuals can be detected and measured efficiently. In this study, there are two groups of subjects one of which 
received two anxiety management techniques by VRET (mindfulness and imagery) called treatment group and the 
other received one anxiety management technique by VRET (imagery) called control group. The results of this study 
indicate that the two EEG channels used such as AF7 and AF8 channels in the treatment group and control group 
showed a significant decrease in power spectrum after receiving treatment using VRET. The use of the STAI 
psychometric questionnaire in this study was carried out to validate measurements with EEG which showed that in 
the treatment group before VRET as many as 63% of the questionnaire results were subjects with high anxiety, and 
after receiving VRET the level experienced a significant decrease which was dominated by subjects with low anxiety 
as much as 53%. In the control group before VRET had questionnaire results as much as 72% of the subjects had low 
anxiety and the rest had moderate anxiety, then after receiving VRET the subject experienced a decrease in anxiety 
which all subjects had low or minimal anxiety.

6. Conclusion 
The study offers interesting results. On the one hand, it confirms the possibility of using VR in the treatment of GAD 
in that both experimental groups improved clinical outcomes after the end of treatment. This is indicated by a 
physiological response in the form of a decrease in power on the spectogram which indicates that the subject 
experienced a decrease in anxiety after undergoing a VRET session. In addition, the results of the STAI Y 
psychometric questionnaire showed that the subject experienced a significant decrease in anxiety. In conclusion, this 
study shows that VRET can be used also in the treatment of GAD.

Abstract 
Peru has become one of the world's leading producers and exporters of organic coffee, so it is necessary to understand 
sustainable supply chain initiatives, which involve the 3 axes that encompass it (economic, social, and environmental). 
In this sense, the importance of risk factors within a supply chain to establish sustainable objectives is recognized. 
This research seeks to analyze and understand these factors and how they could impact the integration of sustainable 
development. For this, the methodology for modeling was System Dynamics. The results of the research showed the 
importance of understanding these factors that impact a coffee supply chain, so that with this information the 
sustainable conditions of production can be improved, since this is the most important factor in a coffee company. In 
this sense, two scenarios of the possible variability of demand were also presented, at a linear and exponential level, 
based on the analysis of historical data. When evaluating the scenarios, the linear variation was the best, since it was 
coupled in a constant and not abrupt manner to the change of carrying out a sustainable management in a coffee 
logistic chain. 
Keywords 
System Dynamic, sustainable development, environmental impact, supply chain and coffee. 
1. Introduction
Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages in the world, second only to water. It is estimated that more than 3000 
million cups are consumed daily in the world. (El Mundo, 2022) On the other hand, currently the system dynamics 
model has become widely used because it is able to study and model complex systems (Zhu, et al. 2021). It is a 
quantitative analysis that allows dynamic simulation to support long-term strategic decision making, which is based 
on systems thinking (Bashiri, et al., 2021). On the other hand, supply chain management is about managing the 
production and information flow of a product or service, from materials before processing to delivery to the final 
consumer. In addition, consumers are currently more aware of environmental care, a fact that has led the management 
of the supply chain of a product or service to become sustainable and concerned about reducing the negative impact 
of production processes on the environment, to have a competitive advantage in the market (Madero-Gómez and 
Zárate, 2016). Thus, sustainable supply chain management can be defined as the integration of thoughts, strategies, 
and management, including financial, ecological, and social performance (Bratt and Roberto, 2021). 
After oil, coffee is the second most traded commodity worldwide, so that approximately 400 billion cups of coffee are 
consumed annually (Sabora, 2022). However, according to the International Coffee Organization (2021), world 
production for the current period 2021-2022 will have a deficit of 3.1 million bags this season, while on the demand 
side, it will present an annual increase of 3.3%. Due to this problem, it is of utmost importance to have an efficient

6. Conclusion  
It is concluded that it is possible to model a supply chain in a system dynamics software that helps to understand and 
analyze the behavior of the different parameters involved in a coffee logistics chain to integrate the sustainable 
management of the processes. In this sense, new knowledge was generated to introduce sustainability in a supply chain 
encompassing coffee production processes. For a better integration it was necessary to investigate and understand the 
main risk factors that influence a supply chain, finding that the main ones are the following: exchange rate, red-yellow 
plague, use of green technologies, service level of suppliers, compliance with regulations given by the Peruvian 
government and the quality of coffee that encompasses agricultural productivity. By identifying each risk, it was 
possible to understand the influence of each one. This was done to evaluate their impact in the two scenarios presented. 
First, linear variation of demand and second, exponential variation; the best scenario being the linear growth, since 
there are better production and customer service indicators.

Abstract 
Occupational health and safety are a major problem in manufacturing. From 2019 to 2021, there are still accident 
cases where there is an increase in the incidence of work accidents from 2019 until now, making it necessary to 
investigate factors that influence accidents to be able to protect workers. This research aims to investigate the many 
stressors affecting two forms of stress experienced by workers, physical stress and psychological stress, in order to 
enhance their performance in terms of safety in a hazardous working environment. Using a structural equipment 
model, this study identified job demand, organizational stress, environmental stress, safety behavior, physical stress, 
psychological stress, and safety outcome. The study sample of 153 workers who completed questionnaires was 
developed according to the stressor relationship. Based on the result, recommendations are made to workers on how 
to reduce the risk of injury or accident.

1. Introduction
Occupational health and safety remain a significant issue for national economies, employers, employees, and society 
in general. Industrial sectors recording higher than average incidence rates included manufacture, transportation, and 
construction. The cost of workplace injuries is not only a human one; it also has serious economic implications for 
employers in uncertain times. The Employment Social Security Administration Agency (BPJS) noted that the number 
of work accidents in Indonesia was 234,270 in 2021. The number increased by 5.65% from the previous year, which 
amounted to 221,740. From 2019 to 2021, there are still accident cases where there is an increase in the incidence of 
work accidents from 2019 until now. One of the losses incurred was that there were 64 pieces of product that fell due 
to work accidents that occurred and an estimated loss of up to $22,000, as well as medical and recovery costs for work 
accident victims in one case. 
The purpose of this study was to examine the level of significance of the relationship between occupational stressors 
and injury outcomes, psychological and physical symptoms, and safety behaviors as experienced by manual laborers 
in the electronic industry who work in a production department. Workers' responses to a questionnaire used in earlier 
research about reported levels of workplace physical and psychological stressors and physical and psychological 
symptoms were gathered (Goldenhar et al., 2003).

In the indirect effect, there are 2 accepted hypotheses out of the 8 hypotheses built. where the accepted hypothesis has 
a different R square value. The accepted hypothesis is that there is an influence of the environment, job demand, 
organization, safety behavior, and physical stress variables on safety outcomes in the electronics manufacturing 
industry. As well as the indirect effect, there is a relationship in the environment that affects physical stress and has 
an impact on safety outcomes. And safety behavior affects physical stress and has an impact on safety outcomes. 
Based on the accepted hypothesis, there are several strategy recommendations, namely, first in the environment 
variable, rearranging the machine layout so that movement and handling become small. In terms of job demand 
variables, it is recommended to review and evaluate working hours and job allocation to workers regularly. In terms 
of organization, it is recommended to improve the relationship between workers and superiors. And in the safety 
behavior variable, it is recommended to review the guidelines for routine maintenance of personal protective 
equipment to avoid a decrease in safety behavior and to develop safety policies and practices (a safety program) in the 
organization. 
6. Conclusion
In the current study, three regression models were developed to explore the relationships between the three dependent 
variables i.e., physical stress, psychological stress, and safety outcome and various sets of independent variables. R 
square values were obtained to explain the percentage of variance in the three dependent variables. The R square value 
of Model 3 is comparatively low and moderate. This result reveals that, besides the two types of stress identified in 
the present study, there may be other independent variables that predict safety incident e.g., environment, the job 
demand and culture of the organization, the individual safety behaviors of coworker, etc. Based on the accepted 
hypothesis, there are several strategy recommendations, rearranging the machine layout so that movement and 
handling become small, review and evaluate working hours and job allocation to workers regularly, improve the 
relationship between workers and superiors, review the guidelines for routine maintenance of personal protective 
equipment to avoid a decrease in safety behavior and to develop safety policies and practices (a safety program) in the 
organization.

Abstract 
From 2004 to 2020, bribery has been known as the highest type of corruption that occurred in Indonesia. At the level 
of organization and corporation, bribery might affect the execution of tenders and contracts. It also increases costs and 
risks faced by the organization. Bribery has been known as one of the important issues that might lead to the 
deterioration of business operations and also the reputation of companies. Anti-bribery management system (ABMS) 
is expected to be one of applicable bribery mitigation strategies that can be implemented widely especially in state 
owned enterprises (SOEs). ISO 37001:2016 is one of the ABMS that is implemented by SOEs in Indonesia.  The Joint 
Decree or Surat Keputusan Bersama (SKB) of the Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Comission (KPK), the Indonesia 
Office of the Presidential Staff (KSP), the Ministry of Home Affairs of Indonesia (Kemendagri), the Ministry of 
National Development Planning Agency of Indonesia (BAPPENAS), and the Ministry of Empowerment of State 
Apparatus and Bureaucratic Reform in 2018 stated that the implementation of ABMS in the government and private 
sector was part of the focus to prevent corruption in 2019-2020. Thus, the ministry of SOEs in Indonesia released a 
regulation that encouraged all SOEs to implement ABMS immediately in 2020. This study is intended to study the 
implementation of the ABMS in an SOE operating in industry, specifically state-owned companies in the agribusiness 
industry. The implementation of the ABMS is expected to contribute to the effort to minimizing the risk of legal 
problems, improve cost efficiency, and also increase company competitiveness as a long-term vision. In this research, 
the analysis is carried out by analyzing the importance of variable in ABMS implementation in SOEs.

1. Introduction
Bribery is a type of corruption that occurs a lot in Indonesia, both within the scope of ministries, institutions and 
business entities or companies and organizations. According to statistical data on case handling by the Indonesia 
Corruption Eradication Commission or Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (KPK) in the period 2004-2020, bribery was 
the case that was handled the most, with a total of 708 cases in mid-2020 (Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, 2020).

6. Conclusion
The result from the data obtained shows that the Operation criteria is one that is considered as most of importance in 
the implementation of ABMS SNI ISO 37001:2016 in the company. Based on the understanding of operation criteria 
in the ISO 37001:2016, it implies it is important for the organization to apply both financial and non-financial controls 
to manage the risk of bribery associated with areas such as procurement, operations, sales, commercial, human 
resources, legal and regulatory activities. It is also important to supervise the implementation of business processes as 
well as the creation and implementation of work plans in accordance with the Standard Operational Procedures. The 
ABMS has been just in recent few years if we consider all subsidiaries and the company itself. Hopefully the future 
research can be done by deepening the research exploration so that the research can contribute into consideration in 
recommendations for system improvements related to the implementation of the anti-bribery movement

Abstract 
Nowadays, a lot of businesses acknowledge how online forums have grown and successfully demonstrated to get 
closer to their market. Virtual social networks are still a powerful tool for businesses to enhance client trust and 
purchasing flow. This connection encourages the customer to spread more favorable word of mouth about the business, 
especially online. This study investigates the impact of Positive EWOM and Virtual Social Networks (VSN) on 
purchase intention. Using purposive sample and 200 respondents to reflect the entire user base, this study was 
conducted in Indonesia in the context of online shopping initiatives based on customers' opinions. With the use of 
AMOS, the data is analyzed using structural equation modeling. The result shows that VSN brings a significant and 
positive impact on trust and time flow. Also, there is a substantial and positive impact of EWOM on users’ purchase 
intention.

1. Introduction
People's communication capabilities have improved as a result of recent technological advancements, particularly 
through the internet. The internet has emerged as the most effective and efficient means of connecting people 
throughout the world. Not only do people use the internet to send emails and browse websites, but many businesses 
now use it as a strong marketing tool to promote their goods and services. Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is 
the term used to describe this trade using internet media. The rapid development of trade and communication tools 
results in the emergence of a fiercely competitive market that operates both locally and globally. 
Mortazavi, Esfidani, and Barzoki (2014) report that viewers' intentions to browse online channels are on the rise. 52 
percent of Europeans regularly use their personal computers to get online. Comparatively, 36% of European Internet 
users watch less television, 28% buy fewer newspapers and magazines, and 17% listen to radio rather than surfing the 
web. This position altered as a result of the large-scale marketers that reduced their spending on traditional media in 
2008 since their share of the entire budget was dropping, including print and broadcast media. 
The virtual social network is one of the most significant factors significantly associated to internet usage (VSN). 
According to Lai and Turban's (2008), an online social network is any website where users can create a virtual area 
for themselves. Palmer and Koenig-Lewis (2009) noticed that numerous businesses have created online forums and 
web stores. These results convincingly demonstrate that VSN is unquestionable in the e-commerce industry. 
The availability of word-of-mouth (WOM) communication is also impacted by the development of the internet and 
its users in terms of size and scope. The extensive reach, openness, and accessibility of the internet significantly 
influence consumer spending, trustworthiness, and the WOM idea, which may benefit marketers by enabling them to 
increase their trading activities. Recent trends show that many VSN users are constantly reading reviews of various 
brands and goods. Internet consumers put greater trust in other users' suggestions than they do in online marketing, 
according to research by Barreto from 2013. Additionally, for their marketing objectives, marketers advise using 
indirect marketing techniques like viral marketing, which is anticipated to spread swiftly from one person to another.

the test was significant (H1 accepted). The greater the VSN attribute, the greater the time distortion effect when 
consumer use the website. Moreover, the lower the VSN attribute, the lower time distortion effect when consumer 
using the website. The effect of time distortion on perceived positive eWOM was positive and significant. Because 
the probability value was 0.020 (higher than p 0.05) and the path estimate was 0.144, the testing of the time distortion 
on positive eWOM was shown to be significant (H2 is accepted). When customers enter the website, the favorable 
eWOM is larger the more time has passed. Additionally, when users browse the website, the positive eWOM is lower 
the smaller the time distortion. The effect of VSNs’ attribute on trust was positive and significant. Because the 
probability value was 0.000 (p < 0.05) and the path estimate was 0.747, the testing of the VSNs' attribute on trust was 
found to be significant (H3 accepted). Customers are more likely to trust a website when the VSN is higher. 
Additionally, customers' trust in a website decreases the lower the VSN. The impact of trust on positive eWOM was 
both favorable and significant. Because the probability value was 0.000 (p < 0.05) and the path estimate was 0.629, 
the testing of the trust on positive eWOM was found to be significant (H4 is accepted). When visitors access the 
website, positive eWOM is increased in proportion to their level of trust. In addition, the favorable eWOM when users 
enter the website decreases in direct proportion to trust. Positive and considerable eWOM on purchase intentions in 
VSNs. Because the probability was 0.000 (p < 0,05) and the path estimate was 0.466 in the testing of Positive eWOM 
on purchase intentions in VSNs, it was determined that the results were significant (H5 is accepted).

Abstract 
MCDM techniques are essential for a variety of decision-making tasks. Approaching the difficulty of determining an 
appropriate solution is very challenging and complex since many aspects play a significant role. A novel Measurement 
Alternatives and Ranking (MARCOS) approach for sustainable supplier selection in retail establishments in Morocco 
is proposed in this study. The developed approach has the following advantages: before the development of an initial 
matrix, examination of an anti-ideal and ideal solution, more precision about the concept of usefulness, with 
consideration to both alternative solutions, the development of a new approach to calculate utility functions and the 
potential of considering a broad range of criteria and alternatives while still keeping the stability of the approach. 
Supplier selection is very important for organizations. Sustainability in supplier selection is a major problem for all 
organizations, and supplier selection processes are improperly executed in all areas of activity. And so, this case 
illustrates how to apply the MARCOS methodology to identify sustainable suppliers in the retail sector, which is done 
step-by-step, along with detailed explanations and which takes into consideration the criteria derived from the 
literature.

Abstract 
Employee performances can lead to a better work quality in Small Medium Enterprise (SME) industry which could 
be enhanced by interventions of ergonomics. Ergonomics aims at ensuring a good fit between the workers and their 
work, thus maximizing the worker's comfort, safety and health, productivity and efficiency. This study aims to design 
an ergonomic workstation for cashiers at mini mart. Mini mart is one of a business under Small Medium Enterprise 
(SME). Postural analysis tools which are Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment 
(REBA) were used to determine and evaluate the risks that related to ergonomic risks. Plus, Nordic questionnaire was 
conducted in order to analyze the most painful and uncomfortable body parts of the cashiers. The common ergonomic 
risks and occupational problems of workers in SME industry is Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs). Both RULA and 
REBA score was exceeding the recommended score which RULA score more than 5 and REBA score more than 7. 
The posture of workers need to be investigate soon to minimize the ergonomic risks. An ergonomic workbench is 
suggested for workers to reduce the ergonomic risk and can boost the productivity of workers.

1. Introduction
Ergonomics deals with the application of information about human behavior, capabilities and limitations to the design 
of systems, machines, tools, tasks or jobs and environments for productive, safe and effective human practice (Nag 
2019). The objective of ergonomics is to ensure a good fit between the workers and their job, thus maximizing workers 
comfort, safety and health, productivity and efficiency. Derived from the Greek words ‘ergon’, which means work 
and ‘nomos’, which means laws, ergonomics literally means the laws of the work (Ehrensberger- Dow and 
Jääskeläinen 2019). 
Ergonomics risks are one of the topic that need to be justified in industries because it was often to be heard as favorites 
diseases among workers. One of it is Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) which includes pain, stiffness, joint noises, 
weakness and decreased range of motion. Inflammation may cause pain, warmth, tenderness, impaired function, 
swelling and sometimes redness of the overlying skin (Alexandra 2019). Most of MSD happened because of 
repetitiveness in a single work, excessive vibration and performing work in awkward posture for a long time. 
Most of Small and Medium Industries (SME) companies in Malaysia were not aware with ergonomics on their workers 
and their jobs (Siong et al. 2018). There were many risks that could happen if ergonomics is not being implemented. 
Based on United States Department of Labor, there were thousands of reports and illness that were reported in a year. 
By reviewing the injury reports, it can be concluding that ergonomics were not being implemented by workers during 
their work. 
In Malaysia, ergonomics so far had a little impact because for certain managers in company, ergonomics is not 
considered with performance, but rather with occupational safety and health and legislation (Loo 2012). It is true that 
Department of Safety and Health (DOSH) Malaysia had come with many ideas on how to overcome problems that

days were neck and lower back. Besides, shoulders and ankles/feet were both voted by 1 person. After analyzing the 
results of Nordic questionnaire, the most painful parts that being experienced by the four cashiers for both period of 
time were neck, lower back and ankles or feet can lead into ergonomics risks. Example of Musculoskeletal Disorder 
(MSD) that could be faced by the cashiers were stiffness, muscle strain, vertebral osteomyelitis and spinal fracture. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Small Medium Enterprise (SME) is an important industry in Malaysia’s economy. In order to improve the quality and 
productivity of workers, a specific solution is needed for adjusting the existing work environment at the workstation. 
From this study, a significant observation and analysis found that the cashiers were working in uncomfortable 
conditions and uncomfortable postures, as the study has found. This is because of a lack of education and 
understanding of ergonomics in small medium-scale industry. 
 
Several methods had been done to analyze the working condition of the four cashiers from four different companies. 
The methods include Rapid Upper Limb Assessment, Rapid Entire Body Assessment, Nordic questionnaire, 
anthropometry data and workspace envelope. This study had come out with a new ergonomic workbench for cashiers. 
The purpose was to eliminates or minimize the possibilities of getting ergonomics risks or injuries. Example of 
Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) that could be faced by the cashiers are stiffness, muscle strain, vertebral 
osteomyelitis and slip discs. From this study, the problems that related with ergonomics for the cashiers had been 
identified. Several methods were implemented to discover and analyzed the problems. A new workbench design also 
had been created in order to reduce those problems faced by the cashiers. Ergonomics risks can be reduced by 
implementing ergonomic workbench for workers that could lead to the highest productivity in SME.  
 
The new workbench design needs to be fabricated and tested by the cashiers. This could help in finding the flaws of 
the workbench if it is being tested. Besides that, more workers should be observed and analyzed for their working 
posture for the further studies. It is because the more the respondents in the study, the more information will be 
obtained. 
 
Limitation this study is the anthropometry data and working envelope measurements. These two data should be 
considered to obtain more information on the workstation on the suitability with the cahiers. Besides that, the 
workstation can be design efficiently when the anthropometry and working envelope data taken into account. 
 
Next, all industry should aware with ergonomics risks. The company should give proper briefing and training to 
improve the workers‟ awareness on ergonomics risks. Implementing ergonomic procedure helps to reduce the risk of 
developing Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs). A good culture of safety increases productivity, morale for workers 
and retention for workers. Strong integration in ergonomics prevents injury, and increases productivity. With these 
recommendations, the ergonomics risks in SME industry can be reduced.

Abstract 
The study examines the tertiary students’ preparedness, motivation, internet availability, technical support, and 
psychological support that influence students’ online learning satisfaction in Indonesia. This study was initiated during 
the early Covid-19 pandemic that forced most education institutions to shift to online platforms. Data from 292 
respondents were collected online across Indonesia for three months, from November 2020 until the end of February 
2021. The Structural Equation Model was selected as the primary data analysis method using Smart PLS 3.2.4, where 
five hypotheses were tested in this study. Findings demonstrated that psychological support, motivation, and 
preparedness significantly affected students’ satisfaction. The result of this study contributes to updating the trend 
during the Covid-19 pandemic because there was limited research conducted on this topic, especially in Indonesia. 
However, further study should be able to provide a comparative study between different countries to understand if 
similar factors could have influenced their students’ online learning satisfaction in higher learning institutions, 
especially in the post-Covid 19 eras.

1. Introduction
With the previous Covid 19 pandemic as a decisive push factor, many countries have been forced to implement social 
distancing policies across multiple sectors. This included the closure of offices, businesses, universities, and schools. 
As schools and universities were forced to be closed for physical sessions during this pandemic, over 1.2 billion 
learners in 186 countries were forced to leave their usual classroom settings (Li and Lalani, 2020). Since then, all 
education providers have been forced to push forward with integrating online learning as an alternative to the 
blackboard learning style. From being complementary, online learning has since become the primary medium of 
3071",,"Proceedings of the First Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

The result of three significant factors is relevant to prior research. Gil-Ariase et al. (2020) found that enjoyment as a 
positive psychological state supports students’ satisfaction during their learning. Furthermore, Strigas and Jackson 
(2003) and Johnson et al. (2017) proved that the more motivated the students are, the more satisfied they will be in 
their learning process. Lastly, research by Abdous (2019) indicated that students’ readiness contributes to higher 
outcomes in learning satisfaction. Connecting this result with the pandemic condition is certainly relevant because the 
conditions during a pandemic are unpredictable. Therefore, psychological, motivation and preparation aspects are 
important to consider. 
 
Although internet availability was proven a significant factor for students’ satisfaction during their learning in previous 
research by Apuke and Iyendo (2018) and Allo (2020), this factor does not demonstrate the impact on students’ 
satisfaction in Indonesia. This contradiction could be resulted from the Indonesian government's intervention in 
providing free internet access for students (Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology of Indonesia, 
2021). Therefore, most Indonesian students during the pandemic generally accept that the availability of the internet 
is no longer an essential factor in their learning program. 
 
Although the pandemics condition is predicted to get better and now moving to an endemic era, the trend to rely on 
online learning remains unchanged shortly. Formal or informal education may continue to utilize online learning in 
combination with face-to-face learning. Therefore, future research can focus on designing a proper learning process 
that combines both online and offline methods because the online delivery during the pandemic was not designed for 
online learning (Baber, 2020). It should be modified to the students’ condition to increase their satisfaction.

Abstract 
Fatigue was identified as a contributing factor to accidents in the rail sector. Fatigue can be caused by a lack of quantity 
and poor quality of sleep due to split sleep. Split sleep is common in train operations because of the limited rest time. 
At that time, train drivers had to sleep, pray, contact family, and commute. This study aims to examine the effect of 
split sleep on driving fatigue. Fatigue was measured based on the blink duration and frequency through an eye tracker 
and subjective questionnaires, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Nine 
participants underwent two sleep conditions, namely split sleep and consolidated sleep. Split sleep divides sleep into 
two segments at 05.00–10.00 and 12.00–15.00. Meanwhile, consolidated sleep is carried out continuously at 05.00–
13.00. Participants were asked to drive a train simulator for 2.5 hours in the laboratory after each sleep state was 
executed. From this study, it was concluded that there were significant differences in the conditions of split sleep and 
consolidated sleep. This is caused by increased fatigue based on the blink duration and frequency. However, the KSS 
and VAS data did not show any difference between the two sleep conditions. Therefore, split sleep can be carried out 
if needed by maintaining the quality and duration of sleep. Improving sleep quality and fulfilling adequate sleep 
duration (7–8 hours) is carried out as a mitigation strategy to reduce the effect of fatigue due to split sleep. In addition, 
comfortable lodging in train station can support improving the quality and fulfillment of sleep duration.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Fatigue has been identified as a contributing factor to accidents, injuries, and death under various conditions
(Williamson et al., 2011). These conditions include the field of transportation where fatigue is an important issue for
safety (Dawson et al., 2014). Gander et al. (2011) define fatigue as the inability to function in desired conditions. This
is due to a lack of rest from previous work and activities. Meanwhile, Dawson et al. (2014) define fatigue as sleepiness
that drives a person to sleep. Fatigue has a strong relationship with an increased risk of accidents (Williamson, et al.,
2011). In fact, fatigue is recognized internationally as a fundamental safety issue in the rail sector (Dorrian et al.,
2006). Train accidents caused by fatigue are included in factors related to humans which is train driver. Iridiastadi and
Ikatrinasari (2012) investigated 72 factors that are closely related to train accidents in Indonesia. The results showed
that the biggest cause of accidents is ‘preconditions for unsafe acts’. Preconditions for unsafe acts include boredom
felt by train drivers due to delayed schedule and fatigue before work. In addition, the report found the train drivers
were sleepy and asleep before the accidents occurred.
In driving activities, sleep is one of the factors that is closely related to fatigue. Sleep deprivation, sleep restriction, 
and sleep disturbances can cause fatigue (May and Baldwin, 2009). Many studies have concluded that sleep restriction 
and sleep deprivation contribute to fatigue leading to incidents (Williamson et al., 2011). Kwon et al. (2019) also state 
that limited sleep duration and poor sleep quality can increase the risk of fatigue. Fatigue related to sleep is an issue 
that occurs in the railway sector in Indonesia. Train drivers do not get optimal sleep duration because they have to 
drive for a long time. For example, in the operation of a freight train, the travel time of a train can reach 4-5 hours

and wake up. The RFM used by PT KAI is quite good, it is just that PT KAI needs to re-validate the fatigue 
threshold used. 
 
5.3 Limitations 
This study has limitations on the use of simulators and the fatigue factor studied. The experiments carried out in this 
study used a simulator and a train driver’s cabin in the laboratories which was made according to real conditions. The 
simulator used has low fidelity so it cannot represent the conditions in the field as a whole. However, studies have 
proven that experiments with train simulators under monotonous conditions are more sensitive to the effects of sleep 
deprivation (Dunn and Williamson, 2012). This is confirmed by the research of Philip et al. (2005) who concluded 
that there was no significant difference in fatigue levels between the use of simulators and real driving. 
In addition, only two fatigue factors were studied, sleep conditions and driving duration. Williamson et al. (2011) 
mentioned other factors such as time of day and time awake. On the other hand, May and Baldwin (2009) state that 
fatigue can be caused by work factors, such as mental stress. Time of day, time awake, and work factors were not 
studied in this study, so further research is needed. 
6. Conclusion 
This study concludes that split sleep has an effect on fatigue in train driving activities. This is indicated by the higher 
duration and blink parameters in split sleep than in consolidated sleep. The statistical test results also stated that the 
two sleep conditions differed significantly based on the blink parameters. However, the results of subjective 
measurements based on KSS and VAS values did not show a significant difference in the two sleep conditions. 
However, split sleep still has an effect to fatigue so this condition is not recommended. 
 
If the split sleep must be maintained due to the limitations of the train driver's work schedule, the effect of split sleep 
on fatigue can be reduced by mitigation strategies. The mitigation strategy that can be done is improving sleep quality 
and fulfilling sleep duration for 7-8 hours in the 24-hour period before driving. Improving the quality and duration of 
sleep needs to be supported by comfortable sleeping facilities. Comfortable sleeping facilities include a cool room 
temperature, minimal lighting, and a noise level of less than 30 dB.

Abstract 
This paper aims to analyze whether family control and good governance affect firm performance. This model is 
developed based on the agency view and stewardship perspective. It uses a sample of 71 manufacturing companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for 2017-2019, resulting in 213 observations. The data is analyzed 
based on panel data regression and moderated regression analysis. Our findings suggest that there is a positive and 
significant effect of corporate governance on a company's performance. These effects are weaker when firms have a 
higher level of family control. It might be indicated that the selected directors are not based on competence and only 
on family relationships which will negatively affect the management's decision.

Corporate Governance, Family Control, and Firm Performance. 
1. Introduction
Financial performance is one of the critical factors that must be maintained by the company so that investors are 
interested in continuing to invest in that company. Management's ability to increase shareholder value will go hand in 
hand with rising share prices. In addition, cooperation between agents and principals in making decisions will increase 
company value (Onasis and Robin, 2016). In many developing countries, owners of family companies will choose 
people from their own families or relatives to be appointed board members in their companies, including in Indonesia, 
where most companies are owned by families (Rashid, 2018). Based on a survey from Price Waterhouse Cooper 
(PwC) published in CNN Indonesia, it is stated that more than 95% of companies in Indonesia are family-owned 
businesses (Supriadi, 2014).  
In applying the concept of good corporate governance in the Indonesian state, institutional elements are expected to 
provide a maximum contribution, namely independent commissioners and independent directors. The existence of an 
independent board brings objectivity in ensuring interests beyond the interests of shareholders (Bohorquez, Ferrero 
and Sánchez, 2018). The function of the audit committee that assists the board of commissioners in overseeing the 
company running on an ongoing basis can improve the integrity of financial reporting. The existence of an audit 
committee can also reduce illegal actions in the form of fraud or falsification by management in financial reporting 
(Hundal, 2013). Onasis and Robin (2016) concluded that independent commissioners positively affect company 
performance and the audit committee has a positive effect on financial performance.  
1.1 Objectives  
This study aims to analyze the effect of governance on company performance by using the ratio of independent 
commissioners and the number of audit committees. In addition, this study adds family control as a moderating 
variable of the relationship between governance and company performance because most companies in Indonesia 
are family companies. 
2. Literature Review
Agency theory is a corporate governance concept that regulates the relationship between principals and agents (Anand, 
2007). Principal in managing his company assigns duties and responsibilities to agents. Jensen and Meckling (1976) 
define the agency relationship as a contract between the principal and the agent, emphasizing that the agent should 
make each decision on behalf of the principal's interest. Rashid (2018) argue that there will be unavoidable conflicts

6. Conclusion
This study aims to determine the effect of corporate governance on company performance with family control as a 
moderating variable. The main findings are that corporate governance positively and significantly influences the 
company's performance. Independent commissioners and audit committees are essential in creating good corporate 
governance by reducing agency conflict. Family control proxied by family directors weakens corporate governance's 
positive influence on firm performance. It indicates that if the selected directors are not based on competence and only 
on family relationships will negatively affect the company's management.

Abstract 
Staff turnover has a negative impact on an organization's progress and development. Unfortunately, companies 
commonly experience difficulty replacing departing employees with qualified applicants that fit their job 
specifications. Staff turnover is influenced by the recruitment and selection process, and effective recruitment and 
selection reduce employee turnover, which boosts an organization's profitability. Therefore, organizations must 
consider getting competent people that fit the company's job specifications from the beginning of the recruitment 
process, demonstrating the importance of a well-organized and methodical hiring process. This article presents an 
assessment model to rank the applicants for research and development job positions in a company. The methods 
used in this model are the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (F-AHP), Alfares' weighting method, and Fuzzy 
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (F-TOPSIS). The selection criteria for research and 
development job positions were classified into subjective, objective, and absolute factors and customized for PT 
ABC. The expert provided his judgments on the importance of the criteria in fuzzy pairwise comparisons, and the 
criterion weights were determined using F-AHP. The objective criteria weights were: education 0.039, working 
experience 0.083, analysis ability 0.274, research ability 0.290, and planning ability 0.312. At the same time, the 
subjective criteria weights were: interpersonal skills 0.267, software mastery 0.229, problem-solving ability 0.212, 
English fluency 0.053, and the weight of project management ability 0.239. The Alfares method will be used to 
weigh the sub-criteria. The criteria/sub-criteria and their weights will be used in the assessment model for ranking 
the candidates in the research and development job to rank potential applicants using the F-TOPSIS method.

1. Introduction
Employee turnover is the shifting of workers throughout the labor market between enterprises, occupations, and states 
of employment and unemployment (Al-Suraihi et al. 2021). Staff turnover has a substantial impact on an organization 
since it can have a negative effect on its productivity, sustainability, competitiveness, and profitability (Girish 2011). 
In addition, staff turnover is costly from an organization's perspective due to the replacement costs for new employees. 
For employees to be replaced productively, the firm must recruit and train new employees (Kessler 2021). Turnover 
can negatively impact the organization's remaining employees since they must divide their time between training new 
employees and executing their regular duties, resulting in lower efficiency and productivity (Saraih et al. 2016). In 
addition, customers will be served by new personnel who are less knowledgeable and have less expertise than their 
predecessors and are consequently less understanding of the organization's and customers' goals (Holtom and Burch 
2016). Appropriate recruitment and selection processes influence employee attrition, which boosts a firm's 
profitability (Hossain et al. 2015). Therefore, businesses must think about how to find qualified people who match 
their job requirements from the start of the recruitment process, highlighting the significance of a well-organized and 
methodical hiring process. 
Since there are so many different areas of expertise, companies must define the proper selection criteria for each field 
of work, including Research and Development (R&D). R&D is a crucial component of a company's success, especially 
in light of the considerable changes in the competitive environment since the 1990s (Chiesa et al. 2009). R&D is 
significant for a company to improve the quality of its products and to support the management staff of the organization

6. Conclusion  
In this study, a multi-criteria assessment model was developed that would enable an organization to reduce staff 
turnover by implementing a well-organized and structured recruitment process.  Subjective and objective criteria for 
the R&D field derived from a previous study have been adapted to the PT ABC condition and resulted in five criteria 
for each. The weights of the criteria were established using the F-AHP method, while the weights of the sub-criteria 
were obtained using the Alfares method. Finally, F-TOPSIS was used to calculate the closeness coefficient, and the 
applicants were ranked as follows: A2 in position 1, followed by A5, A1, A4, and A3. 
 
7. Future Research 
The multi-criteria assessment method can use methods other than the existing methods in this research, and the 
company can set new subjective and objective weights according to future needs. Finally, another form of assessment 
for the model application can be used.

The current condition is a tough test for entrepreneurs, including micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). In 
order for businesses to survive, they must be able to adapt quickly, innovate, such as changing marketing patterns and 
changing products. Companies large and small have enormous pressure on new products to be developed. This is due 
to the increasing competition and the rapid development of the industry (Hobday 1998; Katzy et al. 2013). According 
to Hobday (1998), the complexity and cost of a product have an important role in product innovation and coordination 
in the industry. Coordination between the external and internal environment of a company increases drastically in 
order to gain knowledge. This knowledge is then used for the development of a company's innovation (Mostaghel et 
al. 2019). Internal coordination between marketing functions (Henard and Szymanski 2001; Swink and Song 2007)

by marketing parties or from MSME supply chain partners. The information must contain novelty and interesting 
elements to contribute to the creation and development of new products. Thus, MSME's innovative products can offer 
completely new features and benefits for consumers compared to their competitors. This will increase consumer 
interest in MSME innovative products which has an impact on improving MSME product innovation performance. 
 
This study has several limitations. First, the research focuses on MSMEs. Future research can examine really large 
companies and perhaps the impact of manufacturing coordination and intelligence quality will be more visible than in 
MSMEs. Second, this research focuses on the manufacturing sector. Future research can investigate non-
manufacturing sectors such as service companies. Third, this research is quantitative. Further researchers can use 
qualitative methods with the same context or even by adding some constructs such as the use of technology to obtain 
more complex and in-depth results. 
 
The results of this study provide managerial contributions to MSMEs in product development, to improve 
manufacturing coordination with the market as well as manufacturing coordination with the supply chain and the 
quality of market intelligence and the quality of supply chain intelligence. When these things can be continuously 
improved, the performance of product innovation owned by MSMEs or companies will also continue to increase and 
will bring long-term benefits and competitive advantages for the related companies.

Abstract 
Indonesia is in the top ten country with the largest forest around the world in 2020. Based on information, the total 
production of logs in Indonesia is 64.42 million. The development of the wood industry is increasing along with the 
increasing population. The presence of waste from the production can not be used optimally. the production of 
furniture made from wood waste has basically been carried out. However, it have not known yet for the acceptance of 
these products in consumers. This research aims to model the acceptance of the use of household furniture made from 
wood scrap using SmartPLS. The indicators used in this research have not yet focused on consumer assessment of the 
characteristics of each product, both those using solid wood and products using wood scrap. So that the acceptance 
model in this research only focuses on consumer ratings of the two products in general perceived..

1. Introduction
According to information from Forestry Statistics of Indonesia, In 1997-1998, total sawn timber production reached 
2.6 million cubic meters per year. In 2020, total production nearly reached 2.6 million cubic meters, which means that 
the need for original wood is still very high, while the total forest area in Indonesia continues decrease. The results of 
quarterly forestry data collection shown, total log production in Indonesia is 64.42 million meters cubic. All types of 
logs have increased every quarter. In total, log production in Indonesia increased from the first quarter (14.24 million) 
to the fourth quarter (18.06 million).

two methods only analyze at the latent variable level (unobserved), while the analysis using the SEM method can 
analyze more deeply because the analysis is carried out on each question value contained in each research instrument 
variable. 
 
4. Data Collection 
This research data collection was carried out within one week, then the survey data adequacy test was carried out 
according to the Structural Equation Modeling method. The lowest ratio per observed variable, namely 5 respondents, 
will be sufficient for a normal distribution when there are several indicators for each variable (Gunanti, 2010). This 
statement is also found in several other references, such as the statement (Memon, et al, 2020) that the minimum ratio 
cannot be less than 5 for each statement. This research has 21 observable variables that explain 6 latent variables. So 
that the minimum number of samples needed is 105 (5 x 21 = 105). The number of samples in this research was 216, 
so this number was considered sufficient for this research. 
 
The results obtained from distributing the questionnaires showed that man and woman respondents were almost equal, 
namely 51% for men and 49% for women. This is because the criteria specified in the filling are respondents who 
have experience buying furniture or are married. So that the resulting data is distributed fairly balanced. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Respondent demography (gender) 
 
The respondents who filled out this questionnaire had a fairly diverse age range, namely 35% (Figure 2) were in the 
age range 25-35 years, 26% were in the age range 36-45 years, 25% were in the age range 46-55 years (Figure 2), and 
there were respondents with an age range under 25 years and over 55 years. This is because, the experience of buying 
furniture does not require that someone is married and or someone who is married is not always in the same age range. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
The specification of the structural model is the definition of the correlation between one latent variable and another 
latent variable. Meanwhile, path diagram is a combination of measurement model and structural model. In the model 
specification, the initial step is to specify the measurement model. This model consists of latent variables and observed 
variables, as well as the correlation of the two types of variables. specifications of the SEM model in research as 
explained in the previous chapter which explains the variables and indicators. In this case, the indicators in the table 
are the observed variables and the variable column is the latent variable. In this research there are 21 variables were 
observed. The following is an initial research model on the factors that influence the acceptance of household furniture 
made from scrap wood.

Abstract 
The industry is growing rapidly by combining digital technology and the internet with traditional industries, and 
industrial production capacity is also increasing during the digitization process. Demand for sugar in Indonesia is 
increasing every year in line with the increasing population and the growth of the food and beverage industry, 
assuming a projected population growth of around 1.25 per cent and the growth of the food and beverage industry by 
5-7 per cent per year. The more logistics needed to boost speed without sacrificing precision, the higher the demand.
This study discusses the loading dock process and the required lead time. Then it focuses on maximizing the loading
process time by processing the loading registration process with a digitalization application at a refined sugar company
in Indonesia. Implementing QR codes can speed up the delivery of information and data reports. It can cut down on
time wastage by 66 minutes.

Introduction
In Indonesia, sugar distribution involves several partners, including sugar cane producers, sugar factories, distributors, 
merchants, consumers, and governments. Sugar availability in the market is the distributor's responsibility to serve 
various regions; thus, a high service level in the distribution process is required. On the other hand, distributors must 
examine the sugar factory's production rate, demand changes, and volume to deliver a timely response. Distributors 
must also reduce the cost of sugar storage (Lee, 2006). Demand for sugar in Indonesia is increasing every year in line 
with the increasing population and the growth of the food and beverage industry, assuming a projected population 
growth of around 1.25 per cent and the growth of the food and beverage industry by 5-7 per cent per year. The 
involvement of multiple parties may increase the possibility of inefficiencies in the distribution process. Profits and 
service response will suffer as a result of this inefficiency. As a result, it is critical to reducing wasting time in physical 
or administrative procedures, which was addressed in this study using value stream mapping, or VSM.  
The improvement of logistics service performance service levels was made possible by VSM. The adoption of VSM 
helps identify ineffective logistics procedures in a convoluted supply chain. A group of tools and techniques known 
as lean manufacturing are used to create corrective action plans, decrease waste in manufacturing processes, and 
enhance working conditions. Businesses can design the finest strategies for surviving the current economic crisis with 
the help of the advantages of creating and strengthening lean manufacturing via consistent efforts. Several researchers 
are working to reduce waste by employing the ECRS approach.  
The industry is growing rapidly by combining digital technology and the internet with traditional industries, and 
industrial production capacity is also increasing during the digitization process. Digitization makes information more 
accessible anywhere, anytime, in any context, and for any user using any device or access. The development of 
digitalization has resulted in changes in the logistics sector, creating a connected, highly efficient, and transparent 
digital logistics ecosystem. Adopting the electronic Kanban, a Quick Response (QR) code to each registration and 
other administrative activities in the loading process.

6. Conclusions 
Implementing QR codes in administrative services has many benefits, including the ability to reduce data input errors 
and speed up the sugar loading process, can help to identify a lack or excess quantity of goods, know the type of 
product, feasibility, and quality of the goods to be shipped, reduce human errors in goods inspection, use less paper, 
and expedite the issuance of the manifest for shipping. Additionally, QR codes can speed up the delivery of 
information and data reports. The system will be automatically updated in real-time with information from the Order 
Processing, Truck Weighing, Outbound Checking, Loading, and Stock Take / Opname to ensure that the data obtained 
is accurate. Thus, adding QR codes to the logistical management system can improve sugar-loading efficiency. To 
improve the efficiency of the logistics process, the warehouse must integrate this QR code technology into its logistics 
management system.

Abstract 
In this paper we study the correlation between a decision-making lab experiment on a simple supply chain setting and 
several personality traits of the decision makers which are measured using out-of-experiment surveys. We consider a 
scenario of a single manufacturer interacting with a single retailer who faces a newsvendor problem. The manufacturer 
determines the wholesale price, and the retailer determines the order quantity of the product with random consumer 
demand. We investigate the effects of self-esteem, regret tendency, (lack of) risk/loss aversion, and (lack of) inequity 
aversion on manufacturer’s pricing decisions, and retailer’s order quantity decisions. Despite the small sample sizes 
of the experiment our findings indicate that there is evidence for correlation between these personality traits and the 
contracting decisions of the subjects.

1. Introduction
Aligning the objectives of the supply chain partners and helping them achieve optimal supply chain profit by 
eliminating inefficiencies such as double marginalization has been the objective of many researchers. Various 
alternative contract schemes have been proposed to allocate risk and profit between partners in order to coordinate the 
supply chain. In the last two decades with the rise of behavioral operations management, researchers have also focused 
on the practical performance of these contracts and how human decision makers behave in strategic contracting 
environments. And as such, these studies have revealed that in practice decision makers are not self-regarding, rational 
profit maximizers. Therefore, additional behavioral studies are needed first to understand the factors causing this gap 
between theory and practice as it results in significant suboptimalities, and second to alleviate and eventually eliminate 
this gap. 
In this paper our objective is to study the relationship between supply chain contracting behavior and several different 
personality traits; namely self-esteem, regret tendency, and inequity aversion. We aim to investigate if these traits of 
the decision maker can provide us with a prediction of their behavior in a strategic supply chain environment. The 
ultimate goal, though beyond the scope of this paper, is to remedy the behavioral suboptimalities in supply chains by 
addressing the root causes directly. If a correlation between these personality traits and contract decisions can be 
shown, hopefully by training the decision makers or counselling them, these traits can be managed, and contract 
performance of the decision maker can be improved.  
The study presented in this paper is derived from Akbay’s (2016) doctoral dissertation with never-before-published 
analyses and figures. Akbay (2016), and thus the current paper, is the first, and to this date the only, authentic research 
to consider the behavioral effects of self-esteem and regret tendency, as well as inequity aversion on supply chain 
contracting decisions and to investigate the relationship between these traits and contacting behavior using an out-of-
experiment survey.

5. Conclusion
In this study we examine the correlation between self-esteem, regret tendency, lack of risk/loss aversion, lack of 
inequity aversion and supply chain contracting decisions. Our findings show that there is some weak directional 
support for the hypotheses about the effect of self-esteem, regret tendency and lack of risk/loss aversion. Some of our 
hypotheses are rejected by the data. Here, we must note that the study is conducted with a limited number of subjects; 
there were 22 manufacturer-retailer pairs in this study. This sample size is quite small for comparisons we attempted 
to do in this paper. As a matter of fact the sample sizes in a similar study about newsvendor behavior conducted by 
Akbay(2016) is much larger and they were able to obtain significant results in their analyses. Hence a further study 
with a larger sample size seems necessary in order to come up with more definite conclusions. Nevertheless we believe 
with this study we made an important contribution to the behavioral operations study.

Abstract 
One of the great problems faced by organizations worldwide is how to guarantee sufficient production capacity to be 
able to respond efficiently, effectively and effectively to the demands of the different social interest groups that benefit 
from the supply of goods and / or services manufactured by them.  Understood capacity as the rate of production that 
is expected to be achieved and defined this variable with the main responsible for organizations remaining in force 
within the productive context, since what is not produced is not sold. Taking into account the above, it is necessary to 
operationalize in organizations, methodologies that allow in the long, medium and short term to define in advance the 
behavior of production capacity and thus prepare organizations to face the high levels of variability faced by 
companies in terms of market behavior. Thus, in the present work we develop a process of planning the Capacity of 
Servuccion in the medium term in an organization of specialized medical services (Outpatient Consultation), based 
on the aggregate planning of production and operations, also known as sales and operations planning, in which from 
the development and / or analysis of pure and combined strategies supported in heuristic techniques developed,  it is 
intended to help organizations with similar characteristics, within the economic context where they operate, have 
sufficient resources, capable of responding to such demands at the lowest possible cost.

1. Introduction
When we talk about Servuccion, we refer to systems of manufacture of services of very high complexity where there 
is usually direct interaction of the client, his need and the production process through the human agent or personal 
contact, as it happens in the processes of external consultation, in which the doctor specialist patient relationship 
determines the success of the act of production of health services (Garzon Saenz & Redchuk , 2021).

6. Conclusion
Through the development of this work, it can be concluded that: 
•
In the case of health services, it could be said that they behave deterministically, since their daily production
process has the clarity of how many patients they will attend, which allows them to somehow observe some
stability in terms of sales behavior and this in turn allows the use of linear regression techniques as observed
in the case study and especially in the context of the external consultation, with the certainty of obtaining
successful results that allow for adequate capacity planning.
•
As for capacity analysis, it is impossible for the organization to develop a process with a single medical
specialist.  Since the offer characteristics defined by the IPS require a wide variety of specialists as of today,
21 are available.
•
It should be noted that from the strategy of fluctuation of demand and the analysis of capacity proposed in
scenarios 1 and 2, it could be inferred that the institution under study could function adequately with fewer
specialists, efforts should be focused on looking at the possibility of making stable contracts with the required
medical specialists and in turn organize a good scheme of scheduling shifts or schedules that allow good
availability for the attention to the population demanding the medical services offered by the institution.

Abstract 
Last March 2019, Philippines suffered the first wave of COVID-19 resulting in most, if not all, educational facilities 
seizing operations and swiftly shifting into the online learning environment most of us are familiar with. Currently, 
the Technological Institute of the Philippines Quezon City (T.I.P QC) has adapted into more flexible learning 
approaches as the threat of COVID-19 slowly dwindles away. With the standard learning approach shifting once again 
into the new normal, this study aims to explore the effects and impacts of a once again new modality of learning to a 
graduating engineering student’s academic performance. COVID-19 has caused significant changes in how instructors 
impart knowledge and how students interact with Higher Education (HE). Different teaching and learning approaches 
have been adopted to account for social exclusion, learners' varied requirements, and the fact that they may live far 
from the HE classroom. HyFlex is one such mode. In HyFlex, instructors instruct learners simultaneously in a physical 
classroom and synchronously online using video-conferencing tools. In this small-scale exploratory study, graduating 
students who took a six-week course through HyFlex are interviewed about their experiences and opinions. Despite 
communication difficulties between students who attended through various modalities, individuals did value the 
freedom it provided, according to the findings. The use of several aspects of video conferencing software and other 
digital tools was considered crucial to HyFlex's effectiveness. A quantitative study was conducted using a 
unidimensional 4-point Likert scale questionnaire disseminated through a google form link. Respondents are limited 
to 50 Graduating Engineering Students of T.I.P. QC Campus. Survey results are further validated through the use of 
frequency, percentage, weighted mean, T-test, Standard Deviation, interpretation, and ranking.

Abstract 
This work  study two similar and competing tools for creating games, using Unity and Unreal Engine Development 
(UDK) as a comparison, through Nielsen's 10 (ten) heuristics, for your evaluation, this article being of Human 
Computer Interaction, to help the analysis of heuristics, the MCDA Macbeth methodology was used, and the scores 
of both tools were balanced. With a difference of only 5 points, while the Unity tool had 209 points, the UDK tool 
had 214 points. The Macbeht Methodology predicts the comparison of each one of the 10 heuristics against all the 
others, indicating binarily which one is the most important, always assigning 1 the most important between the two in 
comparison and zero the least important. Then the sum is made and the highest score is assigned Very strong, followed 
by Fleet, Weak and Very Weak, establishing intermediate ranges of points. So after this calibration and summation, 
there was a difference of 5 points only between the two tools. So it can be concluded that both Unity and UDK tools 
are great tools for game development, each tool has its purpose and function, excelling in specific things, but in 
general, they are very similar. Unity is aimed at the more lay user and the UDK is aimed at professionals in the area, 
with both tools operating in the same market segments.

1. Introduction
There was a growing demand for developing new games, many companies were created to meet this market need. 
And for such promotion, many tools made available for the business model were available for the user model. Often 
free, or being free to some extent. 
According to Brazil, Agência (2019) the games sector reached 1.5 billion dollars in Brazil alone. With a growth of 
around 5% predicted until 2022, according to PwC, revenues could rise from $324 million dollars to $878 million 
dollars for the year 2022. Only with mobile games, according to PwC.

which initially will not be used by its users. 
9) Help users to recognize, diagnose and recover from errors: Both tools work with similar models, informing the
error and the location where the error occurred, through a console window.
10) help and documentation: unity works with the idea of providing all the necessary material for your tool, from
tutorials, articles, projects, etc. Unreal has the necessary documentation for its use but on a smaller scale compared to
Unity.
5.4 Validation  
For additional validation, it is proposed to increase the number of people evaluating the two software Unity and Unrea 
UDK.  
6. Conclusion
The analysis of the 10 heuristics proposed by Jakob Nielsen were achieved in this article, thus managing to verify 
differences between two software for game developing. Unity, through MacBeth's heuristic, acquires a total of 209 
points, in contrast to Unreal UDK acquires a total of 214 points, showing a balance between the two tools.  
Both Unity and Unreal UDK tools are great tools for game development, each tool has its purpose and its function, 
standing out in specific things, but overall, they are very similar. Unity is aimed at the most lay user and Unreal UDK 
for professionals in the area, both tools being active in the same market segments

Abstract 
In order to perform a heuristic analysis on two information sites in the fight against coronavirus, the search criteria 
and analysis methods were taken from the Human Computer Interface discipline, from the Instituto Federal 
Catarinense de Rio do Sul, thus making an analysis as demonstrated by Jakob Nielsen, analyzing its 10 heuristics and 
thus making a comparison between the two websites coronavirus.sc.gov.br and Defesacivil.riodosul.sc.gov.br, 
reaching a result through the analysis with the aid of the Macbeth method. The analysis of the heuristics proposed by 
Jakob Nielsen revealed differences between sites that have the same proposal, which is to inform about the fight 
against the coronavirus, thus keeping the population informed. As can be seen on the website of the municipality of 
Rio do Sul, the defensecivil.riodosul.sc.gov.br won in the comparison of the two websites, having a score of 237 
against 190 of the website of the state of Santa Catarina, the coronavirus.sc.gov.br, also highlighting that the 
municipality's website had the highest score in terms of visibility and correspondence between the system and the real 
world.

1. Introduction
In the 1940s, when the first computers appeared, not everyone could use them. It was necessary to be an expert for 
this. However, over time, the scenario has changed. Computers were gaining popularity among companies and families 
with excellent financial conditions. 
In this context, for the use of computers to be easier, several usability studies were carried out and Nielsen's 10 
heuristics are among the most famous until today. Currently, if we can easily interact with systems, much is due to 
that. Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich proposed, in 1990, these usability heuristics, to be considered in any interface 
development.

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
As can be seen, the website of the municipality of Rio do Sul, the defensecivil.riodosul.sc.gov.br won in the 
comparison of the two websites, having a score of 237 against 190 of the website of the state of Santa Catarina, the 
coronavirus.sc.gov.br, also highlighting that the municipality's website had the highest score in terms of visibility and 
correspondence between the system and the real world. 
Naturally, websites can be improved to meet the demands of the population in a possible new wave of the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
 
5.4 Validation  
For additional validation, it is proposed to increase the number of people evaluating the websites, which are currently 
no longer being updated due to the regression in the number of active cases in the year 2022. As well as the relaxation 
of all health restrictions. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The analysis of the 10 heuristics proposed by Jakob Nielsen were achieved in this article, thus managing to verify 
differences between sites that have the same proposal, which is to inform about the fight against the coronavirus, thus 
keeping the population informed.

Abstract 
The aim of this study was to show what was caused by Covid-19 at all stages of the food supply chain, whose actors 
are: producers, processors, distributors, retailers and consumers. Likewise, it sought to identify the main problems and 
the response actions of each link in the face of the new conditions of the pandemic; for this, a systematic review of 
the literature was carried out, which was based on the collection of knowledge regarding Covid-19 and the food supply 
chain. As a result of this search, 67 papers from reliable databases were collected, databases such as Scopus and Web 
of Science; these papers were considered because they met the stipulated inclusion criteria. The selected papers 
allowed to identify that the main problems in the links are due to the shortage of labor / workforce, difficulty in the 
supply of materials or inputs, lack of transportation to distribute food and products, fluctuation in demand and price 
increases. Regarding the first links, it is identified that the majority of response actions were deeply linked to 
technology, innovation, IoT, automation and optimization, seeking to reduce the involvement of labor; and, in the case 
of the consumer link, the response actions were linked to the use of virtual platforms. These responses were adapted 
in various ways depending on the link, since each of them acted differently to each problem; despite this, the decisions 
to be made should consider the repercussions they would have on the next link.

Abstract 
Engineering professionals work in wide variety of industries and deal with many types of works including design, 
manufacturing, construction, management of products, processes, services, and supply chains considering the effective 
and efficient utilization of resources. Unlike other majors, content of engineering major could be very wide and vast 
and involve day to day real life activities. Engineering students, therefore, need to develop specific types of skillsets 
and prepare themselves for the real workplace. Although there has been increasing emphasis in the universities to 
provide more real-life learning experience to their students, there is a lack of studies on the establishment of 
relationship between students’ career choices and related skills and whether universities are able to provide such skills 
to their students. No recent study in Australia has investigated whether universities are properly equipping their 
students with necessary skills and knowledge with contemporary industries. A sample of mechanical and civil 
engineering students were surveyed using a well-designed questionnaire to address this research gap. Results show 
that engineering students surveyed intend to pursue diversified professions and they require specific set of skills. It 
was found that level of skills achieved by the students widely varied- ranging from 40% to 85%. This study also 
examined the relationships between skill achievement and gender, cumulative GPA, country of origin and engineering 
majors.

1. Introduction
Higher education refers to a continuous process of learning by students in specialised disciplines of a university or 
similar tertiary institute. Academic disciplines are well-versed across universities. Each discipline in arts, business, 
science, and technology designs its own curriculum meeting accreditation requirements for stipulated knowledge and 
skills to be reflected through the graduate attributes of students. Industries create job market for students and make 
critical appreciation of those knowledge, skills, and graduate attributes.  
Students are the primary stakeholders of university education systems. They invest in their education with dual 
objectives, primarily to gather knowledge and skills, and ultimately to find a job in accordance with their career choice. 
Universities in the developed countries like Australia have a formal process of having student evaluation about various

achieved these skills at various levels ranging from 40% to 85%. Only 27% students reported that they achieved 80% 
and above the skills required for their jobs. More than 70% reported that they achieved 60% or lower of these skills. 
The interesting part of the results is that the achievement of skills is influenced by several factors including gender, 
GPA, engineering major, and country of origin. Average skills achievement by male students was 66% compared to 
59% for female students. A direct relationship between cumulative GPA and skill achievement was evident as students 
with average GPA between 4-5, 5-6 and 6-7 have reported to have achieved 61%, 65% and 71% of their expected 
skills. It is interesting, however, females having higher average GPA (5.9) achieved lower level of skills compared to 
their male counterparts (5.8). This discrepancy worth further investigations.  
 
Similarly civil engineering students reported to have achieved lower (60.31%) skills compared to mechanical 
engineering students (65.36%) despite their higher GPA (6.35) compared to their mechanical engineering counterparts 
(5.7). This might be related to their year of study as civil engineering students were 3rd year students while mechanical 
engineering students were from the 4th year cohort. It is expected that by the time they reach final year, they will 
acquire further skills. Interestingly, international students reported to achieve much higher skills (67.81%) compared 
to local Australian students (62.43). Other studies (Karim, 2010b) reported that international students are more regular 
in attending their lectures and tutorials compared to their local counterparts. The difference in skill achievements, 
therefore, can be related to the attendance to teaching and learning sessions.  
 
5. Conclusions 
This paper examined engineering students’ potential career choice decisions and their perception of the achievement 
of the required skills and knowledge in pursuit of their career-choices. Working on the data collected from the 
mechanical engineering and civil engineering students at QUT, Australia, the study finds that mechanical engineering 
students have more diverse career choice decisions than the civil engineering students. Surprisingly, a number of 
students opt for non-mainstream engineering careers.  
 
The results show a varying level of skill achievement for the student surveyed. While only 27% of the respondents 
opined that they achieved 80% or above skills required for the chosen careers, more than 70% reported that they 
achieved 60% or lower of these skills. Interestingly, the skill achievement widely varied across gender, students’ GPA, 
country of origin and engineering major. The results warrant further comprehensive studies to extract key factors 
related to students’ skill achievement. Such findings will help universities in moderating curriculum and student 
support mechanisms to improve students’ knowledge and skills required in pursuit of their career choices. As it is a 
preliminary study with some limitations mentioned above, concrete conclusions cannot be made and/or findings 
cannot be generalized. It is expected that further research in this area will help universities in re-engineering the 
curricula and teaching-learning approaches so that real-life profession-oriented education, knowledge and skills are 
achieved by students during their study. As this study has been conducted on a single university, future research needs 
to be undertaken considering larger sample, in particular on the engineering students of more universities in the state 
or country.

Abstract 
Electric bicycles continue to develop and grow with new designs and technologies to attract customers. With the 
growth of the electric bicycle business as green products, the development of online marketplaces selling electric 
bicycles has also increased in Indonesia. People can buy electric bicycle products easily. The purpose of this study is 
to find out the reasons for the customer in the process of buying an electric bicycle. This study focuses on the interests 
and reasons for buying or not buying an electric bicycle on the online marketplace. This study involved 200 people 
from various cities in Indonesia and the respondents involved were from various backgrounds. This study uses a 
qualitative approach, using open-ended questions through an online survey. Data processing uses coding techniques, 
then qualitative data is quantified for cross-case analysis. The results of the study indicate that most respondents have 
an interest in electric bicycles. Environmentally friendly, practical, and low prices are the main reasons for customers 
to buy electric bicycles. Meanwhile, those who do not want to buy an electric bicycle have reasons such as aspects of 
convenience, electric power and price. This research is useful for developing theories related to marketing and the 
characteristics of electric bicycles. This research can also be useful for manufacturers and sellers of electric bicycles 
to understand market conditions.

1. Introduction
A bicycle that is powered by a battery is referred to as an electric bicycle. Electric bicycles provide a number of 
advantages over conventional bicycles, despite the fact that they look like regular bicycles. Electric bicycles' key 
benefit is how simple it is to move them. Electric bicycles run on batteries and don't require much effort from the user, 
making them more convenient for daily commuting. Electric bicycles are significantly faster than conventional 
bicycles, making them more effective at covering greater distances. 
Electric bicycles play an important role as environmentally friendly vehicles with benefits that can reduce carbon and 
become an important part of urban transportation (Fyhri and Sundfor, 2020; Philips et al. 2022). The use of electric 
bicycles not only benefits the environment, but also comfort and health when riding an electric bicycle (Mueller et al. 
2018). There are so many types of bicycles, ranging from price ranges, technology support and other supporting 
components that make electric bicycles have several categories (Muetze and Tan, 2007). 
Consumer needs for product attributes are one of the factors that influence consumers in deciding to purchase an 
electric bicycle. Starting from the features in electric bicycles, facilities to the broad impact on the environment 
(Bockarjova & Steg, 2014). Research is needed to complete the needs of how to use electric bicycles (Fishman and 
Cherry, 2015). The purpose of this study is to find out the reasons for the customer in the process of buying an electric

From the research results, Table 3 shows the reasons why consumers do not buy electric bicycle products. The first is 
electricity power with 38.1%. For respondents, this is due to the lack of adequate electricity power facilities to support 
the mobility of electric bicycles. In addition, there is a price of 37.5%. This is because the price is more expensive 
than bicycles, but some respondents choose motorcycles because the price is not much different. The third is 
convenience in use by 24.4%, respondents prefer motorbikes directly to get better speed than electric bicycles. The 
results of the study show that there are similarities in the reasons for buying or not buying an electric bicycle. There 
are 2 common factors, namely price and convenience in use. This indicates that these two factors are relative to 
consumers in perceiving electric bicycles both in terms of their function for health, or in terms of the performance of 
electric bicycles, such as the speed and weight of the electric bicycle. 
 
This research has shown how people perceive, in this case the younger generation, the benefits of using electric 
bicycles. In addition, there are determining factors that are reasons for consumers to want to buy an electric bicycle. 
Another important thing is the existence of factors that hinder consumers to buy and use the product. The results 
confirm the results of research conducted by Bockarjova and Steg (2014) regarding consumer preferences for features 
and their impact on the use of electric bicycles. 
 
6. Conclusion  
From the research conducted, the data shows that most participants are interested in electric bicycles. Customers 
usually choose electric bicycles for three reasons: convenience, affordability, and environmental friendliness. People 
who choose not to buy an electric bicycle do so for many reasons, including cost, convenience, and electric power. 
This study is useful for generating theories about the marketing and characteristics of electric bicycles. E-bike 
manufacturers and covers can also benefit from understanding this market dynamics study. This study uses a 
qualitative approach, so that future research can be carried out qualitatively.

Abstract 
The growth of the electric car business in Indonesia continues to increase with many brands offering electric cars as 
an alternative in the choice of car vehicles. The purpose of this study was to obtain data about the design of electric 
cars in Indonesia that are attractive to young people today. This study uses a qualitative approach. The research was 
conducted in the city of Bandung, involving 112 respondents. Data was taken using open-ended questions which were 
processed using 2 coding stages, then cross-case analysis stages, using qualitative data analysis software. The results 
of the study indicate that there are factors that are the reason for the young generation in choosing the design of electric 
cars that currently exist in Indonesia. The data also shows that there are many electric car models that are an option 
for the young generation. This research provides data from the field that is useful for the development of research 
related to electric cars. In addition, for the industry this research is useful to provide a real picture of electric car 
models that attract the young generation.

1. Introduction
Electric car design is an evolutionary form of traditional car models that still use fossil fuels. By using batteries as the 
main source, electric car designs can protect the environment from damage. Electric cars are an option (Abbasi, 2021; 
Jayasingh, 2021). At present the development of electric cars in terms of performance and efficiency continues to 
improve, and the increase in usage continues to increase (Dnishev and Alzhanova, 2016). With its development, 
electric cars can be an option for people who are concerned about the environment. 
In order for consumers to increase their desire to buy electric cars, manufacturers must build trust by providing the 
best information so that their brand is trusted better (Zang et al., 2022). In this research, the aim is to find out about 
the perceptions of the younger generation regarding the electric car's design as an important attribute of the product. 
From previous research (Wijekoon and Sabri, 2021) there is a product attribute classification that is important in 
marketing. To influence how customers can be interested in buying environmentally friendly products, in this case, 
electric cars. This research can provide benefits to electric car manufacturers in Indonesia in preparing key points in 
messages to be conveyed in advertisements. 
2. Literature Review
Overall, electric car design is a very positive development in the automotive world. Streamlined, aerodynamic and 
modern design and advanced technology offer users a better driving experience. In addition, this model also has a 
lower environmental impact, making it a better choice for environmentally conscious consumers (Cheron and Zins, 
1997; Matsumoto et al, 2021). The importance of providing proper information about the advantages and benefits of 
using it can increase the desire of consumers to buy their products (Yang et al, 2020; Zheltukhina et al, 2020). Then,

research is in line with previous studies which focused on the reasons for purchasing environmentally products through 
product attributes and marketing (Zhang and Dong, 2020; Wijekoon and Sabri, 2021). This study clarifies that product 
attributes play an important role as one of the classifications in the purchasing process carried out by companies in 
their marketing. 
6. Conclusion
The survey results show that there is a factor for the younger generation to choose electric vehicle designs that 
currently exist in Indonesia. The data also shows that many electric vehicle models are the choice of the younger 
generation. This study provides data in this area to help develop research related to electric vehicles. In addition, the 
study will help the industry get a better picture of the electric vehicle models that young people are interested in. 
Subsequent research focuses on design details that can affect the convenience of use, purchasing decisions and others.

Abstract 
The recent version of the European Manufacturing Survey (EMS) responses was captured in Finland by asking 
companies' CEOs or cognizant personnel (n=123) to respond. This study aims to report the results of the 
following Development of Competitiveness and Employment Situations (DCES) covering Annual Turnover 
(AT), Number of Employees (NE), Manufacturing Capacity Utilization (MCU), Return on Sales (ROS) 
concerning corporations' operations: Relocation Activities (RAs) converging to Offshoring Manufacturing 
Performance (OMP), Backshoring Foreign Manufacturing (BFM); Offshoring R&D (ORD); and Backshoring 
Foreign R&D (BFRD). The defined research question, ""How do the DCES and RAs relate?"" was answered by 
seeking influences directly for AT and NE corresponding to all RAs positively except negative BFRD. Large 
corporations can be said OMP, but the sample also has smaller companies those that BFM. The reason for 
BFM could be the decreased ROS with a statistically significant negative impact during the COVID-19 fiscal 
year 2021.

5. Conclusions
To answer the first research question, based on the data from the research, companies' production outsourcing 
activities predicted the extent of total employment and competitiveness development outsourcing activities in 
terms of annual turnover, such that medium-sized companies with turnover typically transfer production. At the 
same time, the number of employees refers to reasonably large companies. Concerning the number of 
employees, the reason for moving operations abroad is primarily cheap labor (e.g., China) - but the printouts are 
very cheesy from their consistency, as it is only visible in some companies' manufacturing capacity utilization 
and corresponding returns. Furthermore, this shows that only some things can be successfully carried out in 
domestic markets, i.e., reasonably weak Finnish entrepreneurs offshore their operations abroad because it may 
be more profitable in the light of the research results but resembles a risk-taking. A small signal indicates that 
the production runs fluently and better in foreign operations. When the market is pulling either ostensively or 
performatively led, it appears as positive returns, so the given recommendation from the sample is to move 
operations overseas while keeping the core business innovation in Finland.  
To address the second research question and answer the prospects of companies' backshoring foreign 
manufacturing operations: whereby companies operating in Finland have recorded a response of forced or 
volunteering (not directly measured the cause- or reason) to transfer their business back to domestic trade has 
been processed. At this point, the changes to be announced are expected in the scope of the relocation activities 
operations for the development of employment and competitiveness situations perspective in terms of annual 
turnover positively but not equal statistically. However, in terms of the number of employees, there seems to be 
regularity, meaning that, by and large, companies of the same size belong to a cluster number of employees 
with a fairly strong connection. This cluster is also affected by a small rising production capacity utilization rate 
and negative return sales, statistically significantly showing the reason to move back because production costs 
have increased in the country of production. 
In order to answer the third research question, we discuss the expected total employment of R&D offshoring 
and the extent of transfer measures intended to develop competitiveness in terms of annual turnover, which is a 
fairly positive relationship without equality, i.e., companies have weaker and stronger actors that do not 
outsource R&D. However. It can appear as an ideal model for companies that do not do this. The motivating 
result is that if the company offshores R&D operations, the company has a lot to do with the number of 
employees, so it is worth outsourcing research, but with caution. The justifying factor may be that the company 
wants to increase its small production capacity. 
Finally, let us move on to the strict place exchange fence, the fourth research question, to answer how 
companies' use of backshoring foreign R&D expects the full extent of relocation activities intended to develop 
employment and competitiveness in annual turnover. It gave negative and statistically insignificant results, but 
it is a critical topic of conversation in practice. This means that some small companies are bringing their

businesses back to Finland, meaning that technology is being patriated. However, it also speaks of challenges 
because the number of employees is seen expecting sample's small companies. The negative manufacturing 
capacity utilization appears to be a small cause- or reason for this, whereby the relation to returns is also 
strongly negative due to lacking sales. None of these is statistically a good thing. However, on the contrary, the 
research results show that small entrepreneurs bring their R&D functions back because the offshored 
performance fails to sustain at expected levels.

Abstract 
In Indonesia, farmers often become parties with a weak bargaining position, and usually, they can only get a small 
margin because they often sell their commodity in a raw condition without further process. It is necessary to empower 
the farmers to become also as post-harvest Small and Mid-size Enterprises (SMEs) using new appropriate technology 
to make them enjoy a better margin. Because the appropriate technology is a new one especially for farmers, the 
supply chain for this is still nascent. This paper proposes an early supply chain model with a sustainable manufacturing 
perspective to empower them. The case study was conducted on a community-based farmer of amorphophallus 
oncophyllus sp., (in Bahasa Indonesia called as porang), located in Sukoharjo, Indonesia. Using an appropriate 
technology with a sustainable manufacturing perspective makes a more efficient and sustainable way to process the 
commodity for further products and resulting in cost reduction with better quality. Using this model hopefully will 
make farmers enjoy a proper margin and have better bargaining positions.

Abstract 
The objective of this research is to help the vehicle buyers while deciding of buying a vehicle. This research is based 
on studying and finding out the maintenance index value of a car. Nowadays buying a new car is easier than 
maintaining it but what if we all had an idea of the maintenance cost and the product cost before buying a car. VMI 
or Vehicle Maintenance Index is the value or a score number which will indicate the Number in the aspect of 
Maintenance cost, Depreciation cost and Resale value, So the number will lie between 1 to 10 and on that scale. 
Three Car companies were considered for this research based on the sales of the companies. For calculating or 
justifying the VMI we used Replacement theory based on Cost of asset, Maintenance cost for 5 years with the 
increasing percentage value, the depreciation rates for the cars are kept same as per national insurance depreciation 
rate. Vehicle Maintenance Index. Considering India's car scrapping policy, the mini car has a 15-year lifespan and 
must be replaced within 15 years. Therefore, 15 years it translates to 10 years and gives a certain rating. This rating 
helps customers choose the most durable vehicle and helps them decide when to replace their vehicle. We marked 
the vehicle maintenance metrics for three vehicles on the developed base chart. The car's VMI rating, Make 1, got a 
swap rating of 5, so it got its first podium in year 13. This is acceptable, but now a scenario where both Make 2 and 
Make 3 got an index value of 3. If you dig deeper here, Make 3 has an update year of 10 years, so it would be placed 
third, but Make 2 has an update year of 11 years, so this machine would be placed second to it.

1. Introduction
Making a car purchase decision nowadays is overly complex, especially when it comes to the maintenance, this is 
very important for long term ownership as well as short term ownership. In Short term ownership, an individual 
buys a car and uses it for 3-4 years and then exchanges the cars with new or sells the old car so for him maintaining 
his car is beneficial in the deal of a new car as maintaining good will give low depreciation cost. And for long term 
ownership an individual firstly sees at the maintenance, reliability, and durability of the car, how long the car 
performs best. You have invested lakhs of rupees in your vehicle, so you need to be sure to maintain your vehicle 
properly. This is not the only reason to take regular vehicle maintenance seriously. There are several other factors 
that need to be considered. Extend the Life of Your Vehicle: Just by following the regular maintenance schedule, 
you can keep several vehicle problems at bay.  
When you are traveling in your vehicle, the last thing you want is a car breakdown. Keeping up with the regular 
maintenance schedule can help by preventing costly repairs of the cooling system, transmission system, drivetrain, 
and other components. Preventive car care reduces wear and tear of the engine and other components that extend the

Above Table 9. Gives the data about the Depreciation percentage rate with respective to Age of the Vehicle. As we 
all know when buy a New Car and in a day the Car’s value is depreciated. And as the car ages the value of car is 
also depreciated, exceptional cases are with few vehicles, the rare model or rare make or popularity of the model 
makes the car valuable than its price, but this comes with regular health inspections and certificates. 
 
Resale Value: The selling price of a used car is usually generated through a fair estimation without any 
guesswork considering the depreciation value, overall vehicle condition, among others. More often it is 
seen that the used cars come in good condition, especially those that are sold because of upgrading to a new 
model or driven in the city only. These come as a good deal. 
Several used car sellers are offering the entire process of buying a used model online, from selecting to 
submitting documents and paying the money. With the buyer no longer needing to move around the city to 
finalize the paperwork, especially in the Covid scenario, it becomes hassle-free and safer for them. 
Data 
The data for the calculations is of 5 services i.e., 5 years of vehicle age. So, for the further 10 years of 
maintenance is calculated based on the first five years maintenance cost data. 
The Depreciation rate of the vehicle after 5 years is 50% and after 50%, we assumed that every year 10% 
depreciation rate on the oldest price. The Depreciation rate chart is common for all the cars. 
We gathered Data for this calculation from the data available worldwide. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The main objective of our proposal was to make A vehicle buyer’s life easy, many of us go under the confusion and 
we suffer in deciding. A customer’s Point of view is he/she likes a car but sometimes the car does not satisfy the 
budget, the mileage, the maintenance cost for the vehicle but the good thing is in the market the customer gets many 
more options and he/she can be satisfied. In India, Majority of the people look for better mileage, large space, less 
maintenance cost qualities in a vehicle with minimum purchase or On-road price. 
 
VMI, that needs to be considered while purchasing a new or old model of a Vehicle that can eventually lead to 
Maintenance free or less maintenance vehicle purchase. This approach helped us to make a difference between the 
overall maintenance cost proposed by the Company and the best service cost for overall performance. By conducting 
the survey from 60 people we concluded on a statement about the percentage of people owning Cars as compared to 
non-owners. 
 
Vehicle Maintenance Index number will give us a short idea of how the vehicle will require maintenance in the cost 
aspect and this research will be immensely helpful for new car buyers. So, when we took a survey and analyzed the 
data, we found that the customers in Indian are more over maintenance of the car over the other aspects. So, this 
Vehicle Maintenance Index will help these targeted customers in decision making while buying a Car. 
 
Talking about the future scope, this research will help in comparing Internal Combustion Engine cars and Electric 
Vehicles to give a brief idea that Electric Vehicles will score more in Vehicle Maintenance Index and will convince 
the customers to buy Electric Vehicles over Internal Combustion Vehicles. 
 
Future scope of this research, an online portal would be created were a customer can feed the data like vehicle price, 
maintenance estimated cost given by company, and customer can get the result of year of replacement for the

vehicle and on that basis VMI would be generated which will help the customer to make a right decision while 
buying a vehicle.

Abstract 
Efforts at modernising seaports and improve their operational service efficiencies for competitive advantage have 
remained unabated given the changing demands of shipping customers. To address seaport inefficiencies, most 
advance nations have generally adopted infrastructural and technological upgrades/implementations. However, 
this approach has failed to solve the lingering poor seaport performance in emerging economies, suggesting efforts 
must be directed at other areas to identify and explain the persistent inefficiencies at emerging economies’ 
seaports. This paper therefore examine whether there is a relationship between seaport inefficiency and HRM 
practices of the seaports. The study is based on a case study of the Nigerian seaport, Nigeria being the largest 
economy in Africa. Findings reveal that HRM practices have to be fully aligned with seaport business objectives 
for achieving optimal port competitiveness. Specifically, the Nigerian seaports’ HRM Practices exhibits non-
alignment with the business objectives due to unfair staff recruitment and promotion practices leading to poor 
staff morale, loyalty, commitment and productivity, thereby making the seaports uncompetitive, resulting in 
significant business diversion to neighbouring seaports.

1. Introduction
There have been many challenges facing the users and operators of Nigerian seaports over the years. These include 
corruption, poor management structure and mismanagement (Emeghara et al. 2019); logistics and infrastructure 
deficiencies, regulatory and policy instability and multiple government agencies with overlapping purpose and 
responsibilities (Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) 2018). These have resulted in the seaports’ 
inefficiency manifesting in the form of congestion, shortage of qualified manpower, missing cargo, prolong cargo 
dwell time caused by delay in cargo movement insecurity and illegal charges at the seaports; leading to high cost 
of operations (LCCI 2018). These have led to high cost of trade and undesirable impacts on the competitiveness 
of the seaports (Oruwari 2021), with significant effects on patronage, as cargo meant for Nigerian market are now 
being diverted to neighbouring seaports (Hellenic Shipping News 2020). Given the importance of seaports to the 
national economy and global competition between seaports for patronage, it is very important to identify and 
address the factors impacting seaport competitiveness (SC). 
Despite the high importance of the seaport to the economy and several efforts at modernising the seaport at various 
times by the Nigeria government, Nigerian seaports remain inefficient and struggle to cope with the country’s 
volume of export and imports. Many studies have been conducted to find the root cause of the inefficiency and 
many solution have been recommended based on findings. However, the proffered solutions have failed to solve 
the lingering poor performance of the seaports. This suggest that apart from the challenges associated with poor 
infrastructure and administrative structure, efforts must be directed at other areas to identify and explain the 
persistent inefficiencies at seaports that have defied many solutions. Without proper identification of the key 
underlying issues, no meaningful and/or effective solutions can be found. This study therefore focuses on 
examining whether there is a relationship between seaport inefficiency and human resources management 
practices of the seaports. 
Nigeria being the largest economy in Africa with a GDP of $440.78 billion in 2021 (World Bank (WB) 2022) and 
a very large market with a population of approximately 211 million people in 2021 and a projected population of 
217 million people in 2022, has always been of great economic interest locally and internationally (WB 2022).

When asked to access the reasonableness of overall cost of clearance, a manager from SP5 said: 
 
…the overall charges are attractive and competitive to bring in more customers. If you add 
together all our official charges, they are very modest and affordable for any importer, but they 
complain that extortion from government agencies make overall cost very high (PM2, SP5) 
A manager in SP6 was asked the same question and he responded that: 
These costs are very reasonable, that is, the official ones… There are other illegal and 
unreceipted cost adding to overall clearance cost that are making it to be expensive. (PM3, SP6) 
Proposition Findings 
The findings for the two propositions are presented in Table 5. For P1, there is a relationship between HR and 
WC because generally the status of practices for the variables for both are week. This implies that good HR 
practices consistent with global best practices will positively impact workforce capability building of the seaport. 
 
For P2 there is also an association between WC and SC because practices status for both are weak. This shows 
that if there is good workforce capability building practices, it is expected that the seaport will be competitive and 
vice versa. This implies that a good workforce capability building will translate to competitiveness of the seaport.

6. Conclusion  
There are two broad implications of this study. These are theoretical and practical. Theoretically, there are two 
things it will contribute to literature. First is that investment in HR practices will have significant positive impact 
on workforce capability building in the context of a developing country. The second is that merit-based 
recruitment and promotion is very vital to improving workforce morale, loyalty, commitment, and productivity in 
order to improve seaport competitiveness Practically, there are learnings for the seaport managers to improve the 
competitiveness of seaports. They have to address issues with HR development. They must emphasize merit-
based recruitment and promotion and also address issues with working condition of staff to improve productivity. 
Also, additional provision of modern seaport technology is required. If the issues with HR development and 
practices are addressed, then this can be used as benchmarking for other African seaports to become competitive.   
 
This study has two limitations. The first is that only one variable is considered under HRM practices and SC. 
Other variables could still be included to broaden the scope. The second is that only the views of seaport managers 
were sought during the interview. Views of other seaport stakeholders, such as seaport users and customs 
personnel could be included for triangulation.

Abstract 
Pneumatic conveying of powders is an engineering process used for conveying dry granulate or powder material. The 
aim of this paper is to present a modeling methodology to optimize energy efficiency of pneumatic conveying systems, 
considering the specific bulk characteristics of the product being conveyed. This work is based on engineering 
optimization of a workflow with data from an industrial operation commanded by a Programmable Logic Controller 
(PLC) with a control algorithm, performing logical, sequential, and timed tasks for plant control. The PLC 
communicates with a Human-Machine Interface and a Supervision and Control System, which are the means of 
interaction through a graphical environment interface with the process operator. By applying mathematics to introduce 
a systematic method to select the gas (air) pressure and flow necessary to operate a pneumatic conveying system in 
dense phase, it has been shown, on an industrial scale, the feasibility of controlling a conveying system by 
manipulating only two input parameters. This allows operation at pre-determined conveying rates with lower power 
requirements, resulting in a reduction of OPEX. Thus, this research focuses on optimizing energy efficiency to reduce 
Operational Expenditure (OPEX) through a systematic modeling approach. Because pneumatic conveyance is highly 
empirical, general models are difficult to establish. Due to these limitations, evaluating energy efficiency is usually 
limited to a specific experimental range of conditions. This methodology can be adapted to enhance the energy 
efficiency of other types of pneumatic conveying systems.

Abstract 
Trucking holds most of the Indonesian transportation market share; thus, research in this sector is critical. It is essential 
to know the differences between the least and the top performance Indonesian trucking companies, yet not many 
studies brought up a comparative analysis between the least and top performers in trucking industries. This research 
will search for similarities and differences between the least and top performer trucking companies in terms of 
resilience factors affecting company resilience and performance, draw a linkage for the impact of COVID-19 on 
company performance and find the correlation between company resilience and performance. An in-depth literature 
review was done to define the research gap, the constructs, and the indicator, which was then converted into 
questionnaires. These questionnaires were distributed to Indonesian trucking companies that consist of trucking 
carriers, couriers, third-party logistics, factories, and distributors that own trucks. These data are further analyzed 
through SEM PLS Algorithm. This research found that the impact of COVID-19 affects both groups. The least-
performing companies mainly emphasize financial resources management and company relationship management to 
enhance company resilience, and the effect of innovation in digitalized technology directly correlates to company 
performance. 
Keywords 
Adaptability and flexibility, Risk and business continuity management, and Company performance. 
1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant impact on the global economy, and SMEs are classified as one of the 
sectors that are highly affected by this disruption (Jedynak and Bak, 2021). Shen et al. (2020) reported that catering, 
tourism, entertainment, and transportation are sectors that experienced a tremendous hit during the Pandemic of 
COVID-19. In addition, Sugianto et al. (2023) also stated that the pandemic of COVID-19 hugely impacted 
transportation sectors, resulting in demand reduction and unused capacity. Furthermore, Gourinchas et al. (2020) also 
observed that the SME bankruptcy rate is much higher during the COVID-19 pandemic rather than in non-pandemic 
in 17 primarily European countries. A similar situation also occurred in Indonesia during the early entrance of COVID-
19. The Indonesian land transportation and logistics sector reported a significant decline in revenue at 25 to 50 percent
and 75 to 100 percent, respectively (Parama, 2020). Unlike the financial crisis in 1998, when SMEs remained strong
and supported the Indonesian national economy, SME sectors are the most badly hit by the Pandemic of COVID-19
due to their lack of resources for survival (Fitriasari, 2020). According to (Sasono, 2003), Indonesian cargo and freight 
predominantly consist of small companies with simple operations. The fact that trucking is a part of the Indonesian
supply chain and holds a 90.6 percent market share (Azka, 2020) made this land transportation sector a crucial
contributor to the nationwide supply-chain performance. The fall in this sector might contribute to the overall
performance of the Indonesian supply chain; thus, more research in this area of study is critical and requires urgent
attention.
This study aims to search the differences between the least and the top performer in the trucking industry, which can 
be the foundation for the supply chain manager to determine the tactical strategy to enhance company performance. 
The problem is that many companies do not know what factors they are lacking compared to the top performer; thus,

However, top-performing companies can address a broader range of resilience factors such as resilient leadership, 
innovation digitalization technology, company adaptability and flexibility, risk, and business continuity management 
(Figure 3). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. The least performer trucking companies 
 
Those factors directly improve company resilience and indirectly enhance the performance of top trucking companies. 
This finding is consistent with (Fabeil et al., 2020), which confirms that liquidity is a crucial issue faced by micro and 
small companies during the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. The result also matched Sugianto et al. (2023) 
observation, which revealed that the least performers group predominantly consists of micro-small trucking companies 
with limited financial resources, while the top performer group mainly consists of big trucking companies with more 
access to financial resources. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Top performer trucking companies 
 
The fact that top performers have better access financially than the least performed group might be why top perform 
trucking companies can manage a wide-ranging resilience factor rather than the least perform trucking companies. 
With limited access to financial resources and the fact that the least perform trucking companies primarily consist of 
micro-small trucking companies, thus it is certainly challenging to be adaptive and flexible during crises which is 
probably the reason why company adaptability and flexibility is not significant for the least perform group, yet 
contributes significantly for the top performer. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Work Recommendation 
This research highlight the similarities and differences between the least and the top-performing trucking companies. 
The least-performing group mainly emphasizes financial resource management and customer relationship 
management to enhance company resilience while focusing on innovative digitalization technology to improve their 
performance. In contrast, the top performers are different from the least performer trucking companies in a way that 
they can manage a broader range of resilience factors. In addition, they emphasize company adaptability and 
flexibility, followed by innovative digitalization technology, resilient leadership, risk, and business continuity

management to enhance company resilience, which then contributes to increased company performance. This result 
matches Pujawan and Bah (2022), who observe flexibility as one of the preferable risk mitigation strategies used to 
tackle challenges presentable during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research is unique as none of the previous research 
specifically address comparative analysis between the least and the top performer in the Indonesian trucking business. 
Knowing the differences between these two groups also helps identify which resilience factors the least-performed 
companies lack compared to the top-performed trucking companies. Hence, it can provide insight to the supply chain 
managers on which factors of resilience they need to emphasize, thus tailoring their strategy accordingly and helping 
the least performer improve their performance. Rebmann (2013) stated that no research compared various business 
sectors and mainly focused on specific types of business. This research has not covered a comparative analysis of 
different types of land transportation, which opens up these topics as a possibility for future work research.

Abstract 
Indonesia is a large country that has a large water surface and land area. Various areas are almost found on the surface 
of the area. The natural potential has not been touched as a whole in the transportation sector. Water transportation 
management is still limited to certain areas. In detail, Indonesia's land area is 1,919,440 km². While the ocean area is 
about 3,273,810 km².The potential for water transportation can still be developed widely, including tourism potential. 
The use of floating homes as a means of transportation will develop well if there is innovation and management of 
water transportation in the territory of Indonesia. Variations Structures and designs that adapt to the natural conditions 
of certain areas will further enhance other potentials and must be carried out from now on. In addition, it is also 
necessary to increase reliable human resources for the development of floating ship transportation and the availability 
of good port infrastructure adjustments

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a archipelago country that has more than 70% of its terotary is covered with water. Yet, as a developing 
country, the majority activities are still land oriented. The data shows that less than 2% of Indonesian who work in 
maritime sector (Lipi 2022) For more than 100 years of period, Indonesia has been developed based on argiculture 
and other sectrors that exploit land based areas.

5. Conclussion
The conclusion obtained is that the use of floating houses can be carried out in Indonesian waters. This is because 
there are already several water areas in Indonesia that have done and live in floating houses. The world's natural 
conditions are changing day by day, causing high water levels in land areas. The need for the construction of floating 
houses must begin to be carried out to prevent disasters if one day the surface of the land is submerged in water. The 
use of technology and the right structure is the main thing that must be considered in designing a floating building. 
Floating house planning is the use of components in the form of floating buildings to be symmetrical and using 
construction with light weight, floating shapes and plate materials that do not damage the environment, mooring 
systems must pay attention to changes in water on the site, and inter-circulation buildings to make it easier for users.

Abstract 
Companies face increasing competition due to factors such as globalization and rapid technological advancement. In 
order to remain competitive, organizations must adapt advanced manufacturing practices, improve operational 
efficiency and reduce process waste in the business process. Extracting key features and learning from business data 
are important parts of business process improvement. An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system can assist 
management through the integration and automation of core business processes to improve the performance. However, 
current ERP systems are mostly unsuitable for small and medium enterprises (SME) industries as these are very 
expensive, demand lot of resources and require modifications to the business processes to fit the ERP modules. 
Therefore, SMEs face distinct challenges which can be addressed by developing simple ERP systems. This study 
reports the design and implementation of an ERP system for ABC1, a medium size a food processing company located 
in Queensland, Australia. The aim of this research is to develop a simple and easily usable ERP system to assist in the 
operations of ABC to improve operational efficiency, increase product quality and consequently customer satisfaction, 
as well as supporting decision making. Microsoft (MS) Access was used to develop the ERP programme, following a 
modular approach to facilitate planning and management activities of ABC via the integration of key functional units. 
The key functional units within the designated ERP framework include Sales, Procurement, Production, Quality 
Management and Finance. The key realized advantages of the developed ABC ERP system include: Ergonomic and 
intuitive ERPs, Enable integration between functional units, Ability to visualize data and generate reports, and 
Scalability and expansion via additional modules and records. This study demonstrates that simple, effective and user-
friendly ERP systems are required to address the problems of SMEs.

1. Introduction
Modern business practices demand increasingly precise controls over the management of supply chains and the 
economics of critical business functions (Karim et al., 2010). To this end, a system which integrates all facets of 
business activity ranging from staffing and payroll all the way to procurement and customer relations management is 
required (Sarhan Et al., 2018). Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) fills this gap by integrating & synergizing these 
business functions to allow each individual process to be optimized towards a specific end goal while ensuring 
standards for production, procurement and pricing are maintained (Arif-Uz-Zaman, 2017). Initially, ERP systems were 
based on physical documentation and filing processes, however, today all systems are software based and this report 
development of an effective ERP system for a small or medium enterprise (SME) utilising a basic functional 
framework.   
ABC is a Brisbane based food processor which produces various juices, cordials, as well as canned fruit and 
vegetables. The company was founded in 1946 and continues to innovate and expand into new lines and productions. 
This expansion is what drives the requirement for a functional ERP system which is critical for SME which typically 
1 it is a pseudonym. For reasons of confidentiality, the name of the manufacturer cannot be disclosed.

that clearly achieves the stated aims and objectives of the project by improving operational efficiencies, appropriately 
controlling product quality and enabling more rapid decision-making in response to a dynamic and increasingly 
competitive market environment. Additionally, the clear and functional layout of user inputs and programme outputs 
means the software is approachable for employees across all levels and business functions of the enterprise, lowering 
barriers to further implementation.  
Through the application of a four-stage procurement framework used in the initial development of the ERP package, 
the five core business functions of ABC’s operation were identified. This then enabled an expanded framework of 
required business processes to form the basis of the package validated in the examples above and the generation of 
queries and associated reports providing powerful insights into business operations. This has been achieved by 
leveraging the integration of core business functions and their associated lower order processes through Microsoft 
Access.   
While successful in achieving the aims and objectives outlined in the project scope, some limitations exist in terms of 
functionality where the basic framework and narrow design brief could be readily expanded with additional modules 
and larger datasets to enable further optimization of broader business functions and deeper insights into more complex 
operations at a later stage.  
Given the success of the ERP programme developed throughout this project, it is thought that this system may be 
further enhanced by including other modules or further customized. This would be achieved through the adoption of 
an expanded functionality or framework to support analogous business functions in other enterprises with relatively 
low complexity and cost, due to the simplicity of the underlying framework and efficient reporting functions. 
Examples of similar organizations that could use the developed package include meat processing, other food 
processing companies and nurseries due to their similarities which would align with ABC's and therefore would have 
similar operational issues which can be addressed through ERP.   
Future work may include production scheduling to plan time efficient switching of multiple product lines, expanded 
data entry, additional modules as mentioned previously and the deeper integration of many more granular business 
functions such as dynamic supply chain management. This being a very contemporaneous and critical aspect of 
business planning in a post-COVID environment, making the deployment of ERP more valuable than ever.

Abstract 
Quality of work life is one of the management system approaches to coordinate and connect the potential of human 
resources, where the quality of work life in the company is a management effort to meet the needs of employees 
simultaneously and continuously. Implementing the right work quality program through fair career development 
opportunities, conducting proper supervision and working relationships, providing compensation, benefits and 
rewards in accordance with the salary market and 3Ps as well as managing and guaranteeing working conditions and 
environment is very important, thus the company is expected to can retain the best employees, so that employee 
turnover is small, commitment, loyalty and optimal performance will be generated by employees.

1. Introduction
Organizations are managed and staffed by people. Without people, organizations can not exist. Indeed, the challenge, 
the opportunity, and also the frustration of creating and managing organizations frequently stem from the people-
related problems that arise within them. People-related problems, in turn, frequently stem from the mistaken belief 
that people are alike, that they can be treated identically. Nothing could be further from the truth. Like snowflakes, no 
two people are exactly alike, and everyone differs physically and psychologically from everyone else. (Cascio, 2022) 
Human capital management is about embracing an innovative approach and recognizes the value of employee inputs. 
Feedback must be encouraged to improve the workplace environment, communication, identification of shared 
interests and creation of shared values. It is essential to build a diverse workforce and zero tolerance to discrimination. 
Managers have the authority to accomplish goals through problem solving approaches. Communication flows up and 
down the organization. (Ganapathy, 2018) Human capital is not solely the people in organizations—it is what those 
people bring and contribute to organizational success. Human capital is the collective value of the capabilities, 
knowledge, skills, life experiences, and motivation of an organizational workforce. (Mathis & Jackson, 2010). 
In an organization, human resources, in this case, employees are an important factor for the organization, therefore it 
is necessary to have things that can encourage employees to work hard and show good performance. Two factors that 
need to be assessed are motivation and quality of work life. If employees have high motivation at work, it will 
encourage employees to complete the job well. Likewise, a good quality of work life in the company will stimulate

Figure 12. Working environment 
Based on Figure 12, respondents' responses still need to be improved, this is evidenced by respondents who agree 43% 
while neutral 38%. The results of interviews with several respondents obtained the opinion that the facilities and work 
comfort are quite good, but the location of the office is in an odd-even area in accordance with the DKI Regional 
Government regulations which makes employees uncomfortable so that they give a neutral opinion. Meanwhile, the 
HCM unit stated that the company always tries to provide ergonomic facilities so as to avoid the potential risk of 
injury or disease. The workspace is ergonomically designed so that it is expected to increase productivity and 
efficiency while reducing stress and fatigue. Employees who are in the work environment are provided with adequate 
facilities, the necessary work equipment, a comfortable workspace, access to 24-hour security, conducting regular 
employee health checks, conducting periodic self-rescue programs. Also, in order to maintain the health of employees, 
the company provides sports facilities on the 6th floor that employees can use according to their needs. This is also 
reinforced by the company's trade unions. 
4. Conclusion
1.
Whereas the aspect of career development opportunities must be one of the concerns for company management
so that every employee has the same opportunity in developing a career through training organized by the
company, but not a few employees have not been touched by career development patterns; the sub-aspects of
career development have not gone well, and competency development is still a priority scale based on a high
competency gap and active employee involvement. So, it can be concluded that the career development process
based on competence has not gone well, as well as the sub-aspects of promotion, rotation, and mutation
opportunities. And there is a trend that some promotions are not transparent and not objective, so that if this
happens continuously, an unfavorable atmosphere will occur which will lead to low engagement and commitment.
2.
Aspects of supervision and working relations carried out by the leadership have been going well, the sub-aspects
of supervision and teamwork still need to be improved so that the company's performance will be better, but it is
hoped that the company's leaders will continue to improve it.
3.
Whereas the aspects of compensation, benefits, and rewards in general, employees have received their rights
adequately. The sub-aspects of salary according to the market salary are concluded to be in accordance with the
salary market in the telecommunications industry in Indonesia and have been reviewed regularly by adjusting the
company's financial condition while compensation based on 3P (pay for person, position, performance) has also
been carried out although it still needs improvement.
4.
Whereas aspects of working conditions and environment, the company has tried to create a safe, comfortable, and
healthy working environment and climate by ensuring employees work in safe and protected conditions including
ergonomic facilities so that employees can work healthily, reducing stress and fatigue.

Abstract 
In this paper, we explore the relationship between a firm’s product life cycle and its operational performance. Our 
empirical findings suggest that the firm’s product life cycle has a strong association with its operating 
performance. The results show that this relationship is monotonic with operational efficiency increasing 
significantly from the introduction stage to the growth stage and is highest in the maturity stage. The findings of 
the paper are significant for the product life cycle and efficiency analysis literature.

Abstract 
Prevention of Puma Energy facilities/structures in East and West New Britain Provinces of Papua New Guinea from 
corrosion has solely been based on sacrificial anodes. According to tests and data collected, it has proofed that 
sacrificial anodes cathodic protection (CP) system do not effectively protects the structures from corrosion. This was 
one of the main problems faced by Puma Energy PNG Limited across other CP terminals in Papua New Guinea. The 
sacrificial anodes system used by the company has ineffectively protected the structure due to its weak potential 
difference which solely emits from natural anodes (elements) without any external power supply source to effectively 
drive the current through.  According to the research and study, the possible optimum replacement option is impressed 
current cathodic protection (ICCP). The impressed current cathodic protection system is one of the best methods of 
protecting and preserving steel structures from corrosion. The impressed system potential is reinforced by external 
power supply source where anodes potentials further pushes protective current supplied from rectifier units and drive 
through electrolyte which profoundly protected the structure.

1. Introduction
The Rabaul and Kimbe Puma Energy terminals of cathodic protection system like others, have been through corrosion 
has the company immediately proposed for effective protective methods of corrosion prevention. Because Kimbe and 
Rabaul are both located near coast of Papua New Guinea, dissolved chloride and high humid have caused more damage 
to the steel structures when in contact with them.  The cathodic protection theory was first introduced in 1824 by Sir 
Humphry Davy which was financed by the royal navy to investigate corrosion on ship hulls. The notion was quite 
tedious but with time and money, he has successfully convinced the society with the idea what is now known as 
cathodic protection system. He was assisted by his pupil Michael Freddy with their extensive research both on and 
offshore (Loto and Popoola, 2011).   
The idea was impressed by the royal navy and without hesitation funded the research and project which ultimately 
become a successful notion which is now being introduced and practiced throughout the world by the modern era 
(Mohamed, Cahoon and Caley, 2012). The cathodic protection system includes sacrificial anode and impressed current 
protection using the existing electrochemical potential within the cathode and the anode. Potential differences between 
the anode and the cathode is the main difference that makes cathodic protection possible for the benefit of corrosion 
prevention in which the most negative elements are usually considered to be anode while more positive element is 
considered for cathode in electromotive force series. 
Commonly used anodes in sacrificial anodes system includes Magnesium (Mg), Zinc (Zn) and Aluminum (Al) and its 
alloys for effective protection (Mohamed, 2015). More reactive elements in nature vigorously reacts with the 
environment and dissolved instead of cathode and in so doing, these elements are sacrificed to protect the cathode 
elements (steel Structures, pipelines and tanks) from corrosion. This is way it is known as sacrificial anode where the 
anodes are sacrificed and depleted in order to protect the cathode (Kioupis, 2019)

Figure 6. Representing Rabaul Sacrificial Anode CP system 
 
There is a fluctuation on both protected and unprotected pipelines. It is vividly revealed that the level of protection 
given to the structure by sacrificial anodes do not maintained consistency and thus result to possible corrosion on 
sections of the pipelines. Furthermore, it can be concluded that there is an inconsistency due to stray current and 
impedance. This may be possibly because of weak potential supplied by the installed anodes which disappeared in 
resistive electrolyte. 
Even the protected structures have been attached as denoted by the orange line which reach even way below the -200 
millivolts which is considered failure by Australian standards and specification. The reason is again the poor 
arrangement of anodes or possibly reduction in potential supply due to overpowered by the magnitude of structures 
the anodes connected to. More amount of structures connected to the same anodes would mean that the sufficient 
energy provided to transfer impressive or protective current is minimized and thus weak and lost along its way. This 
will result in anodes consumed so quickly without proper cathodic protection. 
6.  Conclusion  
According to the data and graphs, it has been noted that both Rabaul and Kimbe CP sites of PNG Puma Energy 
facilities have been drastically reduced in cathodic protection. The sacrificial anodes potential has been limited and 
did not functions adequately and thus considered weak and fail as per international CP standard regulations 
AS2832.1.2015. It has been in dare need of recommendation for possible replacement option. This replacement option 
is impressed current where in larger structures or numerous quantities of structures, the only reliable techniques use 
to protect the structure with sufficient and adequate protection and thus its powered by external power supply source 
that continues to reinforce its potential which is the main advantage.  
 
The Puma Energy throughout the country require urgent intervention to phase-lift the sacrificial anodes to impressed 
current method. The sacrificial anodes cathodic protection method used throughout all centers have found to have 
been weak and declining due to a lot of structures attached to certain anodes which overpowers their potential to drive

the impressive/protective current from anode to cathode via electrolyte. Plenty of structures connected have weaken 
the system and thus resulted to poor CP system faced in Puma Energy across PNG terminals.  
According to the Australian standards and specification regulations AS28321.1.2015, the CP protection criteria has 
not been met by the sacrificial anodes CP. The facilities were vastly undermined by corrosion and exceeds the 
protection power rendered by sacrificial anodes system. The Puma Energy facilities do not have sufficient potential 
and strength to prevent corrosion in compliance with standard manuals as indicated by various graphs in conjunction 
with the explanation. As also reported from Puma Energy contractors, the facilities need immediate facelift to more 
reliable standards which perform reliably to protect the structure for possible corrosion deterioration. The only way to 
mitigate and safe failing CP system in Puma Energy is by replacing sacrificial anodes with impressed current for the 
benefit of facilities.

Abstract 
Corrosion occurs typically when cathodic protection coating, or other preventative method failed or corroded. In 
this research, using corrosion and structural modules in COMSOL Multiphysics, the model was created using 
finite element method. The preventative approach was taken by application of Sacrificial Anode Cathodic 
Protection to pipeline surface by using magnesium anode to protect the cast carbon steel pipeline under various 
soil types and analyze the safety potential and evaluations were made.

Introduction
Because of the increasing growth of the oil and gas industry, the operational and management complexity of 
pipelines has expanded dramatically. Corrosion difficulties and catastrophic consequences on pipelines are 
frequently caused by extreme operating conditions and a hostile environment. Corrosion in underground natural 
gas and liquid petroleum pipeline takes many forms and needs specific mitigating strategies to manage and detect 
corrosion. 
Pipelines are now the most essential mode of transportation, and these will be the best tool for energy transmission 
for the next 50 years as studied for the petrochemical, oil, and gas industries. Long-distance gas pressure 
measurements are taken by high-pressure stations. Gas pipelines serve a significant and vital role; consequently, 
they must be safe. However, the use of earliest operation of pipelines rises the possibility of existence. Interior 
and exterior corrosion is the mostly the cause of these incidents, which are particularly active in degrading pipes 
carrying gas, reducing wellbeing. As a result, regulating deterioration in gas pipelines requires the employment 
of cathodic protection. The deterioration rate is reduced by this system which has cathodic potential and turns into 
cathode. Pigging, also known as examinations of pipeline, are required on a regular basis. The movement of 
product to accomplish detailed obligations within the pipeline is called a pig. First, as one of the most serious 
hazards to gas pipelines, corrosion and its various forms will be addressed in this study (Karami 2012).  There are 
various ways justifying corrosion, with the most important is the cathodic protection. Lastly, pigs will be 
researched for the reason that pipeline functioning requires nonstop reviews for security reasons.  
Most pipeline undergoes different types of corrosion. In order to reduce these corrosion related problems, the 
principle of cathodic protection was used to lower the corrosion potential, making it invulnerable and regulates 
the rate of corrosion of a metallic structure. This can be accomplished by using two types of cathodic protection 
either Sacrificial Anode Cathodic Protection/Galvanic Anode Cathodic Protection. This project uses Sacrificial 
Anode Cathodic Protection System. 
It works by placing an anodes of magnesium alloy in a clay soil electrolyte to create circuit. The deterioration is 
controlled by the movement of current from anode into the electrolyte and release onto the steel pipeline to be 
protected. The cathodic protection is modelled in COMSOL Multiphysics software.  
Multiple anodes are buried along horizontal pipeline to reduce surface area, decrease electrical resistance to the 
ground and extend the life of anode. 
The impressed current cathodic protection uses the power from external source with inactive anodes whereas, 
sacrificial anodes cathodic protection uses the naturally occurring electrochemical potential difference between

Figure 9. Pipe cathodic protection potential under various soil electrolyte resistivities: a) 100ῼ-m, b) 90ῼ-m, c) 
80ῼ-m, d) 70ῼ-m 
From the Sacrificial Anode Cathodic Protection model, it shows that one anode cannot polarized the pipeline in 
order to protect it catholically at constant soil resistivity. Therefore, increasing the number of anodes shows that 
the pipeline is well protected. Also increasing the distance of the anode away from the pipeline shows that it is 
not well protected than placing them closer.  
Decreasing the resistivity while keeping the number of anodes constant shows that pipeline is well protected. 
Therefore, the pipeline of 20 m can be well protected when using the magnesium alloy anode with 0.2 m radius 
and 1m length, and placed at a distance of 1.5 m away from the pipeline under the electrolyte resistivity of less 
than 70ῼ-m. Therefore, SACP can be best used any soil less than 70 ohm.m soil which is a good electrolyte 
conductivity. See Table 3 of best soil types where this preventative method can be best used. 
5. Conclusion
Finally, this research offered a corrosion prevention method for the external part of underground natural gas 
pipeline. The SACP model were implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics utilizing the Secondary Current 
Distribution interfaces. In order to prevent these corrosions to occur on the pipeline surfaces, the Sacrificial Anode 
Cathodic Protection method (SACP) is applied using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. From the results it can 
be seen that the clay loam soil has a good electrolyte conductivity than sandy soil which has high resistivity. 
Therefore, SACP of underground natural gas pipelines can be best use in clay loam soil which has high electrolyte 
conductivity than sandy soil. This method is the simplest and low associated cost method to protect underground 
natural gas pipelines from corrosion.

Abstract 
The bridges along highlands highway of Papua New Guinea were Erap Bridge is also found have been constructed 
from two distinct types known as steel gaiter concrete bridge and bailey bridge. These types of bridges commonly 
found throughout the country with piers on a long span or no piers on narrow channels, which may construct 
using different methods, but the procedure in which abutments establishment is slightly common where some 
features remain similar. Before the construction of the bridge abutment, soil manipulation within the maximum 
of 5 meters depending on the strength properties of soil structure is normally prioritized. Geotechnical analysis 
of the initial phase for progressive works is paramount as the entire structure depends on effective static 
performance during its service life. The selective and approved materials to be used is important for backfilling; 
however, it also reveals the use of right Geotechnical material is necessary for consistency of abutments for its 
durability and achieves maximum design period.

Abutment: Bearing Capacity: Failure: Geotechnical: Structure.  
1. Introduction
There are many defects associated with the failure of bridges, as observed by various sources or experts. The flaws 
or defects include scouring, lateral load pressure, earthquake, temperature, soil foundations, and off-course floods, 
and other natural causes, all of which contribute to the abutment failure. This dissertation article will emphasize 
the improvement of abutments and materials required to improve the construction of the substructure and, 
importantly, soil stability by maximizing its bearing capacity in Erap Bridge. 
The loads and moments from abutments and the bridge are transferred and distributed across the span. When the 
foundation is weak due to the dissipation of water through pores beneath, it is most likely that settlement of 
abutments propagates when the weight of structure presses the pore holes, thereby displacing pore gaps and such 
may be continuous. In overtime, consequences are catastrophic. Research by (Authority, 2019) concluded that 
dead loads, superimposed loads, including moments transferred down to footings where the vibrations due to 
lateral forces and natural movements impacting the structure are absorbed. It is necessary to ensure applied footing 
pressure does not exceed allowable bearing capacity of soil beneath in which the footings established. The bearing 
capacity failure occurred when the shear strength of the earth exceeded. Thus, consequences are immediate 
excessive movement on overlying bridge and approach. 
It is also useful to consider natural impacts on the abutment basements or superstructure, such as a change in 
temperature, floods, earthquakes, and landslides. The investigation will then conclude with the best method of 
improving the foundation structure of the proposed bridge. Furthermore, the study will elaborate on with 
recommendations as to how the foundations can treat with advanced engineering materials for the best of its 
design in years to come. Further still, the investigation of improvements on bridge abutments' geotechnical failures 
with the agreed cost-wise and within budget and time to yield the best possible outcome. The construction of a 
dam or bridge foundation before abutment construction is one of the most critical stages of bridge active’s stability 
and its ultimate rigidity. The dam plays a significant role in upholding the superstructure without failing its design 
life as long as the initial construction is given the best attention right from the beginning until preparation for
