Abstract 
This research aims to analyze footwear manufacturing assembly lines' performance and increase its production by 
maximizing the measurement of performances like throughput and resource utilization with a case study. A shoe 
model with 46 components has been selected from the case company. The study starts with VSM to visualize the 
process flow, identify the production status, and any potential alerts. A discrete event simulation model is used to 
analyze precisely the manufacturing system's actual performance without disturbing the real system. After analyzing 
the collected data using the Arena input analyzer, a simulation model was developed, verified, validated, and run for 
40 replications. Six proposed alternative solutions have experimented with Arena simulation software, and the best 
alternative solution results in improvement of output from 191 to 278 and from 174 to 536, line balance efficiency 
from 68.3% to 90.1%, and from 17.6% to 76% in stitching and lasting assembly lines, respectively.

Abstract 
In recent years, with the advent of the intelligence era, all kinds of technologies have been introduced, and many of 
them are artificial intelligence-based technologies combined with extensive data analysis and decision-making. 
Traditional automobiles have also reached a milestone in transforming into driverless cars. To understand consumers' 
intentions to adopt driverless cars, this study collected data from potential users with driving experience through 
physical and online questionnaires, with a valid sample size of 457. The four dimensions derived from the technology 
acceptance model (TAM), including “perceived usefulness,” “perceived ease of use,” “attitude toward driverless cars,” 
and “acceptance intention of driverless cars,” were combined with trust to examine their casual effects toward 
driverless cars. The results show that consumers' evaluation of driverless cars depends on whether or not the functional 
features of the vehicle can satisfy their practical needs, which means that consumers' attitude toward the vehicle's 
practicality can influence their acceptance or even their intentions to adopt the driverless cars. In addition, trust in the 
product is a significant factor affecting consumers' decision to choose a driverless car. Therefore, automobile 
manufacturers still need to design vehicle functions from the consumers' standpoints to meet their needs and achieve 
achievement.

1. Introduction
With the advent of the age of intelligence, the research and development of driverless vehicles, or self-driving cars, 
has seen a significant investment from both the traditional automobile industry and technology-based companies. 
Driver assistance in the form of driverless vehicle systems, fully autonomous vehicles, and alternative transportation 
services such as Uber are in the news today. A range of technology companies, automotive suppliers, startups, and 
academic organizations are leading the technical efforts to develop the systems necessary to make transportation more 
responsive and ultimately innovative, safer products and ease of operation for all consumers.

Abstract 
Fire alarm systems play a central role in fire protection in modern buildings. High demands are placed on reliability 
so that these systems can fulfill their protection goals. In addition to the building products used, a key quality factor 
in guaranteeing this is the planning and installation of the systems themselves. Independent testing service providers 
offer third-party inspections during planning and construction. These construction quality control measures are 
intended to detect defects at an early stage and thus improve the quality of newly constructed systems. This paper 
examines the influence of quality control measures on the subsequent occurrence of defects in the operation of fire 
alarm systems. For this purpose, a comparison is made between the frequency of occurrence of defects in systems for 
which corresponding quality assurance measures were carried out during the planning and installation phases and the 
general frequency of occurrence of defects in corresponding systems. Distinctions are drawn between the defect 
categories in which system assembly defects occur. In addition, the criticality of the individual defects is classified as 
a violation of the protection objective of the systems. This serves to classify the defects presented and is carried out 
using a fault tree analysis. From the results, it can be concluded that construction quality control can significantly 
contribute to the operational quality of fire alarm systems. These results can serve as a basis for the investigation of 
risk-based maintenance approaches.

1. Introduction
In complex or public buildings, fire alarm systems are crucial to guaranteeing the protection of both people and animals 
(Akmaljon & Khoshimjon, 2023; Merschbacher, 2018). These systems meet the requirements of the building code by 
identifying fires during their formation phase; localizing the dangerous event; notifying emergency services (such as 
the fire department, police, or rescue service); isolating the area of potential danger; and managing other fire 
protection-related components of the building’s technical apparatus.

The work shown here has narrowed the existing research gap with regard to the influence of corresponding 
investigations on the operational quality of systems. The results show that the inspections carried out by independent 
experts during the first phases of the system’s life cycle actually result in significantly fewer defects being identified 
in the riskiest defect categories than in a comparison group, even during recurring inspections. 
 
It can therefore be concluded that defects in these phases can be significantly reduced through third-party inspections 
during planning and construction. Costly rectification of omissions in these phases can therefore be avoided. However, 
such inspections do not protect against defects that occur during operation due to improper maintenance and 
conversion measures. 
 
Future investigations will be based on a further deepening of the findings to create a guideline for a standardized 
method and content of early-stage inspections.

Abstract 
This paper presents the status of Integrated Management System (IMS) implementation in a heavy equipments 
manufacturing industry in India. The purpose of this research is to get an idea of how the management and employees 
felt about the IMS implementation and whether they feel the benefits after implementing it using a survey 
questionnaire. It is found that ISO 9001 (Quality management systems) and ISO 14001 (Environmental management 
Systems) are mostly adopted by adopted by the plants of this company with 22.67% each. The Lean Manufacturing 
(LM) techniques; that were incorporated in the plants are TQM with 18% and followed by Kaizen technique with 
16%. It is found that, 45% of the respondents selected ""Highly Agreed"" option that implementing IMS is helping 
towards sustainable development. The parameters: “Increased productivity” and “better risk analysis & management” 
are considered as the most influencing reasons to implement IMS in the plants with a mean value of 4.40. Correlation 
analysis; under the “barriers in implementing IMS” shows that “Lack of awareness” and “Lack of information & 
insufficient training” have strong correlation between them with a value of coefficient correlation (r) of 0.859.

1. Introduction
The main aim of Quality Management (QM) is to improve the outcome (product or service). In other words, the 
superior quality of the product may be achieved by using QMS. It helps in reducing cycle time and costs. QM ensures 
increased revenues and productivity of the organisation. It also helps in reducing waste and manage the inventory 
efficiently. Organizations typically adopt management systems (MSs) individually. Initially, the Quality Management 
System (QMS) was the main system implemented within these organizations. Subsequently, other systems were 
introduced over the following years. However, there was significant overlap in clauses among these systems, leading 
to conflicts and added complexities, as each MS was governed by different teams. Consequently, the intended 
simplification of management and cohesion as a unified group was compromised. To address this, multiple 
management systems are now combined in a manner that operates as a cohesive unit while accommodating the 
requirements of each individual MS. One prevalent integrated management system (IMS) consists of a fusion of 
International organization for standardization (ISO 9001), QMS, ISO 14001 (used for Environmental Management 
Systems-EMS) and ISO 45001(used for Occupational Health & Safety Management System-OHSMS). There are 
numerous rationales or incentives behind the adoption of Integrated Management Systems (IMS) within an 
organization; like cost reduction, enhancement of company reputation, fostering synergies among various MSs, 
minimizing paperwork, sustaining development and enhancing system efficiency etc.

questionnaire survey was designed and administered to gather the data on Integrated Management System (IMS) 
implementation in the 10 plants of this public sector company. The Questionnaire was a mix of multiple-choice, five-
point Likert scale and open-ended questions. The reliability and validity were checked with the help of MINITAB 
version 17. Additionally, correlation matrices were generated to examine potential relationships between the 
parameters. 
 
5. Conclusions 
From the collected data on the implementation of the Integrated Management System (IMS) in the 10 plants of the 
company. The questionnaire comprised a combination of multiple-choice questions, five-point Likert scale items, and 
open-ended inquiries. The parameters “Increased productivity and better risk analysis & management "" are considered 
as the most influencing reasons to implement IMS in the plants with a mean of 4.4. The parameter "" Lack of 
management & administration support "" was considered as one of the most prominent barriers in implementing IMS 
in the plant having a mean of 4.15 and SD of 1.039. Correlation matrix for the “Benefits of implementing IMS” shows 
that there is a very good correlation between the parameters: “Continuous Improvement” and “Customer Satisfaction” 
with a coefficient correlation (r) of 0.713. Similarly, parameters: “The goal to minimise water consumption” and “The 
goal to reduce energy consumption” for the ‘Environmental aspect of sustainable development’ have a strong relation 
between them having a value of ‘r’ as 0.906. 
Conflict of Interest

Abstract
 
Banking based on artificial intelligence (AI Banking) is a new phenomenon that stresses the integration of advanced 
AI technologies and techniques in the banking industry. The applications of AI in this industry encompass a wide 
array of solutions and innovations that are meant to upgrade different aspects of banking operations, customer 
experience, and financial services. Given the significance of incorporating AI in the banking system, the present 
study scrutinizes the features of AI banking and explores different challenges facing its implementation. 
Accordingly, the challenges and their evaluation criteria are ranked using the best-worst method (BWM), and the 
efficiency of the proposed solutions to address these challenges is assessed using the data envelopment analysis 
(DEA) method. Following this, a bi-objective mathematical model is proposed with the aim of minimizing the cost 
of implementing the solutions and maximizing their effectiveness, leading to the selection of the most suitable 
solution for address each challenge. Subsequently, the proposed model is solved using the augmented 𝜀𝜀− constraint 
method, and the pareto solutions derived from it are ranked using the DEA to identify the most efficient ones. 
Consequently, the most effective solutions for overcoming the challenges are identified and recommended. The 
findings indicated that the primary challenge in AI banking, namely the reducing the quality and availability of data, 
can be effectively addressed through the developing and implementing data governance policies.

5. Conclusion  
Smart banking has fostered a competitive environment in the banking system. It is an advanced and innovative 
approach that deploys new technologies, especially artificial intelligence and machine learning, to optimize and 
transform various aspects of the banking industry. Therefore, many banks are interested in incorporating AI in their 
system. It should be noted, however, that achieving this goal necessitates recognizing and resolving the challenges 
ahead. 
 
In the current study, an effort was made to identify the AI banking challenges, their evaluation criteria, and the 
available solutions to address them. To achieve this goal, library resources were reviewed and discussions were held 
with several banking experts to pinpoint the challenges, solutions, and effective criteria. Subsequently, an endeavor 
was undertaken to rank the AI banking challenges and evaluation criteria through the utilization of BWM. 
Additionally, DEA was employed to assess the efficacy of each solution in tackling the identified AI banking 
challenges. 
 
Furthermore, a bi-objective mathematical model was proposed for a more comprehensive analysis to select the most 
suitable solution for each challenge. This model had the capability to determine the optimal solution for any 
challenge by minimizing implementation costs and maximizing efficiency. Upon solving the model using the 
augmented 𝜀𝜀− constraint method and generating 10 Pareto solutions, the most effective one was chosen utilizing 
the DEA. Consequently, the Pareto solution 7 was identified as the most efficient option, and the most appropriate 
solution for each AI banking challenge was determined based on the outcomes of this solution. 
 
In order to better and more thoroughly approach AI banking, it is suggested to conduct further research using other 
assumptions and tools. For instance, it would be interesting to consider practical implications of these calculations 
and the non-deterministic nature of data. Also, one could use fuzzy DEA as a solution method. On the other hand, 
by understanding the existing challenges, one may apply an optimization model to select the appropriate solutions 
for each challenge while considering the budget constraints of each solution. Finally, simulation methods could be 
used in identifying challenges and solutions in order to approximate real-world conditions.

Abstract 
In the race to modernize, companies can often neglect foundational principles. With industry 4.0 taking 
over in manufacturing more and more SME’s are automating their processes utilising industry 4.0 
technologies. Companies are integrating more automation, data systems and new technologies in a bid to 
secure their future, become more efficient, productive and reduce costs. This race to change can mean that 
the basics that have been around for years can be missed. For manufacturing SME’s these are techniques 
and methodologies around lean manufacturing and six sigma practices that can often be as effective in 
achieving the optimisation goals they set out. The ultimate failure with this approach is that the business 
ends up automating waste in the race to keep up.

1. Introduction
For many years manufacturing has embraced lean principles and six sigma methodologies as tools for the elimination 
of waste to help optimise performance and efficiency of operations. From Henry Ford in the early 1900’s to the ground-
breaking publication of ‘Toyota Production System’ by Taiichi Ono in 1988 (Ono, 1988) manufacturers have looked 
to get leaner and reduce waste. The publications in the 1980’s really started to pave the way for many western 
companies large and small to adopt the methodologies outlined.  
The conception of six sigma also appeared in the 1980’s with the internal Motorola document titled ‘The Nature of 
Six Sigma Quality’ by Bill Smith and the development of this methodology is nicely explained in ‘Quality into the 
21st century’ (Watson, et al., 2003).  
Throughout the 1980’s and into the 21st century the ideas around lean manufacturing and six sigma have been 
developed further and further and adopted by more and more by businesses looking to stay competitive and gain an 
edge on competition. With the introduction of the concepts around industry 4.0 in 2011 (Xu, et al., 2021) 
manufacturers and engineers have been combining the digitisation of manufacturing with the principals to further 
eliminate waste and optimise processes.  
The combination of these ideas is great for many manufacturers if applied correctly. This paper aims to discuss the 
method in which these can be applied in small-scale manufacturers and how they should be implemented together as 
there is currently a risk of technology overtaking the older principals which can result in the costly automation of 
waste.

This type of scenario lends itself very well to industry 4.0. The implementation of some form of digitisation of the 
data flow utilising big data analytics, IoT and others can help reduce any data entry errors and flow of materials can 
be tracked using barcodes or RFID which are very cost-effective methods of improvement.  
 
On the flipside if the business is not mature enough to have any control over their processes with paper travel sheets 
and manual processes then this is equally a good place for them to start. This highlights the scenario that every solution 
needs to be tailored to the business in an achievable and scalable way dependant on their level of maturity.  
 
This is they type of scenario that lean and six sigma tools combined with continuous improvement methodologies, 
gap analysis and incremental improvements can highlight.  
 
4. Conclusion 
By investing in the education of members across the organisation starting at the beginning with business improvement 
techniques such as lean and six sigma, utilising tools to identify waste and not jumping straight in at the automation 
and digitisation stages companies can set themselves up for success.  
 
The need for in depth maturity assessments, gap analysis and good planning in terms of ROI and benefits statements 
can not be over emphasised. By doing these stages correctly utilising readily available tools and information SME’s 
can optimise processes with little to no cash investment.  
 
Only once the business is sure that the processes it is aiming to improve are as lean as they can be should they consider 
industry 4.0 technologies. At this stage it is suggested to consult someone skilled within this area such as a facilitator 
or industry 4.0 expert.  
 
Lean and six sigma tools can be easily learnt through simple training courses or self-lead learning online making them 
very accessible to SME’s at low to no cost. When looking at industry 4.0 technologies this is not so simple as there 
can be very complex solutions that need to be fully understood as the potential risks increase due to the rise in cost to 
test implement solutions based around industry 4.0 technologies.

Abstract 
Delivery management plays a critical role in managing both suppliers and customers. An organization seeking to 
address its manufacturing flexibilities through TQM needs to adopt a holistic approach to manage its delivery 
issues both at the supplier as well as at the customer end. This paper presents a case study of an Indian automobile 
organization XYZ Ltd. that won the Deming Award in 2013 and implemented tailor-made delivery management 
practices for the improvement of delivery performance. An exploratory method of research has been used for the 
preparation of this case study. The case study reflects that with the adoption of structured delivery management 
practices, the organization has registered an improvement of 32% in the service level of Light Commercial 
vehicles (LCV), 27 % improvement in the delivery of Heavy Commercial Vehicles, and 100% improvement in 
the delivery performance of small batches.

1. Introduction
In today's dynamic and competitive business environment, Total Quality Management (TQM) has emerged as a 
strategic approach to enhance organizational performance and customer satisfaction. Central to the successful 
implementation of TQM is the effective management of delivery processes, encompassing both suppliers and 
customers. The dynamic global economy is forcing organizations to compete for their survival. Many business 
excellence tools like TQM, TPM, Lean manufacturing, etc. play a vital role in the transformation of organizations. 
In this direction, the Indian industry has taken challenges very seriously and made some proud achievements in 
the field of achieving prestigious awards like the Deming and TPM excellence awards. Total Quality Management 
provides a holistic approach to achieving tangible benefits in the form of Quality, Cost, and Delivery.  
The adoption of an innovative and continuously improving approach within an organization serves as a driving 
force for the successful implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM), leading to significant 
enhancements in quality, productivity, cost efficiency, safety, and delivery (Sraun & Singh, 2017). Key 
performance indicators such as cost of quality and unit production cost are profoundly influenced by the 
establishment of a robust quality management system (Bhatia & Awasthi, 2018). Within the TQM philosophy, 
New Product Development (NPD) is considered a subset of innovation, and there is an emphasis on promoting its 
digitization (Marion & Fixson, 2021). To ensure the success of new product development, organizations must 
proactively address uncertainties related to market dynamics and technological choices (Biazzo & Filippini, 
2021). An insightful case study by Silva and Moreira (2021) explores the involvement of suppliers in the new 
product development process. Organizations are urged to align their policies on technology upgradation and cost 
management with their overall vision and mission to gain a competitive edge over rivals (Kumar & Gupta, 2020, 
2021). This strategic integration is essential for navigating uncertainties and achieving success in the dynamic 
landscape of new product development.

This paper provides a comprehensive exploration of the symbiotic relationship between TQM and Delivery 
Management, exemplified through the real-world case study of XYZ Ltd. The organization's success in achieving 
the Deming Award and substantial improvements in delivery performance underscores the transformative 
potential of adopting tailored delivery management practices within the TQM framework. Through empirical 
evidence, this study contributes valuable insights for organizations aspiring to attain business excellence by 
effectively managing their delivery processes in the pursuit of Total Quality Management. The paper presents

Abstract 
New Product Development (NPD) is a strategic process used by industry as a measure of business improvement 
practice to create and introduce new products or services to the market. The purpose of this paper is to explore 
how cross-functional collaboration inspires involvement of internal /external partners that subsequently 
promotes new product development (NPD) process accomplishment efficiently and effectively. The case study 
industry typically followed a structured process that includes idea generation, concept development and testing, 
product design and development, and commercialization. The exploratory study reveals that cross-functional 
collaboration directly promotes NPD success and the study provided a conceptual framework to extend our 
practical understanding of the underlying mechanisms that CFM improves NPD performance. Stabilization of 
new model production processes was attained to supply first time right products to the customers utilizing a 
metric termed as Stabilization Time Ratio. In one of the new models, the ST Ratio was achieved as 0.43 that 
governs the early stabilization of the new production process. The second target of NPD was to improve plant 
readiness to accommodate manufacturing of modified and new models of vehicles. NPD initiatives also remained 
successful in meeting this goal in most of the new models.

Abstract 
Advertisements have played a critical role in our daily lives. The divergent sections of society may need advertisement 
for various reasons, from information sharing to consumer persuasion to decision-making on purchasing. Nowadays, 
choosing Internet celebrity endorsement is one of the most popular strategies for companies or individuals to build 
successful brand development. Some theories, like Source Credibility Theory, Source Attractiveness Theory, and 
Meaning Transfer Theory, provide an explicit viewpoint of celebrity endorsement to explain how the Internet celebrity 
endorsement process influences consumers' perceptions and behavior. Therefore, this research developed and 
examined the relationships among Internet celebrity endorsement, brand perception, and customer purchase intention. 
With 250 useful survey questionnaires collected, path analysis with smartPLS was used to test the research model. 
The findings showed that celebrity’s attractiveness, expertise, and credibility significantly positively impact brand 
perception and customer online purchase intention. Besides, the most influential factor in building brand perception 
is the attractiveness of the Internet celebrity endorsement. Furthermore, consumers’ brand perception also has a 
positive direct impact on online purchase intention. Finally, discussions and implications are also proposed to conclude 
this study.

1. Introduction
Celebrity endorsement or celebrity branding is a form of advertising campaign or marketing strategy used by brands,
companies, or a non-profit organization that involves celebrities or a well-known person using their social status or 
fame to help promote a product or service or even raise awareness on environmental or social matters. Marketers use 
celebrity endorsers in hopes that the positive images of the celebrity endorser of the brand will also be passed on to 
the products or the brand image associated with the celebrities (Lee and Thorson 2008). Celebrity endorsement can 
also be considered a valuable tool in building brand perception and directly leading to customer purchase intention 
(Amos et al. 2008; Hakimi et al. 2011). In today’s wholly connected world as a worldwide cyberspace, the physical 
traditional celebrity endorsements change to Internet celebrity endorsements just through online platforms such as 
YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. In the past, all the marketing campaigns took a very long time to reach customers

Abstract 
This research deal with a case study of a plastic pallets manufacturing company in Taiwan. The main manufacturing 
process of plastic pallet is injection molding. In the company, there are several identical injection molding machines. 
Each plastic pallet only needs to be processed by one of these machines. When a machine completes one batch of 
product, additional resources are required for the changeover if different product is to be produced subsequently. 
Because the additional resources are limited, batch splitting, which would increase the number of changeovers, is not 
permitted. Moreover, at most one changeover per day. The production strategy is mainly based on make-to-stock. 
When the current inventory is less than quantity of the new order, the corresponding products will be scheduled to be 
produced in predetermined production batches which are larger than the quantity of the order. A two-phase 
methodology is proposed. In both phases, a mathematical model is developed. The model in the first phase aims to 
minimize the makespan. Then the makespan resulted by Phase 1 becomes the constraint of the model in the second 
phase. Testing data were generated for experiment. The results show the promise of the proposed methodology for 
solving practical applications.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on determining the minimum number of overtime hours needed to meet the organization’s Key 
Performance Index (KPI) at one of the Asian service companies, given the number of customer service officers 
available. The company also wants to identify the optimal number of cases each staff should handle to ensure they are 
optimally utilized and KPIs are met. Using the historical data, we identified the optimal balance of simple, moderate, 
and time-consuming cases a single staff should receive in a month. Based on the distribution, we determined the 
estimated duration needed to clear these cases. In addition, we developed a mathematical model that allows the user to 
determine the amount of sale applications the department can clear within the stipulated working hours. Additionally, 
if the forecasted demand is too much for the sale department, the model could also be used to derive the number of 
working hours the department has to work overtime to meet a percentage of their demand. Based on the extra time 
needed, the model can also derive the additional manpower required to meet the KPI. The model and the provided 
historical data confirmed that the department has been constantly overworking since the surge in demand. We validated 
our model using the actual data from the operation, and the one-month planning model developed was able to attain a 
good result with a mean absolute error of less than 5%.

Introduction
Our client is a company that provides premium service to buyers and sellers who want to sell their apartments, and the 
whole purchase process needs to be completed within an 8-week timeframe. There is also an exception when the 
process is not completed within 8 weeks, provided the buyers and seller are agreeable before signing the sale and 
purchase agreement contract.  According to the data, the company has processed 25,000 sale applications yearly for 
the past three years and an average of at least 2,000 cases monthly.  Therefore, a reliable team is required to process 
many applications every month. All the staff in the company are full-time employees, and they need unique skill sets 
and professional knowledge to serve the customers.  
There are various steps a buyer needs to take to purchase an apartment from the buyers via the online platform. The 
buyer and seller need to provide necessary documents, such as ownership of the house from the seller, the financial 
status of the buyers, and the relationship between the buyers and their share. The documents also include the intention 
and option to purchase from the seller. The sellers also need to state the mortgage tenure, interest rate, mortgage 
amount, and mode of finance. The company must also evaluate the current property price and the sale value. If the gap 
between the sale price and the current market price of the apartment is positive (Sale price – current market price > 0), 
the seller needs to pay the gap to the buyers in cash; it is called cash over valuation (COV), as most of the bank loan 
couldn’t cover the gap. However, if the property sale price is less than the market value, the buyer can take up to 80% 
of the loan based on the current sale amount. Figure 1 shows the sale application process. The 8-week time window 
only starts when all the document checks are done, and the staff in the company will open a case with a unique case 
ID.  In this paper, we are only interested in the following three steps in the sale application process: registration,

Alternatively, the mean absolute difference increases to 3.29% when we apply the same demand to the 2-month 
resource planning model. Based on the model performance, we have recommended that the company to deploy Model 
1, which is a one-month time window model for manpower planning.

Conclusion
In this paper, the authors have discussed macro-level manpower planning for the sale application process via the online 
portal in one of the service companies in Asia. The authors first performed the exploratory data analysis and created 
four additional columns, namely T1, T2, T3, and T4, to record the durations of each application to the nearest week. 
The service time at each phase is further analyzed and used as input in the mathematical model. The sale applications 
are further categorized into three difficulty levels, C1, C2, and C3, and the respective service time for T2 and T3 are 
derived.   
The authors developed two mathematical models: Model 1 is based on one month time frame and model 2 is based on 
two-months duration. The aims of the two mathematical models are similar. We wanted to identify the total number 
of cases completed given the number of CSOs and the additional hours the sales department has to work overtime to 
meet all or, if not, a certain amount of demand. The generated model tries to maximise its dependency on the data 
provided by the company. Although resource utilisation is used to reflect the productivity level of the employees, it 
can also be adjusted when other factors are considered. The utilisation rate can be adjusted after the company adjusts 
the CSO workload, such as reducing the time they need to handle emails, calls, and appeals.  
The macro-level manpower planning model was further validated using the new four-month data, and the one-month 
model has been recommended as it yields better results and is easy to implement. It that we have developed has a mean 
absolute error rate of less than 5% , which is very favorable. The model that we developed has given the management 
a way to compute the time required systematically and has been deployed to use it in their planning. It can be further 
expanded to allow for other inputs such as the cost of current workers working overtime, or cost of hiring new 
employees to meet demand. The model should ultimately serve as a guide for the sales application team as it does not 
fully encompass the real situations on the ground level. Therefore, users should only refer to the model for determining 
a rough gauge on the required number of CSO for a certain amount of demand. Expanding the model can help the sales 
application team better understand the possible range of solutions for tackling their ever-changing environment.

Ergonomic Value Stream Map Approach for Productivity 
Enhancement in Ductile Iron Pipe Industry 
Abstract 
Indian Ductile Iron (DI) Pipe Industry, being in its nascent stage, focuses to increase the production without 
thinking productivity. DI Pipe Industry, being Continuous Process Manufacturing with assembly lines operating 
throughout the year, has started adopting different methodologies like resource Optimization, Lean 
Manufacturing, and Six Sigma to increase its margins. But amid all these models, the Human Factor and 
Ergonomics (HFE) has gone somewhat overlooked as most DI Pipe plants are still labour-intensive. Most of these 
plants have very low levels of automation or almost no automation making them highly dependent on their existing 
manpower, and this push for higher productivity raises a serious question regarding the safety and well-being of 
the employees and workers. Hence, this study aims to probe into the HFE factor in the DI Pipe industry to improve 
the workers' life quality besides production and operation optimization by incorporating the HFE factor into the 
Value Stream Map (VSM) and creating a sustainable Ergo-VSM tool for the DI Pipe industry.

1. Introduction
The Ductile Iron (DI) Pipe Industry is practically very new as compared to other industries in the Iron and Steel 
sector with the Ductile Iron pipes being introduced to the marketplaces for the first time during 1950s. Ductile 
Iron Pipes are made of ductile cast iron and used for applications such as sanitary and water distribution and 
transmission purposes. This is very labour-intensive industry. So, productivity improvement is a major concern 
for top executives working in this sector. In past, many research studies have already applied to different lean 
tools for improving the productivity of DI Pipe manufacturing.  
Value stream mapping (VSM) is one of the important lean techniques which is used for improving the productivity 
of processes. This can also be applied for DI Pipe manufacturing productivity improvement by analysing the 
whole DI pipe manufacturing from procurement of raw material to finished DI pipes. Additionally, VSM also 
helps to improve the quality of the product. Previous research studies suggest that the implementation of VSM 
may cause work intensification which leads to risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) due to their works 
(Jarebrant et al., 2016). MSD is also due to work stress (Koukoulaki, 2014; Botti et al. 2017; Rathore et al., 2023). 
This is also applicable for DI pipe manufacturing.  The manufacturing of DI pipes is associated with many 
challenges and issues. The critical issues are: (i) the nature of the manufacturing process is very much physically 
demanding, and it requires manual labour for lifting and moving heavy goods and materials; (ii) It requires to 
perform repetitive task like moulding, casting, and finishing processes. These challenges lead to Musculoskeletal 
disorders (MSD) and requires ergonomic intervention to reduce these risks. 
MSD is the direct result of repetitive activities or restricted postures or working conditions that workers have to 
endure to apply the required productive improvements to the processes as per the lean manufacturing objectives 
(Botti et al., 2017). Elimination of unnecessary activities and movements or MUDA to increase productivity 
aggravates the ergonomic risks and deteriorates the well-being of the workers (André, Heldal and Edwards, 2015; 
Dombrowski et al., 2018; Koukoulaki, 2014). 
This study tried to analyse the DI Pipe manufacturing plant with Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) approach 
by incorporating ergonomics concept it into a VSM technique. Basically, this study addresses the following 
research objectives: 
RO1: To identify lean and HFE indicators to analyse the DI Pipe manufacturing. 
RO2: To incorporate HFE indicators into VSM. 
RO3: Identify the critical activities of DI Pipe manufacturing based on the calculated risk.

Table 4 (a) and (b) illustrates the overall improvement in CT and OP percentages after the ergonomics intervention 
which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of Ergonomic VSM tool in a closed continuous manufacturing unit. 
This helps us to understand how the well-being of the workers improves the overall productivity of the workplace. 
 
8. Conclusion 
This study helps the managers to understand where the current methodologies and process practices are lacking 
in terms of ergonomics. Even though HFE factors are mostly overlooked in most manufacturing organizations 
and depending heavily on lean manufacturing and Production Optimization, but nonetheless HFE factors are not 
replaceable or unworthy in any sense in the long run. As evident from the study results, one can clearly see that 
despite the high companionship between co-workers and with their supervisors and excellent working 
environment, workers are still suffering due to the shortfalls in the Physical, Psychosocial and Work design HFE 
factors. Every day, they have to battle to physical stress, insurmountable mental stress, work overload and 
unrealistic deadlines which is affecting their wellbeing and mental health. In short, we can say that they are not 
happy or satisfied with their overall conditions and demands of their jobs.  
 
So, it’s very necessary for the managers to take this into mind and incorporate these into creating the Ergonomic 
VSM tool. For implementation of the new Ergonomic VSM, more employees should be hired and positioned at 
each station so that the existing workers don’t have to battle with unattainable timelines, too much workload etc. 
Also, the level of automation for the plant (to minimise human intervention) has to upgraded so that the workers 
do not have to handle such heavy loads physically or have to be constricted in awkward working postures and 
positions.  
 
Though these rapid improvements are surely eye-catching and encouraging for everyone but what’s vital about 
these improvements are sustaining such improvements in the long run. As time passes, new demands and practices 
will come into being where these ergonomics factor cannot be retained as their initial state of implementation and 
can also be overlooked. Hence, it’s totally up to the managers and supervisors to retain these ergonomics 
development and take care of the workers’ well-being all the time while prioritising productivity, costs, and 
quality.

Abstract 
This study sought to find out the strategies of the successful implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM) 
principles in the South African banking sector. The study explored the employees’ perceptions of the strategies 
through administering a questionnaire survey to 250 bank managers at different levels. These employees were 
selected using simple random sampling. The banks from which these employees were selected, were picked using 
purposive sampling. The Cronbach’s validity and reliability test measured the confidence in relation to the 
validity, relevancy and reliability of Critical Aspects for internal consistency. SPSS-Output result for Cronbach’s 
Alpha reliability coefficient for the set of Critical Aspects Alpha value of 0.802. The SPSS-Output of Kaiser-
Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy and Bartlett’s test of Sphericity statistics is indicated in 
Table below. Furthermore, KMO values ranging between 0 and 1 show that the sum of partial correlations was 
relative to the sum of correlations. It is recommended that top management commitment should be secured first 
for the successful implementation of TQM in banks.

1.Introduction and background
Fierce competition has been thickening in the banking sector as a result of globalisation and liberalisation. This 
increased competition has afforded customers a wide range of choices of banking products and services. On their 
selection, customers select banks that can provide services that are reliable, profitable and of excellent quality 
(Maheswari and Padmaja, 2018). This demand on banks towards total service delivery has forced them to rethink 
in search for stronger and effective ways to offer better service quality and products, reduced costs, innovative 
processes and products. The banking service quality has become a sole factor for survival in the globally 
competitive market and therefore the banking sector has to take a step further in order to provide products which 
exceed the customers’ expectations. Faced with these challenges for clients, banks have to adopt the philosophy 
of Total Quality Management (TQM), a concept that is well  known to be applicable to manufacturing 
environments (Selvaraj, 2009).When TQM was adopted in manufacturing industries, the obvious benefits and 
effects on organisational performance were clearly noticeable. This encouraged organisations from other sectors 
to follow the lead.  
There have been several debates and studies conducted to determine which determinants would result in the 
successful implementation of TQM principles. It  has been agreed by many researchers that the provision of 
service quality was both a measure of competitiveness and key customer satisfaction factor in banks (Cook and 
Verma, 2002; Saravanan and Rao, 2016). This is why perceived service quality is very important to service 
providers like banks. Failure to provide high service quality is a disastrous recipe for banking sector failure. This 
was supported by many researchers who claimed that bank performance was positively and significantly linked 
to the bank’s service quality, and the most recommended approach to achieving desired service quality 
performance was through the implementation of TQM (Edoun et al, 2007; Talib, 2010).

5. Conclusion 
The results indicate that there is a need for top management commitment as one of the important steps in TQM 
implementation efforts. It should be noted that if there is lack of commitment within the top brass of the 
organisation, chances are high that implementation of TQM will fail. It is therefore clear that management should 
lead by example and show their commitment in execution of their duties and should ‘walk the talk” as this will 
influence employees’ commitment towards implementation of TQM. The perception of management on quality 
will have an effect on improving employees’ quality awareness and that will difficult to implement TQM if

management lacks commitment and quality. This should be the primary goal of the top management and that 
management should show their commitment during implementation which in turn influence their subordinates. 
There is need to align management leadership and thinking so that they will be more positive to the total quality 
management philosophy, hence objectives will be achieved. It is of great importance to choose leaders who have 
necessary qualifications and that the same efficient, leaders should allow employees to participate in the business 
operations. Leaders who therefore motivate employees and appreciate their efforts where necessary as well as 
training employees so that they will have necessary skills and expertise. This will improve the relationship 
between top management and their subordinate as well as leading to flexible relationship among various 
departments. Employees’ satisfaction and loyalty will be enhanced through good relationship with top 
management. 
As “new technologies” are developed, the banking environment in South Africa need to adopt modern technology 
to enable them to remain competitive in the global market, hence need for continuous improvement. Problems 
will be discovered during the course of the day and the organization need to critically analyse root causes as well 
as eliminating barriers hindering quality and customer service excellence Therefore, improves the way the 
organization conduct its operations. The study revealed that banking organisations in South Africa need to manage 
people / employees and operations more efficiently and effectively if total quality objectives are to be achieved.  
Furthermore, it is crucial that banks should determine and develop business processes based on specific needs. 
Once these processes have been developed, employees should absorb their roles and responsibilities and 
performance indicators should be in place so that performance measurement can be conducted which in turn 
enhance continuous improvement. In the long run, this will reduce the rate of errors and deviation in operations, 
speed up how operation activities are done as well as improving efficiency of current operations being done by 
the bank.

Abstract 
Achieving success in manufacturing over the long term requires dedicated production planning and the development 
of outstanding products. This study presents an optimization model incorporating Six Sigma concepts to tackle the 
industrial sector's complex production planning problems. The objective is to develop a comprehensive framework 
that optimizes production planning while maintaining high-quality standards. The research utilizes Six Sigma 
approaches to provide a systematic framework for decision-making, ensuring a comprehensive approach to quality 
engineering in manufacturing processes.

1. Introduction
Companies must continuously strive for operational excellence to stay competitive in today's rapidly evolving market. 
One approach gaining significant traction in the manufacturing sector is the implementation of Six Sigma principles 
to improve product quality. Six Sigma methodology minimizes defects and process variations to ensure consistent, 
high-quality output.  Six Sigma, a well-designed program, is widely used across several industries to achieve targeted 
performance levels via continuous improvement (Douglas & Erwin, 2000). It is a statistical metric representing six 
standard deviations from the mean, with the term 'Sigma' derived from the Greek alphabet to symbolize statistical 
variance. The Six Sigma methodology provides a comprehensive range of instruments to optimize performance and 
minimize faults in any process (Vote & Huston, 2005). It is important to note that as the degree of quality grows, the 
process undergoes improvement, reinforcing the value of Six Sigma. Six Sigma is a methodology used in the field of 
industrial engineering. It is used in industrial businesses to enhance operations. Six Sigma employs various 
approaches, techniques, and tools from industrial engineering, quality management, and statistical analysis. Six 
Sigma applies in the manufacturing sector and many industries, such as administrative procedures. Six Sigma is 
primarily used to address complex issues that are not simply solvable (to put it in simpler terms). Attaining the 
predetermined objective is challenging (McAdam et al., 2014). In addition, the primary objective of the service-
oriented production planning process is to enhance the company's competitiveness by considering customers' 
viewpoints or operational plans and then prioritizing the horizontal procedure and quality.  Six Sigma is a quality 
improvement methodology known for the features mentioned by (Chen et al. 2009; Cheng et al., 2009).  
This study investigates the integration of Six Sigma into multi-objective production planning to improve the overall 
quality of products. By aligning production goals with quality improvement initiatives, companies can achieve optimal

• 
The firm's production demand objective is not entirely met due to the presence of non-zero negative deviational 
variables; thus, the company must formulate a plan to fulfill the demands.  
• 
The value of overachievement for goal two is 500, while the value of underachievement is zero. Consequently, 
the goal of minimizing production costs was achieved, and the firm will reduce its costs by SAR 500 per total of 
three units (each unit of these three products) for the following year. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Goal programming models and their applications to real-life manufacturing problems have become increasingly 
popular as a reliable decision-making tool for handling multiple conflicting objectives. Modern manufacturing has 
become increasingly complex due to customer demand uncertainty, competitive markets, and rapid technological 
developments.  
An effective production plan is pivotal in helping decision-makers achieve the organization's objectives. By 
optimizing resource utilization in a given situation, it can significantly contribute to the organization's success. This 
study presents a goal programming model that incorporates Six Sigma, a model that has proven successful in 
determining the most efficient production plan for industries. The model's optimal solution demonstrates its 
effectiveness, as it enables the industry to fully achieve all the goals identified in this study, instilling confidence in 
its potential.

Abstract 
The Digital Twinning of Manufacturing Systems is continuously gaining in importance concerning the optimization 
of production processes and requirements for production efficiency improvements. Therefore, the finite state method 
will be presented in this work as a semi-analytical approach of the Production System Engineering based on Markov 
Chains. The presented method can efficiently calculate the probability distributions associated with each possible 
system state defined according to the number of buffers and their capacities. In this study, the finite state method is 
employed to describe the ship steel hull process as a platform for the implementation of digital twinning technology. 
The method is employed to rebuild a model of a real ship production process using a combination of serial and splitting 
lines. The key performance indicators such as the production rate, the work in process, and probabilities of starvation 
and blockade are calculated and compared to the corresponding results obtained through a simulation approach using 
the software tool Enterprise Dynamics. The conclusion highlights the advantages and disadvantages of methods 
employed in the context of Digital Twin Technology.

Abstract 
Accessing the performance of library is crucial for education, research, and community development. it facilitates 
efficient resource allocation by identifying areas of strengths and weaknesses and enabling libraries to prioritize 
investments where they are most needed. Therefore, this study developed a multi-factor decision-making approach to 
accessing the performance of Indian libraries. We proposed fuzzy integrated decision-making framework to identify 
and analyze these factors in this context. First, we identify thirteen factors which impact the performance of libraries 
from extensive literature review. Then, we screened thirteen factors using Fuzzy Delphi method and identified eleven 
key factors which impacting the performance of library. Further, we computed the weights of key factors using Fuzzy 
Analytic Hierarchy Process and ranked the factors based on their weights. In order to evaluate the Indian library, we 
chose ten different Indian libraries and analyzed their performance using Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by 
Similarity to Ideal Solution. The results revealed that Library 4 is the most efficient library. Moreover, the proposed 
framework serves as a useful tool for library management to address performance related challenges. The framework 
offers library management a helpful tool to address performance-related challenges. It provides a practical solution to 
tackle obstacles and optimize operations. The clear and concise approach ensures efficient management of libraries, 
allowing them to function smoothly and effectively.

1. Introduction
India’s increasing population is a big concern for the services such as libraries, rail network, etc. and it increases the 
burden on these systems. Among these services, we cannot ignore the library services. In addition, in this current 
globalized and digital era, there is a need to update and modify the library resources and infrastructure as per the 
students’ requirement. So there is a requirement of a framework to assess the performance of libraries to identify the 
least performing libraries as well as there is a requirement to identify the relevant criteria to measure the libraries 
performance also. In addition, performance assessment of libraries in Indian context is very limited and less explored 
domain. There are several criteria for the measurement of performance. But it is very difficult and quite challenging 
to consider all the criteria simultaneously. In similar context, our study proposed a multi-criteria decision making 
framework to rank Indian libraries based on their performance by considering all the criteria simultaneously. Basically, 
we addressed the following research questions in this study: 
•
RQ1: What are the criteria to measure the performance of libraries?
•
RQ2: Among them, which are the most relevant criteria in Indian context?
•
RQ3: How these criteria can be ranked based on their importance?
•
RQ4: How Indian libraries are ranked based on these criteria?

5. Result and Discussion 
The proposed multi-criteria decision-making framework is applied to rank the Indian libraries based on the identified 
criteria. After collecting and examining the responses for the crucial factors affecting the performance of Indian 
Library, we used the computational techniques outlined in section 3.1. The factors were either selected or discarded 
based on a computed threshold value (β=0.56). Non-English-speaking background and Socio-economic index were 
eliminated as they were deemed irrelevant for this study. It's important to note that their exclusion doesn't mean they 
are inherently irrelevant, but rather that the interviewed experts prioritized other factors over them. Subsequently, 
eleven relevant factors out of thirteen are identified for measuring the library performance with the help of FDM 
method. 
 
Second, the weights of each relevant criteria are computed with the help of FAHP method. Total holdings of resources 
(books and audio Visuals) (C9) are identified as the most important criteria among the eleven criteria followed by the 
seating capacity (C5), as shown in Table 3. The library's collection of books and other materials is crucial for serving 
its patrons effectively. The size and variety of the collection directly impacts how well the library meets its goals. A 
robust collection ensures the availability of resources that cater to diverse interests, educational needs, and research 
inquiries. This, in turn, correlates with higher user satisfaction and engagement, as patrons can easily find what they 
need. By analyzing usage patterns and material popularity, librarians can identify trends, evaluate collection 
development efforts, and allocate resources strategically. Furthermore, a comprehensive collection supports academic 
research and scholarship, as well as fostering lifelong learning and information literacy among patrons. Comparing 
the total holdings to industry standards helps librarians assess the library's performance and make informed decisions 
about its collection. The ranking of each criteria is done on the basis their weights. It is important to focus on this 
criterion for improving the performance of library.  
 
In the last step, we ranked the ten Indian libraries on the basis of their performance with the help of FTOPSIS method. 
The results revealed that 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 4 is the most efficient library. Indian libraries have many constraints like library 
space, seating capacity, and database management. These constraints can decline the performance of library. The 
complete ranking of the libraries based on their performance of criteria are as follows: 
 
𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳 𝟒𝟒> 𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳 𝟐𝟐> 𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳 𝟏𝟏> 𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳 𝟕𝟕> 𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳 𝟖𝟖> 𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳 𝟏𝟏𝟏𝟏> 𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳𝑳 𝟑𝟑

6. Conclusion 
The main contributions of this study are threefold: First, this study identifies a comprehensive set of criteria for the 
development of multi-criteria decision-making framework. Second, the framework enables us to rank the relevant 
criteria on the basis of their importance for the performance measurement of Indian library. Third, we found the best 
and least performing library on the basis of closeness coefficient among the ten Indian library. Thus, the decision-

Contracts in the Mining Industry

Abstract 
In the mining industry, service contracts are essential for ensuring that outsourced operations run smoothly and 
efficiently. However, managing the scope of such contracts can be a significant challenge. Without proper scope 
management, service contracts can quickly become a financial burden and a source of conflict between mining 
companies and service providers. To address these issues, a framework to effectively manage the scope of service 
contracts is necessary. This framework should provide guidance on how to define the scope of a service contract, 
navigate changes in the scope, and ensure that both parties are satisfied with the services provided. This study 
investigated existing frameworks in the project management field and their potential application in service contracts. 
This study was conducted through a survey using quantitative analysis to examine the relationship between poor scope 
management and the occurrence of scope creep in services. The study concluded that there are similarities between 
managing the scope of projects and services; however, nuisances between projects and services would require separate 
frameworks. This study’s outcome is a framework that can be used to assist contract owners and supervisors in 
effectively managing their service contracts, thereby reducing the risk of scope creep and its associated negative 
impacts.

Scope Management Framework, Service Contracts, Scope Creep and Scope Change 
1. Introduction
Effective scope management is a critical aspect of service contract management that ensures the successful delivery 
of services that meet the expectations of both the service provider and the client (Mirza et al. 2013). In today's business 
environment, where organisations increasingly rely on outsourcing services, it is essential to have a clear 
understanding of the best practices for managing the scope to avoid project delays, cost overruns, and quality issues 
(Mirza et al. 2013). Without proactively managing service contracts to ensure that the scope of services is executed 
correctly, rendered services may not meet the requirements set out in the contract agreement, thus impacting the client 
financially (Forth and Lock 2020). To address this challenge, a framework to effectively manage the scope of service 
contracts is necessary. This framework should provide guidance on how to define the scope of a service contract, 
navigate changes in the scope, and ensure that both parties are satisfied with the services provided. This study explores 
such a framework and its potential benefits for the mining industry. 
1.1 Objectives 
Scope management is a critical aspect of project and contract management that ensures that projects and services are 
delivered within defined boundaries. While the significance of scope management in project management is well 
known, there is limited research that focuses specifically on the challenges associated with scope management in 
service contracts. This study addresses three pertinent themes related to the poor scope management of service

II. 
Share the lessons learned and best practices with relevant stakeholders to enhance their understanding and 
effectiveness in managing the scope of mining service contracts. 
III. 
Continuously review and enhance scope management processes based on feedback, performance metrics, 
and industry developments. 
8. Contractor and stakeholder management 
Throughout the process, contractor and stakeholder management is crucial to developing and maintaining the 
relationship between the contractor and mining company to ensure successful delivery of the service. Governance 
mechanisms should be defined during the contracting phase to ensure that the risk of misunderstandings or disputes 
between mining companies and contractors is limited. The most effective governance mechanism for improving 
performance is contractual governance, in which a contractor’s working relationship is primarily managed through 
formal contracts. Given that service contracts may continue for extended periods of time, relational governance should 
be adopted, where less emphasis is placed on legal mechanisms and there is a degree of trust between the contractor 
and the mining company. Both mechanisms are crucial for managing relationships with contractors and hybrid 
mechanisms can be considered for service contracts. 
 
5.4 Validation  
Scope creep is considered a major challenge in projects, and can lead to financial losses, reduced project quality, and 
disputes (Umuhoza et al.2021). Mirza et al. (2013) concluded that a major contributor to unsuccessful projects is poor 
scope definition and scope control. It was found that proper scope definition and effective scope management result 
in the successful delivery of projects that meet the agreed upon quality, cost, specified timelines, and stakeholders’ 
needs (Mirza et al. 2013).  
 
While many studies have investigated the occurrence and negative impacts of scope creep on projects, these impacts 
may be prevalent in service contracts. Forth and Lock (2020) found that failures in service contracts are common when 
contract management is not maintained. Without proactively managing service contracts to ensure that the scope of 
services is executed correctly, rendered services may not meet the requirements set out in the contract agreement, thus 
impacting the client financially (Forth and Lock 2020). To address this challenge, a framework to effectively manage 
the scope of service contracts is necessary. Frameworks provide a structured approach to managing project scope, 
which is essential for delivering projects on time, within budget, and meeting stakeholders' expectations. 
 
6. Conclusion  
A scope management framework is an invaluable tool for effectively managing the scope of service contracts and 
preventing or limiting scope creep. The nuances between project and service contracts emphasise the need for a 
dedicated framework for managing the scope of service contracts. Services are continuous, repetitive activities that 
meet operational needs, whereas projects are temporary endeavours with specific goals and deliverables. Both have a 
scope of work which defines the activities that should be executed during the contractual period. Similarities between 
services and projects allow existing scope management frameworks to be leveraged, whereas key differences require 
the frameworks to be adapted for their intended application. The main causes of scope creep and its impacts on service 
contracts were identified, and a framework was developed to manage the scope and prevent the identified scope creep 
causes.

1. Introduction
Additive manufacturing (AM) also known as 3D Printing  is becoming a disruptive technology to compete with 
traditional subtractive processes like machining. AM is used extensively in dental, medical, aerospace, fashion design, 
food processing, fashion, and prototype tooling, and in manufacturing industries The global 3D printing market size 
was estimated at USD 20.67 billion in 2023 and is projected to be worth around USD 98.31 billion by 2032 with a 
notable CAGR of 18.92% during the forecast period 2023 to 2032. Effortless in development of tailored products, 
reduction in manufacturing cost and process downtime, manufacturing of the functional parts  makes this technology 
a viable solution to the traditional machining process. The demands of quick turnaround time, faster delivery  and 
cheaper cost make AM technology very attractive. It is predicted that the AM technology may replace traditional 
manufacturing methods in the near future. AM processed part is  being fabricated layer by layer using various 
polymers. Whereas the Injection molded part was fabricated using specifically designed  molding dies. The global 
plastic injection molding market is valued at $175.02B in 2021 and expected to reach $266.1B by 2030 poised to grow 
at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% from 2021 to 2030. The global CNC milling machines market 
size was valued at USD 79 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to reach around USD 113 billion by 2033, growing at a 
CAGR of 3.64% from 2024 to 2033. The CNC milling machines market growth is driven by rise in industrialization,

Volume and Budget play a significant role in selecting the right manufacturing process. For example, 3D Printing has 
very little start-up cost due to no tooling or programming required. Printing time plays an essential role in the unit cost 
for 3D printed parts. The Injection molding process is preferred for high volume production because of the low unit 
cost. But the start-up cost may be higher due to Mold tooling. CNC machining may require a small start-up cost to 
cover CAD/CAM development. Machining time will determine the unit cost per piece. Complex geometry parts will 
take more cycle time increasing the unit cost. One must choose the “right” manufacturing process based on volume 
and budget. Lead time also may play a role in selecting the right manufacturing process. 3D printed parts may take 2-
7 business days compared to CNC machining may take 10-25 business and Injection Molded parts may take 20-30 
business days. Material and Surface finish may also play a role in selecting the right manufacturing process. The 
design complexity of the part also will play a role in selecting the right manufacturing process.

Abstract 
In 2021, an insurance company implemented a gamification strategy to enhance the adoption of simulation services. 
Gamification, as highlighted by Desai & Nagaraju (2018), aims to boost motivation, productivity, and employee 
engagement. This strategy combined design science research and game design methodology to promote awareness 
and encourage the use of simulation services for decision-making. Using a conceptual game model developed in 
Simio, employees engaged in a simulation game where they competed to achieve the highest score by controlling 
variables like resources and overtime allocation. This competitive approach effectively demonstrated the benefits of 
simulation services. The strategy resulted in a notable increase in demand for simulation services, with a 92.3% rise 
from 2020 to 2021, as indicated by archival data analysis. Additionally, the reach of the service expanded, with seven 
departments requesting simulation services in 2021 compared to five in 2020.

Gamification, Motivation, Simulation and Design Science Research. 
1. Introduction
An insurance company in South Africa established a business process improvement department in 2016 to enhance 
efficiency. Among its services, the department offers process simulation to analyse and improve workflows. Despite 
its inception in 2016, the simulation service was underutilized. To boost its adoption, a gamification strategy was 
implemented in 2021. This involved creating an interactive simulation game with elements like points, leaderboards, 
and winning states, allowing employees to compete and make decisions affecting system performance metrics. This 
approach significantly increased demand for simulation services, as evidenced by a comparison of completed 
simulation models in 2021 versus previous years. 
1.1 Objectives 
This case study aims to investigate and document the factors that contributed to the success of the implementation of 
the gamification of the simulation services within the insurance company. The case study combines the work of 
gamification theory, motivation theory, design science research and simulation modelling by answering the following 
questions:  
•
How did the gamification strategy affect the number of simulation model requests received during 2021?
•
Did the gamification strategy impact the reach of simulation within the insurance company?
2. Literature Review
The following section contains an academic scientific and management practice literature review of gamification 
theory, motivation theory, design science research, and process simulation.

5.3. Proposed Improvements 
The success of the gamification strategy in this case study is notable. However, it's essential to acknowledge the 
context leading up to its implementation. Prior to 2021, simulation services were primarily positioned as risk-
mitigating tools within the insurance company, with limited explanation of their benefits despite being included in 
training materials. This existing internal client base and inclusion in training materials could influence the results 
observed. Nonetheless, the findings suggest promising avenues for future research in gamification and its impact on 
increasing demand for process simulation services within the insurance sector. Future studies could explore the 
nuanced effects of different gamification features, such as rewards, competition, or engagement approaches, on 
various aspects of insurance operations. Additionally, investigating the long-term sustainability of increased demand 
and its implications for organizational performance would be valuable. Comparative studies across industries or 
within the insurance sector could also offer insights into the adaptability and scalability of gamification tactics, 
providing practitioners with actionable information. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The main goal of the gamification strategy was to promote the use of process simulation as a decision-making tool. 
Participants in the gaming sessions were introduced to the concept of process simulation, a powerful technique for 
analysing complex systems. The gamified simulation model, coupled with competitive elements among participants, 
effectively conveyed the concept. This friendly competition enhanced engagement and emotional connection to both 
the game and the simulation service. The strategy employed both intrinsic motivation, driven by participants' desire 
to improve solutions, and extrinsic motivation, by pitting participants against each other to achieve the best score. An 
analysis of historical data revealed an increase in departmental diversity in simulation service requests in 2021 
compared to the previous year, supporting two propositions. Firstly, the gamification strategy significantly increased 
awareness of the simulation service, evidenced by a 92.4% rise in service requests from 2020 to 2021. Secondly, it 
expanded the reach of the simulation services within the company, with requests coming from seven departments in 
2021, demonstrating the strategy's success in increasing diversity.

Abstract 
Efficiency in waste management is critical for urban sustainability, particularly in rapidly expanding cities such as 
Bisha in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This study examines the effectiveness of the implementation of a GIS-based 
waste management system through the application of project management techniques and economic analysis. The 
system aims to enhance operational efficiency, economic savings, and environmental sustainability by optimizing 
waste collection routes and waste bin placement. The processes of the GIS-based system implementation are analyzed 
using project management techniques such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and the Program Evaluation and 
Review Technique (PERT). These techniques have defined critical activities and optimized the project timeline. 
Additionally, an economic analysis evaluates the system's cost-effectiveness by computing the payback period, which 
estimates the duration required for the system to recover its initial investment through operational savings. The study 
results support the hypothesis that a GIS-based waste management system's efficiency may be increased by 
implementing project management techniques, resulting in a 9-month reduction in the overall duration of 
implementation from 63 months to 54 months. The economic study further confirms the cost-effectiveness and 
sustainability of the system over its expected 20-year lifespan, as seen by a positive payback period of less than five 
years. Contributing to broader environmental sustainability and public health goals, the paper concludes that such a 
model could be utilized as a guide for improving waste management practices in Bisha and other similar urban cities.

1.Introduction
The city of Bisha, located in the southern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is experiencing a rapid population increase, which 
has led to an escalation in solid waste generation. As the city continues to develop, aligning with global urbanization 
trends, there is an urgent need to establish sustainable waste management that can efficiently deal with the increasing 
volume of waste. To address these challenges, this paper seeks to examine the implementation of a GIS-based smart 
system, supported by project management techniques such as CPM and PERT, along with an economic analysis study. 
The aim of the system is to optimize the spatial distribution of waste bins, thereby reducing the costs associated with 
waste collection and improving overall system effectiveness and efficiency. The rapid increase in solid waste 
generation can be attributed to factors such as the continuous economic growth experienced by cities, urbanization, 
and the continuous industrialization that the world is still experiencing (Danbuzu et al., 2014).

As the system will take approximately 5 years, which is less than its lifetime, to repay itself, the investment 
is worth the cost. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, to achieve more efficient and sustainable waste management, it is essential to develop strategies that 
result in enhanced management of waste operations across the city of Bisha. The research aimed to comprehensively 
analyze the application of project management techniques alongside an economic analysis of GIS-based system 
implementation to optimize Bisha's waste management system through improved operational efficiency, economic 
savings, and environmental sustainability. 
 
The rapid population growth and urban development in Bisha necessitate a sustainable approach to waste management. 
This paper assesses the effectiveness of a GIS-based smart system using project management techniques and economic 
analysis. By leveraging GIS technology and project management methodologies like CPM and PERT, cities can better 
address the challenges posed by increasing solid waste generation. By precisely identifying the critical path and 
allocating resources to those responsive components, the application of CPM and PERT methodologies in project 
management has improved efficiency and punctuality and resulted in a 9-month timeline reduction, from 63 months 
to 54 months. The system's economic analysis indicates a payback period of less than five years, indicating its worth 
within its expected 20-year lifespan. 
 
The approaches used with the smart waste management system based on GIS analysis provide a valuable tool for city 
planners and waste management authorities. The system's benefits include improved waste collection routes, reduced 
operational costs, and enhanced overall cleanliness. Leveraging technical innovations and project management 
practices will be crucial in realizing efficient, sustainable, and profitable waste management systems not only in Bisha 
but also in other urban areas facing similar challenges.

Abstract 
The agricultural sector faces mounting pressure to increase food production sustainably in the face of climate change 
and population growth. To achieve “Zero Hunger” of  Sustainable Development Goal 2,  the integration of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) technologies into agriculture, known as Smart Agriculture, holds immense potential to enhance 
productivity, optimize resource utilization, and address the growing global food demand.  AI offers significant 
potential to revolutionize farming practices by optimizing resource use, improving crop yield, and enhancing decision-
making. However, the widespread adoption of AI in smart agriculture remains limited compared to other industries. 
Through the lens of the Technology Organisation Environment (TOE) framework, this qualitative study aims to 
identify and analyse the key factors that influence the adoption of AI in Smart Agriculture. Through in-depth 
interviews with farmers, agricultural experts, policymakers, and technology providers, the study examines the factors 
that facilitate or hinder the adoption of AI-based solutions. The results identify both encouraging and discouraging 
factors categorized into economic, socio-psychological, contextual, technological, organisational factors and

Abstract 
Mobile network operators in developing countries often rely on traditional fraud detection systems, overlooking the 
potential of advanced machine learning techniques. This study addresses this gap by developing an International Revenue 
Share Fraud (IRSF) detection model using ensemble learning with random forest and support vector machine algorithms. 
The model analyzes Call Detail Records (CDRs) to identify fraudulent call patterns. CDRs contain call attributes like 
time, duration, source and destination numbers and completion status, providing valuable data for anomaly 
detection.  Random Forest is chosen for its effectiveness in handling complex and imbalanced datasets, common in 
telecom fraud scenarios. Its ability to address imbalanced data is crucial, as fraudulent calls are typically rare compared 
to legitimate ones. This research aims to develop a machine learning model that leverages call logs to detect fraudulent 
international account takeover. Our results advance descriptive analysis and improve knowledge of the traits and patterns 
of IRSFs. In the end, this produces a picture of IRSF operations that is more accurate. The model demonstrates good 
predictive performance on the testing set with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.1208, indicating a low average absolute 
difference between predicted and actual values and the R-squared value of 0.9828 signifying strong overall predictive 
accuracy.

1. Introduction
Telecommunications has become increasingly important in modern society, with customer needs no longer being limited 
to just connectivity, but also requiring access anywhere and anytime. This puts pressure on telecommunications operators 
and also increases the risk of new forms of digital fraud. In an industry where profit margins are increasingly tight, fraud 
represents the most significant avoidable threat to revenue for mobile operators, and in some regions, IRSF is a major

not necessarily yield favorable results if extrapolated to different telecommunications providers or varied instances of 
fraud. 
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements 
The research presented in this paper has made significant progress in evaluating the efficiency of the proposed fraud 
detection model. This paves the way for its potential implementation in real-world telecommunication systems. It's 
important to ensure seamless integration and compatibility with the existing telecommunication infrastructure to enable 
a smooth transition and adoption of the model. Additionally, the model's performance should be optimized for real-time 
processing to enable timely identification of fraudulent activities, minimizing latency and maintaining efficient 
integration with call processing systems. It's also significant to manage the scalability of the model to manipulate the 
voluminous quantity of data generated by telecommunication meshes, securing that the model can reuse considerable 
scale data without risking its delicacy or trustability. 
 
5.2 Validation  
The results of the model evaluation shed light on how efficiently the Random Forest algorithm performs on the training 
and testing sets (Table 2).The training set metric in Table 2 show the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2674 indicates 
the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values. A low MAE suggests that the model is relatively 
accurate in its predictions. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 1.0568 further quantifies the overall squared difference 
between actual and predicted values. The R-squared value of 0.9999 signifies an almost perfect fit of the model to the 
training data. These metrics collectively demonstrate the high accuracy and precision achieved during the training phase. 
The testing set metrics, the MAE of 1.1208 indicates the average absolute prediction error on the unseen data. While 
slightly higher than the training set MAE, it remains relatively low, implying good predictive performance. However, 
the MSE of 2.7873 is noticeably larger, reflecting increased variability in the prediction errors. On the testing set, the R-
squared value of 0.9828 shows good predictive potential.

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the development, design and assessment of the machine learning-based fraud detection model for 
telecommunication networks have yielded promising results in identifying fraudulent activities. This demonstrates its 
potential for real-world deployment. Another important objective of the study was to detect fraudulent call activities on 
the network specifically targeting the international market. The implemented Random Forest model has exhibited 
exceptional accuracy, evident from the evaluation metrics on both the training and testing sets. The low Mean Absolute 
Error and Mean Squared Error on the training set reflect the model's ability to closely approximate actual values. 
Although there is a minor increase in errors on the testing set, the high R-squared value indicates a robust correlation 
between the predicted and actual values. These findings strongly align with the goal of creating a predictive model 
capable of effectively identifying fraudulent events on the network. 
 
The future of fraud detection will undoubtedly be transformed by AI and ML. These cutting-edge technologies will 
continuously progress, enabling increasingly effective identification and prevention of fraud. Telecommunication service 
providers are strongly advised to integrate and fully embrace these models into their systems to combat fraudulent 
activities and optimize revenue generation. These advanced models can swiftly and precisely analyze vast amounts of 
data, decisively reducing and proactively combating the occurrence of IRSF. Moreover, they can adeptly adapt to new 
forms of fraud, empowering organizations to consistently stay ahead of criminal activities.

Abstract 
This study examines the socio-psychological determinants of country of origin image, namely country of brand (COB) 
and country of manufacture (COM) images, for products from developed versus developing countries. It also 
investigates the effects of COB-COM congruence and incongruence on consumers’ purchase intention and product 
trial. Research was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand with 400 consumers of personal-care products using a survey 
questionnaire and a field experiment. The four socio-psychological constructs measured were consumer 
ethnocentrism, cosmopolitanism, materialism, and value-consciousness. We found that cosmopolitanism and 
materialism positively affected both COB and COM, but only when the origin was a developed country. Value-
consciousness, however, positively affected both COB and COM regardless of the country of origin. The effect of 
COB-COM congruence and incongruence were not found. Nevertheless, when COB and COM were congruent, 
purchase intention and product trial were significantly different between developed and developing country of origin.

Abstract 
The re-surfacing of Monkeypox (Mpox) a zoonotic viral disease that causes painful blisters on the skin of the infected, 
as a global health concern has triggered the rapid and important development of useful and effective diagnostic tools 
to bolster the existing traditional methods such as contact tracing and timely intervention. Machine learning (ML) 
algorithms have shown promising results in the early detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases, including Mpox, 
by leveraging diverse data sources such as electronic health records, clinical images, and laboratory results. This 
Systematic Literature Review aims to assess the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in detecting Monkeypox 
(Mpox). The main question is: ‘How well do machine learning algorithms perform in detecting Monkey Pox?”The 
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were employed for this 
review. An in-depth search was done spanning several databases, namely ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital 
Library, and Springer Link. Studies published between 2022 and 2024 were considered. After removing duplicates 
and screening for relevance and quality, a total of 30 papers were included in the final analysis. The outcomes indicate 
that ML algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs), have 
proven to have high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting Mpox. These algorithms perform strongly compared to 
traditional diagnostic methods like contact tracing, resulting in faster and more reliable results. The integration of ML 
with imaging techniques, such as dermoscopy and radiography, has further enhanced diagnostic precision. 
(ML)algorithms present a notable advancement in the detection of Monkeypox. They are very robust in the face of
large datasets and give a very high level of accuracy and precision in interpreting the datasets, to this effect however
further research is needed to address the challenges of data variability and the need for large, high-quality datasets.
The review's findings offer practitioners and policymakers in healthcare important new information. The creation of
novel diagnostic procedures and guidelines can be influenced by the proven efficacy of machine learning algorithms
in Mpox detection. The results also emphasize the necessity of funding machine learning research and infrastructure
to enhance disease surveillance and response tactics.

addressing the limitations of machine learning techniques and suggesting future research directions. This SLR 
acknowledges that it has certain limitations, including publication date and language restrictions. Overall, however, it 
concludes that machine learning techniques are an effective way to improve monkeypox detection.

Abstract 
Diabetes, a chronic illness causing serious health problems, affects millions of people globally. With cases expected 
to rise, effective strategies for managing, detecting, and preventing the disease are essential. Artificial intelligence 
(AI) and machine learning (ML) have become powerful allies in this fight. These advancements aid in the automated 
detection of eye complications (retinopathy), supporting clinical decisions, identifying high-risk populations, and 
empowering patients to manage their health.  The significant public health challenge of diabetes in Zimbabwe, 
impacting all demographics, highlights the need for better solutions. This research aims to develop a precise predictive 
model for diabetes using the CRISP-DM methodology. Machine learning techniques like random forest, Naive Bayes, 
XGBoost, decision trees, and support vector machines, were used to predict the presence of diabetes. The results 
revealed that the random forest approach outperformed other models, demonstrating a larger area under the curve 
(AUC).

1. Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic illness that has grown to be a significant global public health concern (Hanlon et al. 2020). 
Diabetes caused around 1.5 million deaths in 2019 and is predicted to cause 5 million deaths by 2030 (Wou et al. 
2019). This translates to a significant burden on healthcare systems, with global costs reaching billions of dollars. The 
disease is particularly concerning in low- and middle-income countries (Tripathi et al. 2022). The World Health 
Organization (WHO) warns of a diabetes crisis, with millions already affected, especially in developing countries and 
these numbers are expected to climb even higher in the coming years (Mozaffarian 2020).

to improve their safety and overall mining experience. In a quantitative study approach involving 400 artisan miners, 
a survey questionnaire was conducted to gather data on their experiences and perceptions regarding current mining 
practices and the potential utility of smart helmets. The survey responses offered valuable insights into these miners' 
specific needs and challenges. The collected data was analysed using the IBM Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences (SPSS) to provide descriptive and inferential statistics. By applying the principles of design science 
methodology, the survey findings informed the design and development of a smart helmet tailored to the artisanal 
mining context. The resulting smart helmet integrates features such as real-time location tracking, environmental 
monitoring, health tracking and communication capabilities. This study showcases the potential of combining user-
centric design with advanced technology to address the unique requirements of artisanal miners, ultimately leading to 
safer and more efficient mining operations. The proposed smart helmet represents a significant advancement in 
leveraging technology to enhance the well-being and productivity of artisanal miners.

1. Introduction
Artisanal mining in Zimbabwe focuses on conventional mining techniques that employ simple equipment. Individuals 
or groups engage in such practices to extract minerals from the earth’s surface (Mutemeri and Ponnan 2024). In 2022, 
research found that 35% of artisanal miners in Zimbabwe experience accidents, while 25% suffer injuries, with major 
incidents including mine collapses and underground trappings (Singo et al. 2022). One recent accident was the 
Redwing mine disaster, where 15 artisanal miners were trapped when a mine shaft collapsed (The Herald 2024). These 
incidents support the necessity of attempts at improving miner safety.  
The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that enables widespread, everyday devices to connect to the 
Internet (Mutunhu 2022). Wearable technology, which refers to anything worn on the user's body for extended periods 
to provide significant enhancement to the user, integrates with IoT to deliver real-time data from sensors (Collier and 
Randolph 2015). In recent years, wearable technologies have rapidly advanced globally (Worlanyo et al. 2023). 
Wearable smart helmets with sensors and communication capabilities designed for artisanal miners have the potential 
to transform the artisanal mining industry (Kamble et al. 2023). Traditional mining practices often expose workers to 
significant risks, including toxic gases, physical injuries and poor environmental conditions (Mwandiringana and Ye

technologies will higher longevity could address battery limitations. Contextualising the study of artisanal miners’ 
experiences globally could ensure adaptability to various contexts because infrastructure and policies are different in 
each country. Focusing on cost-effective solutions, infrastructure development and user-centered design, along with 
providing comprehensive training and support, will improve usability and adoption. Collaborative efforts with 
multidisciplinary experts and mining companies will facilitate larger-scale trials and secure funding for further 
research and development. Furthermore, employing deep learning algorithms on collected sensor data could be 
leveraged to predict hazards such as methane gas build-up which result in explosions and mineshaft collapses. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This research achieved its objectives of investigating the factors influencing the adoption of smart helmets among 
artisanal miners and implementing a smart helmet equipped with IoT sensors. Our primary goal was to gather 
contextual insights necessary for the development of a helmet tailored specifically for use in the Zimbabwean artisanal 
mining context. Through a quantitative survey and the development of a prototype smart helmet system, we identified 
critical factors such as awareness, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and economic 
considerations, including price sensitivity. These findings provide essential guidance for designing technology 
solutions that effectively address the unique challenges faced by Zimbabwean artisanal miners, such as unreliable 
power supply and limited internet connectivity. By integrating theoretical insights with practical application, this study 
contributes to advancing wearable technology in artisanal mining, aiming to enhance safety and operational efficiency 
in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract 
The railway industry is complex and relies on highly skilled professionals to enhance its performance. However, it 
faces significant challenges due to a notable skill gap in critical areas such as engineering and management. A 
comprehensive literature review was undertaken to identify essential skills and strategies for addressing this gap. 
Additionally, a qualitative research study consisting of a focus group discussion with industry experts was conducted 
to establish the interrelationship between critical skills and the various strategies for addressing the skill gap through 
interpretive structural modeling. MICMAC analysis determined the driving and dependence power among the critical 
skills and strategies. The data was analyzed using Microsoft Excel. The findings revealed a strong relationship among 
the essential skills and strategies identified in the literature review and focus group discussions, all of which are 
directly related to the railway industry. The most severe skill shortages were found in civil, structural, electrical, and 
mechanical engineering. The study highlights the need for the South African railway industry to address the skill gap 
to improve its performance and meet the increasing demands of the sector.

1. Introduction
The railway transport industry is a vital economic driver in South Africa due to its environmentally friendly nature 
and its ability to efficiently transport large quantities of freight and passengers (Mukwena et al., 2019). The South 
African Rail Network Company is currently facing challenges in performance, including declining volume 
performance and failure to meet target volumes. For the 2021–2022 financial year (FY), the total volume performance 
was 172.7 million tonnes (mt), marking a 5% decrease from the previous year's total of 181.1 mt in volume 
performance (2020/2021). Moreover, the targeted volumes for FY 2021–2022 were 208.8 mt, while the actual 
achieved volumes were 172.7 mt (Transnet Railway Company, 2022). South African commuter rail companies are 
also grappling with widespread operational disruptions. The advanced age of the trains, which have surpassed their 
33-year lifespan, and a shortage of skilled workers are the primary reasons for poor service delivery in the passenger
rail industry (Chimusoro et al., 2017).
As per Galagan (2009), the existing skills gap in the workforce can impede organizational performance and hinder 
productivity. A skills gap arises when there is a shortage of necessary skills to meet company objectives, and the 
current workforce lacks the proficiency to carry out their responsibilities (Morris & Reed, 2008). Technical skills refer 
to job-specific competencies required to complete specific tasks or the ability to execute a particular task by utilizing 
the requisite skills (Green, 2005; Manjunath et al., 2019). The lack of adequate maintenance policies, plans, and 
implementations, along with a shortage of skilled personnel and skill gaps, are significant factors contributing to the 
failures in South Africa's railway infrastructure (Ramuhulu & Chiranga, 2018; Mukwena et al., 2019). According to

5.3. Proposed Improvements 
The railway companies are faced with limited resources and are unable to invest in all critical skills and strategies to 
address the skills gap simultaneously. Consequently, they must prioritize certain essential skills and techniques. The 
findings indicate that engineering skills (civil, electrical, signaling, mechanical, industrial, and structural), technical 
specialist skills, technical specification skills, and analytic skills have a greater impact on other critical skills. 
Professionals with engineering skills can also serve as technical specialists, project managers, design managers, and 
maintenance managers, in addition to possessing technical specification and analytic skills. Therefore, railway 
companies should prioritize civil, electrical, signaling, mechanical, and industrial skills, as they are crucial for 
designing, testing, maintaining railway infrastructure, and carrying out rail projects. Furthermore, electrical, 
mechanical, and industrial engineers can be involved in testing and maintaining rolling stock. The study reveals that 
train driving skills do not significantly influence other critical skills, but train drivers play a vital role in transporting 
passengers and freight. Professionals like drafters and structural engineers are primarily needed during the design and 
construction phases of projects. Consequently, companies can acquire these skills on a temporary basis as needed. 
 
Internal strategies to address the skills gap, such as succession planning, discipline-specific strategies, mentorship 
programs, workplace learning, an updated training matrix, and railway undergraduate programs, should be given 
priority, as they can be implemented internally without requiring additional funds. Performance management should 
also be prioritized to encourage skilled workers to transfer their knowledge to younger employees. On the other hand, 
recruiting the best employees and onshore skilled migrants should be of lower priority, as these initiatives will 
necessitate additional funding, which may pose challenges for other companies. 
 
5.4. Validation 
In this study, we conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify critical skills and strategies for addressing 
the skills gap in the railway industry. Additionally, we engaged experts from the railway industry to contribute any 
additional essential skills and strategies that may not have been captured in the literature review. This approach 
ensured that we met the criteria for content validity by encompassing a broad range of relevant content. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The South African railway industry is facing significant challenges due to a notable skill gap in critical areas such as 
engineering and management, leading to declining performance and failure to meet target volumes. This study aims 
to identify the technical skills gap and strategies to address it in the South African railway industry. A comprehensive 
literature review and a qualitative research study consisting of a focus group discussion with industry experts were 
conducted. Interpretive structural modeling was used to establish the interrelationship between critical skills and 
strategies, while MICMAC analysis determined the driving and dependence power among them. The findings revealed 
a strong relationship among the essential skills and strategies identified, all of which are directly related to the railway 
industry. The study concludes that railway companies must prioritize these critical skills and strategies to bridge the 
skill gap and enhance their operations and performance. The most severe skill shortages were found in civil, structural, 
electrical, and mechanical engineering, as well as in specialties such as civil, track, signaling, and electrical 
engineering. The study highlights the need for the South African railway industry to address the skill gap to improve 
its performance and meet the increasing demands of the sector.

Abstract 
As people's demands grow, so does the need for loans to meet some of them. Every day, financial institutions 
receive numerous loan applications. The financial industry faces significant challenges in managing loan defaults, 
leading to increased fraud, bad debt, and financial losses. Financial institutions frequently lack reliable methods 
for determining a loan applicant's creditworthiness, particularly in Africa. The main objective of the study is to 
develop a machine learning-based loan eligibility system that accurately predicts the creditworthiness of loan 
applicants in the African financial sector. This study addresses a critical issue in the African financial industry by 
implementing a reliable predictive model that reduces risks and informs lending decisions. The methodology 
combines Design Science Research (DSR) and the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-
DM) framework. The data used includes parameters such as the applicant's net salary, loan amount, loan term, 
credit history, and employment status. Cleaning, standardization, and dividing the dataset into training and testing 
sets were all part of the data preparation process. The Logistic Regression algorithm was utilized for model 
training, implemented in Python using the Scikit-learn library. The Logistic Regression model's performance was 
evaluated using the accuracy metric, achieving an accuracy rate of 80%. The developed machine learning model 
demonstrated high accuracy in predicting loan eligibility, indicating its potential effectiveness in real-world 
applications. The system was deployed as a web-based application using the Streamlit framework, providing an 
accessible tool for financial institutions. Future research and improvements, such as data enrichment, advanced 
analytics, and adherence to financial regulatory compliance, are necessary to further enhance the system's 
accuracy and reliability.

1. Introduction
A loan eligibility system is a web-based program designed to automate the process of determining a borrower’s 
eligibility for a loan and evaluating their creditworthiness(Wells Fargo 2023). A loan is a sum of money borrowed 
from a financial institution that is expected to be repaid with interest. People seek loans for various reasons, 
including purchasing homes, funding education, starting or expanding businesses, or managing unexpected 
expenses. To become eligible for a loan, applicants typically need to meet certain criteria, such as having a stable 
income, a good credit history, and sufficient collateral. The traditional loan approval process, which involves 
extensive manual evaluation of documents and financial histories, is both time-consuming and prone to human 
error. This inefficiency can lead to inaccuracies in assessing a borrower's eligibility and increase the risk of loan 
defaults. Despite advancements in financial technology, there is a significant gap in current research regarding the

7. Proposed Improvements 
To enhance the effectiveness of the loan prediction model, rigorous attention to data collection and quality is 
paramount. Effective data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are crucial for handling missing values, outliers, 
and inconsistencies. These steps are essential to ensure the model's performance and reliability. Moreover, 
integrating diverse external data sources, such as social media profiles and utility bills, alongside traditional 
metrics like credit history, enriches the borrower's financial profile and enhances predictive accuracy. Looking 
ahead, integration with regulatory compliance measures is crucial to adapt to evolving frameworks, necessitating 
continual adjustments to data practices and machine learning models. Proactive monitoring ensures adherence to 
regulations, mitigating compliance risks and maintaining trust with regulators and customers, thus ensuring the 
system's compliance while providing invaluable insights for lending decisions (Magar et al., 2022). 
 
8. Conclusion 
The study has demonstrated the effectiveness of employing machine learning techniques, particularly logistic 
regression, in developing a loan eligibility system capable of accurately predicting borrowers' creditworthiness. 
Through rigorous application of Design Science Research and the CRISP-DM framework, the study successfully 
addressed the prevalent issue of high loan defaults faced by financial institutions. The research evaluated and 
compared model performance using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, employing a range of machine learning 
algorithms including logistic regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, and Gaussian NB. 
Ultimately, logistic regression was chosen for deployment due to its higher accuracy. The integration of the model 
into a user-friendly web service using Streamlit represents a significant milestone, enabling real-world application 
and showcasing practical utility in identifying loan applicants likely to default.

Abstract 
The goal of this paper is to develop two physically based models to optimize the boron thermal diffusion profiles in 
novel N-type thin film monocrystalline silicon solar cells.  The first model is used to represent the boron doping 
induced strain. In this model, the strain is position dependent. The second model is used to include the effects of this 
strain on the boron diffusion coefficient. These models are both applied to investigate and optimize the effects of 
doping induced strain on boron diffusion. This original investigation will help manufacturers and researchers optimize 
doping and diffusion parameters and design more robust and highly efficient solar cells. A wide range of doping 
energies, doses, diffusion times, diffusion temperatures, and different thicknesses of the solar cell films have been 
tested and qualitatively validated with literature.  From this study, we found that the junction depth of the diffused 
boron dopant is significantly smaller under the effects of the proposed doping induced strain model. The junction 
depth of the diffused boron with the doping induced strain model is about 71% smaller than that without the doping 
induced strain.

1. Introduction
The goal of this paper is to develop two physically based models to help understand and optimize the boron thermal 
diffusion profiles in novel N-type thin film monocrystalline silicon solar cells. The first model is used to represent the 
boron doping induced strain. In this model, the strain is position dependent. The second model is used to include the 
effects of this strain on the boron diffusion coefficient. These models are both original and are applied to investigate 
and get the taste of the effects of doping induced strain on boron diffusion. As far as we know, this investigation is 
lacking in the published literature. This original investigation will help manufacturers and researchers optimize doping 
and diffusion parameters and design more robust and highly efficient thin film silicon solar cells. Thanks to their lower 
weight and reduced thickness, thin film monocrystalline silicon solar cells (TFMSSCs) are used in applications not 
suitable for traditional silicon solar cells. For example, thin film silicon solar cells are a better option for vehicles and 
vertical or curved surfaces. Thin film silicon panels typically cost around $1 to $1.50 per watt. Traditional panels cost 
around $2.85 per watt. However, TFMSSCs are still less efficient (10% to 18%) compared to traditional thick silicon 
solar cells (18% to 26%).  The aim of this paper is to investigate how to increase the efficiency of TFMSSCs by 
optimizing the boron dopant thermal diffusion processes at the fabrication level.   
1.1 Objectives 
The main objectives of this study are as follows.  The first objective is to develop an original model to 
represent the relation between the doping distribution of boron and the induced local strain in the positively 
dopant region of a thin film silicon solar cell.  The second objective is to develop a second model that will 
include the effects of doping-induced strain in the diffusion coefficient of boron dopant.  The third objective

may exist between the lattice constant of silicon in x and y directions. We think this idea will improve the accuracy of 
the proposed model. We are also planning to improve the proposed model (1) by including the effects of the diffusion

5.4 Validation  
We have tested and validated the proposed models using different doping and diffusion parameters.  We have tested 
different values of implantation doses from 1e15 to 4e15 and different values of diffusion temperatures from T=800°C 
to T=1100°C. The diffusion time was fixed to 20mn. The obtained results in Figures 5 to 9 have been compared and 
validated qualitatively with experiments and simulations results found in the published literature for similar structures 
(Ma et al.  2014). Ma et al. (2014) have studied experimentally and numerically different diffusion and oxidation 
methods of boron in textured solar cells.  Ma et al. (2014) did not study the effects of strain on diffusion as we are 
doing in this paper.  To the best of our knowledge no study has been done about the effects of doping-induced strain 
on the diffusion of dopants in published literature in the areas of solar cells or even CMOS transistors.  
 
6. Conclusion 
We have shown that the junction depth of the diffused boron dopant has been reduced by about 71% under the effects 
of the boron doping induced strain.  Then, the diffusion of boron under this compressive strain is significantly retarded 
which will impact deeply the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current of the solar cell. In the future work, we 
will investigate the output power and the efficiency of silicon solar cells under doping induced strain.

Abstract 
To thrive in the competitive market shaped by industry 4.0, businesses must embrace sophisticated data collection and 
analysis techniques. The ability to gather detailed and real-time production data is becoming crucial, not only for 
enhancing quality control but also for boosting machine efficiency. Decisions at the management level increasingly 
rely on statistics derived from such data, which is predominantly sourced from machine PLCs. These PLCs track vital 
parameters such as product values, timestamps and robot movements. In this data-driven environment, machines serve 
as pivotal information hubs, facilitating process improvements with databases acting as repositories. The industry's 
demand for a traceable product journey within the factory—to pinpoint errors and refine production methods—is met 
through advanced traceability systems. Moreover, high-frequency production zones require robust data processing 
capabilities. To address this, an Apache Kafka server is implemented, ensuring millisecond-level data transmission 
between endpoints. Apache Kafka's scalable messaging architecture enables real-time data processing and supports 
both horizontal and vertical communication, accommodating various use cases. Additionally, the integration of IT and 
operational technology (OT) brings cybersecurity into focus, assessing vulnerabilities within this interconnected 
framework. This comprehensive approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also fortifies the infrastructure 
against potential cyber threats, paving the way for a more resilient and efficient production landscape.

1. Introduction
Apache Kafka is designed to be highly scalable and as fast as real time processing data protocol. Facing modern 
problems of sending high amounts of data to multiple nodes, Kafka is providing with the help of a distributed system 
a robust way of messaging service. Originally it has been invented by the social media platform LinkedIn, which is 
known for linking companies and suitable workers. It has been aimed to only improve the data architecture on the 
platform itself to gather website data. (Ahmed 2019). Since its release to open source in 2011, it has not just 
revolutionized the efficiency of distributing information, it also has modernized data engineering as it is. Big 
technology players like Netflix, Airbnb or PayPal are basing its product on the event streaming platform and are 
therefore able to assure their services to unlimited users due to Kafkas possibility to scale (Hopfenmüller 2022). With 
its basic structure, the platform enables multiple use cases. Those are present in multiple industries like social media,

Not only are Apache Kafka insights visible on the cloud resource endpoint, but dashboards can also be generated using 
metrics from the JMX Exporter. The following chart is an example of this, showing the bytes throughput per topic on 
the Kafka Cluster. The bytes are visualized on the y-axis, whereby the topic index is on the x-axis. While the topic 
names have been censored for data privacy reasons, the chart still effectively illustrates which topics have been used 
the most. Using the JMX Exporter, these metrics are collected and presented in a user-friendly format, allowing for 
easy monitoring and analysis of Kafka cluster performance. This visualization is crucial for identifying trends, 
detecting anomalies, and making informed decisions to optimize resource allocation and improve system efficiency. 
The ability to generate such detailed dashboards empowers administrators and developers to proactively manage and 
troubleshoot their Kafka environments. Further, integrating JMX Exporter metrics with monitoring tools like 
Prometheus and Grafana can further enhance the observability of the Kafka ecosystem. This integration provides a 
seamless way to set up custom alerts and notifications, ensuring that potential issues are addressed promptly. By 
leveraging these insights, organizations can maintain high availability, reduce downtime, and ensure the reliable 
delivery of messages within their Kafka clusters (Figure 5).

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The most significant opportunity for improvement lies in advancing API development. Since all components are open 
source and contributions are made voluntarily by the community, there is no official support, making it challenging 
to rely entirely on the project's ongoing development. However, the substantial community interest and industry 
demand in this area contribute to a degree of stability in software development.  
 
Expanding the business case for Apache Kafka and its potential to enhance data architecture across various sectors 
also presents opportunities to bolster community engagement. By demonstrating its value in diverse applications, we 
can attract more contributors and encourage greater investment in the project's future. Strengthening community power 
through increased participation and collaboration will ensure the sustained growth and improvement of Apache Kafka, 
benefiting both the community and the broader industry. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research has demonstrated that Apache Kafka can be effectively integrated into an industrial environment, 
providing robust, scalable, and real-time data streaming. Kafka's distributed architecture and fault-tolerant design 
ensure high availability and reliability, essential for handling large volumes of industrial data. While the setup requires 
technical expertise, the extensive documentation and active developer community offer significant support.

Abstract 
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has foretelled a new era in the application of artificial intelligence 
for complex problem-solving and decision-making tasks. Particularly in industrial environments, where the 
challenges are high and multifaceted, the integration of advanced computational models promises significant 
improvements in operational efficiency and troubleshooting effectiveness. This paper explores the cutting-edge 
approach of employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, a revolutionary subset of LLMs, for real-
time troubleshooting in such settings. Leveraging the dynamic interplay between the generative prowess of LLMs 
and the precision of retrieval mechanisms, our proposed system is designed to provide timely, accurate, and 
contextually relevant solutions to a wide array of industrial problems. The core of our methodology involves a two-
pronged strategy: first, the retrieval component efficiently sifts through an extensive database of industrial expert 
domain knowledge, technical manuals, incident reports, and real-time sensor data, to identify relevant information to 
the issue at hand. Subsequently, the generative component synthesizes this retrieved data with its pre-trained 
knowledge base to formulate comprehensive, actionable solutions. This integration not only enriches the model's 
responses with deep, domain-specific insights but also ensures that the solutions are grounded in the latest empirical 
data and best practices. This study showcases the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models 
in industrial troubleshooting, highlighting their superiority in reducing downtime and enhancing problem resolution 
rates. It underscores the potential of integrating these models with Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide real-
time, actionable intelligence in complex environments.

Abstract 
Growing competitiveness and enhancement of automotive industries to adapt to Industry 4.0 has led to the 
development of many innovative solutions to enhance the quality of production. This can be achieved through efficient 
use of data generated by various machines involved. Data from various sensors and controllers are stored in 
Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) which can then be retrieved and stored in a centralized storage location like 
shared drives, private servers or in cloud environments. A machine learning classification model, which is trained 
using the historic data retrieved from these PLCs, can predict the quality of the final product before it reaches the final 
stage. With this approach, a part or an assembly can be taken out of the line early, thereby reducing the scrap cost and 
achieving an improved efficiency of the production. This research provides a consolidated approach that can be used 
for predictive quality.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 or Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) helps us to transition into the digital environment that provides 
enhanced capabilities like real-time decision making, increased productivity, flexibility, and agility. Artificial 
intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) have proven to be the backbone in facilitating the adoption of the 4IR. 
Although the current state is in an adolescent stage, the actual potential of this technology has not gone unseen. 
Extensive studies are ongoing in the fields of deep learning, explainable AI, graph neural networks and many more, 
to overcome the existing challenges in this field (Kim et al. 2022). These concepts are being widely used in various 
kinds of industries including the automotive industry. It is believed that to be superior to the competitors, the elements 
of 4IR are a key factor. European manufacturers are being pushed towards digital transformations due to increasing 
operating costs and the rising need to have better quality products at a low price. Asian manufacturers have already 
gained an advantage by focusing more on knowledge and Research and Development. In entirety, research work has 
increased tenfold between the years 2015 and 2021 and is still increasing. This has been observed in various fields 
ranging from smaller applications like object detection to business management applications like manufacturing 
decision making (Mueller and Mezhuyev 2022).

6 Conclusion  
The automotive industry is one of the competitive industries with growing technologies and innovations. This research 
focuses more on the tabular and structured data. But using this same approach, several types of data can be used, such 
as images, binary files, and other data and file types. For this purpose, the AI model can be tuned to perform multi-
modal analysis. Also, contemporary trends show an increase in research Advanced Driving Assistance Systems 
(ADAS), autonomous driving and manufacturing (PYMNTS 2024). This has led to a major change from the 
conventional manufacturing methods and has introduced more complexities and additional costs. To tackle this issue, 
solutions like this research would prove helpful for making the process of incorporating these complexities more 
efficient, thereby ensuring cost effectiveness. This research would provide a helping hand to the automotive 
manufacturing industries in moving towards AI aided data-driven manufacturing.

Abstract 
The choice of measuring scales and their nomenclatures are critical but should be influenced by the research 
objectives. In this research, adopting the ‘content analysis study’ approach, the ‘mirror image’ variant of the Likert 
scale, was used to critique the results from earlier research that used the standard Likert scale 1-5, where each unit 
was allocated linear positive integers. The focus was to evaluate the impact on the results of consensus-reaching 
processes (CRPs) used for addressing a group decision-making (GDM) problem among professionals in the built 
environment and can be adapted for use in the implementation of AI in conservative industries. The two measuring 
scales were identified as Scales 1 and 2 where Scale 1 is the standard Likert scale and Scale 2 is the mirror image 
scale. The results revealed that the outcome of Scale 1 progressively reduced the chosen factors, from twenty-one to 
thirteen and twelve. Similarly, the second scale, drastically reduced the same factors to nine and eight respectively. 
The emerging twelve factors from Scale 1 aptly represented the interests of the different professionals who participated 
in the exercise, compared to the eight factors from Scale 2. Thus, the former provides more suitable solutions to the 
GDM problem.

1. Introduction
In earlier research, presented in different detail at some conferences, the authors (Ogbeifun, et al., 2023; Ogbeifun and 
Pretorius, 2023) explored what the built environment professionals considered as the critical quality characteristics 
that should be evident, in what can be classified as an excellent building design, making the edifice suitable and fit for 
purpose throughout its lifecycle. The panel of built environment professionals comprising architects, builders, 
contractors, engineers, estate valuers, and quantity surveyors. Adopting the classical Delphi technique, twenty-one 
characteristics were suggested in the first round of the exercise. Using the Likert scale of 1-5, the twenty-one factors 
were reduced to twelve, after two successive iterations. The focus of this research is on using a different variant of the 
Likert scale, the ‘mirror image’, and comparing the results for addressing a group decision-making (GDM) problem 
and possible adaptation to the introduction of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in conservative industries, through 
the contextual use of the principles of consensus-reaching processes (Labella, et al., 2018).

few, to guide immediate and effective decision-making in GDM problems, such as developing a white paper from a 
committee report for immediate action. Otherwise, in the generic GDM scenario, the sharp reduction of the factors 
would infringe on the interests of some of the participants who may be discouraged from further participation in the 
exercise.  
Therefore, this research recommends that the choice of measuring scale should be influenced by the research 
objectives.

Abstract 
This paper investigates the integration of quantum computing into smart maintenance, which allows integrated 
scheduling of maintenance and production to enhance decision-making within manufacturing environments. 
Uncoordination and the lack of integrated scheduling of maintenance and production plans lead to significant 
economic inefficiencies. A literature review revealed the gap in the integration of modern and newly emerging 
quantum computing algorithms and a three-step optimization approach is proposed. The paper showcases the 
feasibility of quantum computing for smart maintenance scheduling and illustrates a way of including quantum 
computing in complex integrated scheduling problems. The approach encompasses creating an integrated production 
and maintenance schedule via simulation-based optimization and metaheuristics and applying the quantum 
approximate optimization algorithm for prescheduling maintenance tasks.

1. Introduction
Based on an empirical, inductive research approach Bokrantz et al. (2020) defined smart maintenance as ‘an 
organizational design for managing the maintenance of manufacturing plants in environments with pervasive digital 
technologies’, and according to the definition, smart maintenance consists of four dimensions: data-driven decision-
making, human capital resource, internal & external integration. One key aspect is the integration of production and 
maintenance to schedule integrated.  
The objectives of the maintenance function and production function are different and their goals are not 
complementary. Maintenance and production plans are traditionally scheduled separately, which ignores the 
interdependencies between maintenance and production, leading to significant economic losses (Kolus et al. 2020). 
The misalignment of maintenance and production schedules results in wrongly chosen maintenance time slots, which

The corresponding convergence is illustrated in Figure 8. The energies for different amounts of 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛾𝛾 parameters, 
ranging from 1 to 6 are lower and the number of evaluations is lower indicating better convergence than the CS-

WS-QAOA showed significantly better results in terms of energy, convergence and probability of best eigenstate 
compared to CS-QAOA, making it a better approach for the given problem.The initial fluctuation is smaller, indicating 
that the custom initial state superposition is better than the generic H-gate superposition. 
 
6. Conclusion and outlook 
The paper proposes an approach to implement quantum computing into smart maintenance scheduling by a three-step 
optimization approach and illustrates the feasibility of including quantum computing in smart maintenance scheduling. 
The highest utilized machine within the scheduling problem was identified and an analytical MILP model was 
formulated. Iteratively optimizing the production assets based on their utilization incorporates the assumption, that 
optimizing critical production assets is of higher priority than production assets with low criticality. The iterative 
approach reduces the complexity of the problem, and allows the usage of less qubits. 
 
A method to convert the MILP into a cost Hamiltonian was proposed and the results depending on different sets of 
𝛽𝛽 and 𝛾𝛾 as well as their convergence were presented. To improve performance a WS-QAOA approach was presented, 
implemented, and compared to CS-QAOA. The WS-QAOA showed significantly better results in terms of 
convergence, energy, and probability of finding the best eigenstate, which is important since the depth of the quantum 
circuit grows linear with the amount of 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛾𝛾 parameters. The feasible prescheduling time slots only considered 
one parameter, worker availability, which could be enhanced easily to consider more, individual parameters, such as 
required maintenance equipment, skill levels or multiple workers. The proposed MILP was formulated in a general 
way, including complex conditions to determine the elements within 𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖 can be incorporated easily. The modelling of 
the problem plays a significant role when implementing quantum computing into scheduling problems and trivial 
decision variables can be converted and included into the objective function to reduce the required amount of qubits. 
Further research could investigate the implementation of other quantum computing algorithms for smart maintenance 
scheduling, apply the approach to a real-world scenario for a manufacturing company or investigate approaches to 
efficiently deal with a high number of maintenance jobs to be considered, which could lead to a high number of 
required qubits to solve the problem.

Abstract 
We study the multi-location inventory management problem where orders are to be placed at each of multiple locations 
and inventory can be transshipped between locations. Orders placed arrive after a certain lead time, whereas 
transshipments are completed instantly. In this setting, transshipments can help to prevent stockouts that arise due to 
unexpectedly high demand, as excess demand at one location can be met by transshipping excess inventory from 
another location. The objective is to minimize the total cost, which consists of inventory costs, ordering costs and 
transshipment costs. Demand at each location is time-varying and possibly correlated, and the demand forecast is used 
by the central planner to make the ordering and transshipment decisions. We model the inventory problem as a Markov 
decision process and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to it. We show that the DRL solution performs well 
and is robust to forecast error.

Abstract 
In this study, the upstream process of the Green Hydrogen Supply Network (GHSC) is investigated, in which 
electricity from solar renewable energy is used in the electrolysis technique for the hydrogen production process. 
Initially, multiple criteria relevant to the solar plant location based on geographic, climate, and sun-earth interaction 
data are examined. In particular, seven input criteria are obtained from the area, the average air temperature, the 
average rainfall amount, the average precipitation days, the average relative humidity, the wind force, and the average 
yearly sunshine hours. Additionally, three output criteria are the population density, the direct normal irradiation, and 
the specific photovoltaic power output, respectively. Then, the case study of the state of Saxony-Anhalt in Germany 
inclusive of eleven districts and three independent cities is used as Decision-Making Units (DMUs), in which the Data 
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique is applied to explore each DMU’s relative efficiency. The obtained results 
show that about 57 percent of all the DMUs are found to be relatively efficient. The outcome of the study can be used 
to analyze strategic policy for GHSC involving the upstream and other operations in future studies.

1. Introduction
An energy crisis is considered one of the significant bottlenecks in the supply of energy resources to an economy, 
where population growth is one of the key factors that has led to a surge in the global demand for energy in recent 
years. Fossil fuel energy, in particular, has served the world for decades. However, evidence has been shown that 
fossil fuel energy greatly contributes to the increase in GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions, which could negatively 
impact human life in the long run and thus is not sustainable (Jurasz et al. 2020). Thus, there is a growing interest in 
the renewed focus on reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuel usage, in which increased attention to renewable

As presented in Table 3, the efficient locational DMUs for both Models 2 and 3 are found to be D3 (i.e., Börde (BK)), 
D4 (i.e., Burgenland (BLK)), D5 (i.e., Harz (HZ)), D7 (i.e., Mansfeld-Südharz (MSH)), D8 (i.e., Saalekreis (SK)), D9 
(i.e., Salzlandkreis (SLK)), D13 (i.e., Halle (Saale) (HAL)), and D14 (i.e., Magdeburg (MD)), respectively. That is, 
about 57% of all the evaluated DMUs for the state of Saxony-Anhalt in the case study are found to be relatively 
efficient and can serve as a benchmarking list when compared with the rest of other alternatives. It is also important 
to note that different models under evaluation depend also on the assumption of a return to scales (i.e., CRS vs. VRS 
assumptions). Additionally, it is worth emphasizing that the outcomes of this study also depend on the list of selection 
criteria under evaluation.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The success of the hydrogen economy depends on many factors and challenges regarding the economy assessment, 
technical development, sustainability evaluation, and performance evaluation for the key operations in the hydrogen 
supply chain. In this study, our focus is on the evaluation of the upstream process of the green hydrogen supply chain, 
in which the source of renewable energy is used rather than other non-renewable sources of energy. That is, the focus 
on solar energy is under investigation. In this study, we highlight the application of the DEA technique for evaluating 
potential locations for solar energy plants under multiple criteria using a case study in Germany. Our analyzed results 
can be strategically used to enhance not only a geographic-based case study but also provide analysis guidelines for 
policymakers and practitioners interested in GHSC. We note also that this is the first phase of our ongoing studies to 
compare and contrast policies between Germany and Thailand case studies in the GSHC framework and to model the 
GHSC network involving the upstream, the midstream, and the downstream operations.  
 
Future research directions are suggested for three folds. That is, the first direction is to use the outcome from this study 
as input to the development of a model for analyzing hydrogen networks involving the upstream, the midstream, and 
the downstream operations, which is an ongoing research framework. The second direction is to verify and validate 
the results from this study with existing plans of the governmental units related to solar energy plan. Furthermore, the 
third direction for future research is to enhance the reliability of this study by also integrating the DEA technique with 
other MCDA tools as well as by comparing the findings with other studies and case studies.

Abstract 
Digital transformation stems from Industry 4.0 and has introduced innovation across various industries and 
businesses. Digital transformation requires the integration of Operational Technology (OT) and Information 
Technology (IT) company departments (Hicking et al. 2021). IT/OT integration results include increased 
productivity, reduced waste, decreased labour and energy expenditures, and improved maintenance. Traditionally, 
IT is about data creation, storage, and security within an organization, while OT is about the physical world 
processes, such as overseeing productivity, personnel, and machinery. With the integration of IT and OT, the 
boundaries between the two have become blurred.  (Kuppusammy and Mariappan  2021). However, because of 
this connectivity, the once-isolated systems are now vulnerable to various new threats (Cook et al. 2017). 
Individuals and industries are adapting to internet connectivity for nearly all devices. Recent forecasts indicate 
that 70 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2025. OT devices and systems utilized in critical 
infrastructures, such as energy distribution, water management, nuclear facilities, and manufacturing, also 
embrace this connectivity trend (Alrumaih et al. 2023). An increase in IT/OT integration has led to a rise in 
cybercrimes in OT systems. Cybersecurity standards are created to assist organisations in meeting cybersecurity 
goals and preventing cybercrimes (Taherdoost 2022). With the integration of IT and OT, organisations need to 
protect both IT and OT networks by implementing the correct standards. This paper will highlight the security 
requirements for IT and OT and the most appropriate standards to use for an IT/OT converged environment

1. Introduction
OT oversees and regulates physical processes, equipment, and industrial operations. It includes hardware and 
software technologies utilized for monitoring and controlling machinery in real-time. OT is dedicated to the 
practical management and control of physical assets (Bwatiramba 2023). OT networks and systems include 
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) (Murray et al. 2017). 
OT systems are found in various industrial sectors such as manufacturing, energy, mining, water, pharmaceutical, 
and transportation. Examples of OT tasks include regulating temperature in power plants, controlling robots on 
manufacturing lines, and managing controllers at mining sites (Bwatiramba 2023). IT is the resources utilized by 
a firm for data processing and management, including hardware, Software, communications (voice, data, video), 
and associated personnel. Information Technology includes the capabilities of computers, software applications, 
and telecommunications (Victoria 2020). Hiroo Kanamaru (2021) came up with Table 1 to differentiate IT and 
OT characteristics.

Based on Table 7, it is clear that no one standard can apply both to the IT and OT environment, and a 
combination of standards needs to be used to secure an integrated environment.  
 
5. Discussions 
An IT/OT integrated environment does not necessarily mean one set of standards for cyber security 
implementation. Industries need to assess risk in their organisations and select standards based on risk evaluations. 
Table 7 is a good starting point for industries with industrial control systems that need to be protected, as it 
simplifies which standards to use and where. Where there is an option of using more than one standard, the 
organisation can choose standards based on regulations that apply to the organisation. It is also advised that during 
the initial phase of the implementation of standards, not more than two standards are used. This will simplify the 
implementation phase for IT and OT departments. 
  
The terminologies used in the standards can create a gap for employees unfamiliar with the environments. For 
example, IT people working in the OT environment may not be familiar with the OT terminology and vice versa. 
As mentioned in the literature review, IT and OT have different priorities; by understanding the priorities and 
cyber risks of the different levels in an IT/OT environment, the necessary and required security measures are put 
in place. The understanding and implementing Table 7 can have a positive cultural and security outcome for the 
organisation.  
 
6. Future Directions and Conclusion 
Based on the Literature findings, we can conclude that the IT and OT environments are different regarding 
priorities, infrastructure, and culture; however, threats occurring in the OT environments have made it essential 
for IT and OT to work together to reduce cybercrimes. The selection and implementation of standards phase is the 
best phase to start from.  
 
Cybersecurity standards assist organisations in meeting cybersecurity requirements and reducing cyber-attacks. 
Cyber security standards have their own goals, whether it’s for data protection, system architecture protection, 
equipment protection, or the protection of personnel (Taherdoost 2022). Cybersecurity standards are selected 
based on the purpose and the environment. This paper was meant to highlight the differences Between IT Security 
and OT Security standards and illustrate the approaches to securing IT and OT systems using the best-fit standards.  
It is important to note that some of the standards and best practices implemented in the IT domain can benefit the 
OT environment; however, this must be done with caution, as some IT practices can cause production issues in 
the OT environment. Understanding and implementing Table 7 can have a positive outcome for the organisation. 
Apart from increasing cyber security, it can potentially lead to an improved culture between IT and OT 
departments and accelerate digital transformation or IT/OT convergence. It is proposed that further studies be 
carried out to prove the positive benefits of using the best cyber security standards based on the environment of 
implementation.

Abstract 
In the contemporary business landscape, marked by intense competition, organizations continually seek innovative 
strategies to elevate efficiency and achieve heightened productivity. This quantitative research investigates the 
influence of cross-functional information sharing facilitated by Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system 
integration on productivity within typical small-medium pharmaceutical company. Grounded in the foundational 
framework of DeLone and McLean (1992), the study examines the intricate relationships between ERP system 
integration, cross-functional information sharing, and resultant productivity improvements. Data was primarily 
sourced from a survey administered across various departments within DAS Pharma Plc, to help the research explore 
the extent of ERP system integration, cross-functional information-sharing practices, and perceived productivity 
enhancements. The research findings hold significant implications for DAS Pharma Plc and the broader 
pharmaceutical industry, emphasizing the role of ERP systems in fostering effective communication and collaboration 
across organizational functions. The research also contributes empirically to both theoretical and practical knowledge 
as it attempts to explain the nuanced relationships between ERP system integration, cross-functional information 
sharing, and productivity enhancement. The insights gained offer strategic guidance for optimizing operations and 
attaining sustainable competitive advantages in the dynamic small-medium pharmaceutical sector.

1. Introduction
The adoption of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems has become widespread across industries, particularly 
in the pharmaceutical sector. ERP systems integrate core business processes by offering real-time data and analysis 
for informed decision-making (Yen, Chou and Chang 2002). In the pharmaceutical industry (at the global level), these 
systems show promise in improving supply chain management as they streamline production and enhance decision-
making (Madu and Madu 2003). Despite the global surge in ERP system usage and the inherent benefits, there remains 
a disparity in the system’s implementation between developed and developing countries due to cost, awareness, and 
technical expertise (Bitsini 2015). Challenges such as regulatory complexity and data security concerns, especially in 
developing countries like Ghana, hinder seamless ERP integration (Kanulla 2021, Al-Debei and Al-Lozi 2012).

for cross-functional information exchange enhanced project management efficiency in the pharmaceutical industry, 
ultimately boosting productivity. 
 
The calculations (table 2 and 3) further reveal a significant and positive impact of integrating ERP systems, specifically 
in facilitating impact of cross-functional information sharing (IESIS), on Service Quality (PServQ). Supported by a 
positively signed coefficient of 0.314 and a Critical Ratio (C.R.) value of 4.499, these findings indicate a substantial 
influence. The statistical significance is robust, with a p-value of 0.000, well below the specified significance threshold 
of 0.05. This supports H3 of this research. 
 
Additionally, the numbers on Table 2 and 3 reveal a significant and positive impact of integrating ERP systems, 
particularly in enhancing system quality (PSysQ), on Productivity. Supported by a positively signed coefficient of 
1.004 and a Critical Ratio (C.R.) value of 4.902, these findings highlight a substantial influence. The statistical 
significance is robust, with a p-value of 0.000, well below the specified significance threshold of 0.05. This is 
consistent with Beheshti and Beheshti’s (2010) discovery of a positive correlation between ERP systems and increased 
organizational productivity. 
 
Furthermore, the analysis (table 2 and 3) reveals a significant and positive impact of integrating ERP systems, 
particularly in enhancing Information Quality of ERP (PInfQ), on the Productivity (IEP). Evidenced by a positively 
signed coefficient of 0.520 and a Critical Ratio (CR) value of 4.616, these findings indicate a substantial influence. 
Additionally, the statistical significance is robust, with a p-value of 0.000, well below the specified significance 
threshold of 0.05. This aligns with the study by Hunton et al. (2003) and Lippincott and Reck (2003), which found 
that companies implementing ERP systems exhibited higher levels of productivity compared to those that did not 
utilize such systems. 
 
Finally, the Tables (2 and 3) demonstrate a significant and positive impact of integrating ERP systems, especially in 
enhancing Service Quality of ERP (PServQ), on the Productivity. Indicated by a positively signed coefficient of 0.157 
and a Critical Ratio (CR) value of 1.16, these results suggest a notable influence. The statistical significance is also 
strong, with a p-value of 0.024, which is lower than the specified significance threshold of 0.05. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The case study investigated the impact of integrating Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems on productivity at 
DAS Pharma Plc (a typical SME pharmaceutical company in Ghana). The study examines three key factors: the 
influence of ERP on system quality (PSysQ), information quality of ERP (PInfQ), and service quality of ERP (PServQ) 
in relation to the productivity of DAS Pharma (IEP). 
 
The findings consistently demonstrate a significant and positive impact of ERP integration on various aspects of the 
organisation. Notably, ERP's contribution to system quality, information quality, and service quality is supported by 
robust statistical significance, as indicated by positive signed coefficients, Critical Ratio (CR) values, and p-values. 
These results align with existing research, including studies by Li et al. (2017), Modgil and Sharma (2017), and 
Beheshti and Beheshti (2010), confirming a positive correlation between ERP systems and enhanced organizational 
productivity. 
 
In conclusion, the case study affirms the effectiveness of leveraging ERP systems for productivity enhancement at 
SMEs such as DAS Pharma Plc. The significant and positive impacts on system quality, information quality, and 
service quality underscore the strategic importance of ERP integration in pharmaceutical operations. The findings do 
not only contribute to the growing body of knowledge on ERP systems integration but also provide empirical and 
practical insights for organizations aiming to improve productivity through technology adoption. As businesses 
continue to navigate competitive landscapes, the study reinforces the value of ERP as a key enabler for sustainable 
productivity gains in the pharmaceutical sector.

Abstract 
Shop Floor Management (SFM) is of high importance in manufacturing companies. This article describes the concept 
of SFM from the viewpoint of industrial practice to develop a model of maturity levels regarding the degree of digital 
transformation of SFM. This model can not only be used to assess the current maturity of the SFM within a company. 
It can also be applied to introduce SFM where no structured SFM has been present in the past and develop it step by 
step to the last level of a digitally integrated SFM of the future. By validating the model on the example of TRUMPF, 
an insight is given in the status of SFM in the industry.

1. Introduction
Shop Floor Management (SFM) is well established in many companies (Pötters et al. 2018). It links what is physically 
happening on the shop floor to the sphere of management. To manufacturing companies, it is of such high relevance, 
that one will find at least elements of shopfloor management in every manufacturing company, even if they are not 
labeled as SFM. The maturity however will vary.With the progress of digital tools new possibilities and challenges 
for the practice of SFM arise. The authors report from their own operational shop floor experience and their work as 
consultants.  
1.1 Objectives 
This paper describes the understanding and requirements for SFM from the perspective of industrial practice. It aims 
at establishing a framework for the development from first elements to a digitally integrated shop floor management. 
This framework consists of three stages, that must be passed to arrive at the highest level. By describing a vision for 
a digitally integrated shopfloor management it aims at sparking ideas for further research.  
2.1 Definition, goals and concept of shop floor management 
Shop floor management can be defined as “leadership on the site of value creation” (VDI 2013, Metternich et al. 
2024). In the industry many associate the term shop floor management primarily with SFM-meetings held in 
369","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Integrated software framework 
The biggest issue today is still the lack of connections between different digital tools like ERP, MES etc. The data 
from all these systems needs to be integrated and presented in SFM in order to enable managers to make decisions 
based on the actual status of production. Only with this integration the maturity level of a digitally integrated SFM is 
achieved. With the integration of the approaches described above, SFM can be improved beyond what is possible 
without digital tools.  
 
4. Validation of the maturity levels through application on TRUMPF 
To validate the maturity levels described above, they are applied on TRUMPF. This also illustrates the levels better, 
gives some insights into the current level of SFM at TRUMPF and is a show case of typical problems. 
When trying to assess the current situation the first insight is that the overall picture is very heterogeneous. The levels 
of digital maturity of the SFM of a group, a department or a plant is not only different from plant to plant, but also 
within plants or departments. 
 
There is a tendency that the first level of SFM which is between workers and the first line of managers is more analog 
than the others. In many cases the digital literacy of workers and their access to digital systems is still low. This makes 
a paper based physical board more accessible. On this level the need for flexibility is also often higher. Certain issues 
might be tracked in the SFM only for a limited time while they are relevant. Differences between groups (products, 
processes, …) require different KPIs and visualizations (e. g. machining vs. assembly). The positive effects of the 
visibility of the information on a physical SFM board right at the place of value creation are high, because the area 
that is covered is typically smaller than on the higher levels. There are also hybrids where some of the information is 
on digital screens while other topics are on physical boards.  
 
On the department or plant level many different groups or departments need to be integrated, which leads to a higher 
degree of standardization in KPIs. This stability makes it easier to implement digital tools. SFM on the department or 
plant level is mostly on the second maturity level of digitized SFM. Mainly Power BI is used to visualize data from 
SAP and manually added data (e. g. accidents, attendance). Such no-code or low-code solutions based on standard 
software are very useful because they can be adapted by many people in the organization and are cheaper than 
individual solutions (Alt et al. 2019).  
 
Examples for the third level of digitally integrated SFM are still rare. Data acquisition in such a surrounding is 
generally manual: Most of the production at TRUMPF is manual and complex assembly in small numbers with long 
assembly times. Methods and tools to create data automatically under such circumstances are a promising field for 
future research. For collaboration Microsoft Teams or Jira are in use, but are mostly only loosely connected to SFM. 
While some fragmented examples exist for the connection of such tools, the main challenge remains to have an 
integrated software framework for all data created and used in production through ERP, MES, Live Location Tracking, 
and the like.   
 
5. Conclusion 
While digital tools will not be able to replace SFM because of its inherent nature as “leadership on the site of value 
creation”, it can be enhanced by digital tools. For the development of digital tools, it is very important to include the 
perspective of how the tools will be used. In the cases where digital tools are used to collect new data or to analyze 
existing data, SFM will often be where the results are monitored, and action is taken. When real-time alerts or 
predictions enable us to be become more proactive, or new tools increase our ability to cooperate, these tools must be 
integrated in the existing SFM structure in order to become effective.  
 
In summary it can be stated that a SFM that makes no use of digital tools does not use its full potential. On the other 
hand, digital tools that are not well integrated in SFM are very likely to lack effect and impact on production, 
because this is where action is taken on a daily basis. Only a close integration of SFM and digital tools in an 
integrated digital software framework will tap the full potential of both.

Abstract 
The fourth industrial revolution is urging the traditional manufacturing sector to explore the potential of digital twin 
(DT) technology for digitalization, optimized production, and sustainable manufacturing practices. Digital twins 
provide a way to support decision-making towards efficient production and cost saving using the digital version of a 
physical asset. In the literature, several studies are available focusing on the connection between digital twin 
technology and intelligent manufacturing. However, the literature lacks information about how digital twin technology 
complements sustainability in manufacturing. There is unexplored potential in how digital twin technology can 
contribute to advancing sustainable manufacturing practices by providing real-time monitoring and process 
optimization, resulting in lower environmental impacts. The presented study explores digital twin technology 
concerning the sustainability aspects of the manufacturing sector. Real-time monitoring and analysis of a digital 
manufacturing system provide an opportunity to optimize energy, reduce waste, minimize failures and maintenance 
needs, and enhance supply chain efficiency. The current study reviews DT technology with respect to various aspects 
of sustainable manufacturing, such as reduction in energy consumption, reduction in waste streams, maintenance and 
failure prediction, supply chain aspects, and design for sustainability (DFS). The study will provide futuristic 
recommendations to help manufacturers meet their sustainability goals.

1. Introduction
Digital technologies are gaining popularity in different industrial sectors such as energy, automotive, manufacturing, 
waste management, and aerospace etc. to address the challenges associated with real-time monitoring, data 
governance, decision making, and complex data integration etc. Among other digital technologies, digital twin has 
shown immense potential to solve these said challenges (Ali et al. 2022). Digitalization has been realized as a strong 
enabler for the industry 4.0. Digital Twin is an exact digital version or data-driven virtual replica of a physical system. 
This digital copy is linked with the physical system using real-time data monitoring, and has ability to simulate the 
behavior and its performance. With the advent of Industrial internet of things (IIoT), digital twin has emerged as 
potential transformative force to address the linkage between virtual and physical spaces. Digital twin can also predict

• Digital twin and maintenance appear to be reducing machine or equipment downtimes and increase Remaining 
Useful Life (RUL) which is very promising. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) appear to be missing out on 
benefits of Digital Twin for maintenance. Researchers need to divert attention towards SMEs in this regard.  
• There is a clear need for high level reference ontological model for maintenance for and Digital Twins. This is 
because a standard model or detailed reference model may not fit for all. An ontological approach on this regard 
should be explored. Researchers within the field of Digital Twins for maintenance need to broadly focus on 
predicative maintenance and digital twins.  
• Narrowed down area of research within predictive maintenance will require extensive review with focus on 
technical detailed rather than statistical focus as found in most reviews. A reference framework or model for 
maintenance and digital twins is largely missing and should be focused on to avoid dispersed research efforts. 
• Future research can focus on implementing Digital Twin technology in real-life use case scenarios. The 
identification and use of appropriate Digital Twin tools are key to the success of implementation.

Abstract 
In float glass production, thermomechanical stresses that develop during the cooling process critically affect product 
quality. Deviations from the optimal parameters often lead to significant production losses. Currently, this process is 
manually controlled, which is error-prone due to the complexity and interconnectivity of the parameters involved. In 
this work, we explore the use of process data to predict thermomechanical stresses in the cooling area. Our approach 
began with an analysis of this data to identify key features, followed by data cleaning to prepare for AI applications. 
We then trained various AI models, adjusting their hyperparameters to optimize performance. These models were 
benchmarked to select the most effective one, iteratively focusing on models that delivered superior benchmark results 
until a final model was established. Our research demonstrates promising results, with the potential for initial prototype 
testing. Implementing this model could streamline quality control, enhance output optimization, and, if extended to 
automatically control the cooling process, could substantially reduce production losses. Such advancements could 
significantly impact global glass production.

1. Introduction
Float glass production is a method used to create flat, uniform sheets of glass, which are essential for windows, mirrors, 
and other applications. The process begins with melting a batch of raw materials in a furnace. The molten glass is then
poured onto a bath of molten tin, forming a continuous ribbon of glass. As it moves along, the glass enters a cooling
canal where it is gradually cooled to relieve internal stresses, which are critical for maintaining quality. These stresses
must be controlled to avoid problems during the cutting process, where large deviations can cause difficulties.
Traditionally, stress levels are monitored using expensive and time-consuming measurement equipment that can adjust 
the cooling temperature. Previous attempts to predict stress using a numerical model based on simulated temperature
measurements were not effective in real-time; predictions were made only after the glass had already exited the
production line.

Figure 5. Comparison between model and real data 
 
Since the calculation of the MSE and MAE are quite similar, a first guess might be that their ranking is equal. This is 
not the case, as model 2 and model 5 show different ranks. It can also be seen that the MAE of these two models have 
very close values which should indicate more outliers on model 5 since its MSE is worse here. The rank of the “Outlier 
Indicator” shows that perfectly, as model 5 has the lowest rank here. 
 
The R² shows the same ranking as the MSE, even the gaps between the models in are similar in both metrics. The 
variance of errors shows a ranking equal to the MAE but a closer look on the models 2 and model 5 shows that their 
values are very close. In this case, the ranks between these two models in this metrics do not mean much and should 
be treated carefully. This also mean, that all columns need to be inspected thoroughly to get an indication of the model 
that performs the best. 
 
The predictions of the best models indicated by the previous metrics are then plotted together with the real target 
values. In picture 5 the results of model nr. 1 is shown. The comparison of predictions (blue) and real target values 
(black) show that most of the predictions are close to the reality. To get a better understanding of jumps in the stress 
values, the glass thickness (grey) is plotted on the right y-axis. The predictions for the thickness 20 and 24 are a little 
off the actual values. Possible reason for that is, that the training and validation data set consists of mostly 6 mm, 8 
mm and 12 mm thickness, since those are the most produced glass thicknesses. Even though the AI has very limited 
knowledge of the 16 mm production, the predictions are still pretty accurate. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study analysed extensive amounts of data from a float glass plant, including nearly 400 million measured 
temperature values and approximately 200 million thermomechanical stress values. No direct relationship was found

between the absolute temperatures and the stress values across different analyses. However, clear correlations were 
found when the deltas of the temperatures were compared with the stress values. 
 
An important step was the data preparation, in which unrealistic and erroneous data series were identified and 
corrected. The normalisation of the data and a precise assignment of the stress and temperature data made it possible 
to create a data series that could be used for AI development.  
 
Over 1000 models from 145 different combinations were trained to identify hyperparameters that influence model 
performance. Factors such as the number of training data, the learning rate, the batch size and the number of neurons 
had a significant impact on model accuracy. The optimal configuration for the best performing model included a batch 
size of 16, two hidden layers with 300 neurons each, a dynamic learning rate of 10-3 with a gamma of 0.9, the ReLU 
activation function and the MSE as a loss function. This model achieved a loss of 0.007202 on the test data set and a 
coefficient of determination of R²=0.728, indicating that it can explain a large part of the variance of the target variable. 
Despite some outliers, the model was able to accurately represent the trend of the target data. The best AI model, 
which has already achieved precise predictions with unseen data, is now to be tested in real production conditions. By 
integrating the model as a background application in the production plant, improvements can be made to the AI 
training if the results deviate. Additional experiments with hyperparameters, such as more finely adjusted learning 
rates, a delayed start epoch for the dynamic learning rate and an individual number of neurons per layer, could help to 
further reduce losses. 
 
In addition, the data preparation can be refined by dividing the glass band into more zones, which could enable more 
precise predictions of the AI model. Updating the training data with more recent production data could also help to 
improve the model results. 
 
For the practical application of AI in production, it is necessary to define critical stress values for glass quality and to 
assess when stress jumps cause problems. A suitable evaluation system is essential for the sensible use of AI. The 
successful implementation of these steps could significantly optimise glass production by improving the quality of 
production and reducing scrap costs. The ability to predict thermomechanical stresses and make production 
adjustments in real time would increase efficiency and minimise the production of unusable glass.

Abstract 
This study investigates sustainability practices' impact on resource efficiency in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 
in Ghana, employing a comprehensive framework encompassing environmental and social dimensions, facilitating 
conditions, innovative practices, and technological innovativeness. Through a survey of 462 manufacturing SMEs, 
the research provides nuanced insights into the complex relationships between sustainability practices and their effects 
on resource efficiency. Findings reveal four sustainable paths: the first underscores the significance of environmental 
dimensions and facilitating conditions in the absence of strong social dimensions and innovative practices. The second 
emphasizes the importance of environmental and facilitating conditions, even with low technological innovativeness. 
The third and fourth paths highlight the role of social dimensions and technological innovativeness as core conditions, 
supported by innovative practices. Additionally, two topologies are identified, illustrating the integration of 
environmental and social dimensions with facilitating conditions, and the combination of technological innovativeness 
with social dimensions and innovative practices. The study contributes to the discourse on sustainability in SMEs, 
emphasizing the need for reduced resource consumption, conservation, efficient production, circular economy 
principles, and waste minimization. Ultimately, achieving SDG 8.4 by 2030 for global resource efficiency relies on 
implementing these sustainable paths. The research adds depth to understanding sustainability practices among SMEs, 
shedding light on how various factors interact to improve resource management. It offers practical insights for 
policymakers and practitioners seeking to enhance sustainability in SMEs, emphasizing the importance of a holistic 
approach that considers multiple dimensions of sustainability.

Abstract 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) poses a significant health hazard in homes, particularly during winter when traditional heating 
methods, such as wood burning, are prevalent. These methods often lead to elevated CO2 levels, increasing the risk 
of respiratory issues and even fatalities. To address this critical concern, we introduce a novel ventilation system 
designed to effectively regulate CO2 levels and ensure a safe indoor environment. The system comprises a CO2 sensor, 
a temperature sensor, a fan, a yellow light indicator, and an automatic window opener. It operates under two scenarios: 
Scenario 1: Mechanical ventilation only: The fan operates to circulate air within the room when CO2 levels reach a 
predetermined threshold and the outdoor temperature is less than 17°C. Scenario 2: Combined mechanical and natural 
ventilation: The fan operates, and the window automatically opens when CO2 levels reach the threshold and the 
outdoor temperature is higher than 17°C. A computational simulation was employed to realistically depict the system's 
operational concept. The simulation tracked both carbon dioxide (CO2) movement within the room and the system's 
response to predefined CO2 concentration thresholds established by European regulations. The simulations 
demonstrate the system's effectiveness in reducing CO2 levels to safe limits within a reasonable timeframe. The 
simulations also highlight the benefits of combined mechanical and natural ventilation in optimizing energy efficiency 
and maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures. The proposed ventilation system offers a promising solution to 
mitigate the health risks associated with elevated CO2 levels in homes, particularly during winter when traditional 
heating methods are employed. Its adaptability to varying CO2 concentrations and external temperatures ensures a 
safe and comfortable indoor environment.

reduction, enhancing indoor air quality and addressing health risks associated with CO2 accumulation. The system 
offers a sustainable solution for wood-heated homes and can integrate with existing heating systems affordably. Future 
research should explore AI and machine learning to optimize performance further to back up the conclusions and 
recommendations obtained from the first probations, further research will be conducted. Partnership with specialists 
and practical studies will be the amplifier that intensifies the understanding of the subject, consequently, improving 
the accuracy of this project`s representation, the study tries to go beyond the initial research and experiments and 
investigates some other features of the design. Through this exploration, we can reach a more detailed knowledge of 
how traditional wood-fired heating affects pollution levels, air quality, and the health of people. Promoting awareness 
and adopting smart heating technologies can lead to a healthier and more sustainable future, particularly in regions 
reliant on wood heating.

Abstract 
This research aims to enhance the existing methods for assessing the sustainability of various transit buses. It integrates 
life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) with multi-criteria decision-making. Thirteen bus brands are evaluated 
for their macro-level sustainability impacts. Two scenarios for bus end-of-life (EoL) are considered: recycling in China 
and India. The study assesses all bus types' environmental, social, and economic impacts, identifying optimal 
distributions for each scenario. A compromise programming model is developed to determine the best mix of 
alternative vehicles, considering the importance of different sustainability indicators and study scope. The study also 
explores the total impacts of global supply chains on these distributions. Findings indicate that Compressed natural 
gas (CNG) buses recycled in India are most favorable. With environmental indicators prioritized, the ideal mix is 
mostly Swedish CNG, with a small percentage of Indian CNG, both recycled in India. However, if economic indicators 
are prioritized, Indian CNG buses recycled in China dominate the fleet. For social indicators, Turkish CNG recycled 
in India comprises the majority. In a balanced scenario, Swedish CNG recycled in India forms over 95% of the 
distribution.

1. Introduction
Transport and the environment are dynamically intertwined in a contradictory way. While there are undoubtedly 
positive social and economic effects, public transportation also negatively impacts the environment. Carbon emissions 
as a percentage of total emissions have risen since both population and economic expansion have led to a sharp rise in 
the proportion of people who utilize transportation services (Fernández-Amador et al., n.d.). The transportation industry 
releases millions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) annually, accounting for around 25%-30% of the global total (IEA, 
2018). Compared to the average yearly rise of 1.9% seen since 2000, total transportation emissions have fallen below 
0.5% in 2019. Still, international transportation accounts for 21% of 2018's total CO2 emissions, as reported by the 
International Energy Agency (IEA) (IEA, 2018). Regarding transportation, road vehicles account for more than 74% 
of CO2 emissions or 15% of overall CO2 emissions (International Organization of Motor Manufacturers, n.d.). Many 
social, economic, and environmental benefits should accrue from adopting a sustainable transportation system, which 
in turn helps to advance sustainable development objectives. Developed nations all over the globe are working hard to 
find a solution to the problem of sustainable development's inherent tension with environmental degradation. Modern 
technology and alternative fuels are being incorporated progressively into transportation fleets as part of a worldwide

5. Conclusion  
This article demonstrated the advantages of integrating MCDM models with the LCSA framework to show how 
quantifiable sustainability indicators may be utilized for policy objectives; aligning with the compromise 
programming model could help generate optimal distribution for alternative vehicles by different environmental and 
socio-economic weights. Furthermore, the suggested compromise programming model's findings demonstrated that 
optimum solutions shift when the relative importance of environmental and socio-economic factors changes. The 
appropriate mix of alternative vehicles is a dynamic issue that calls for multi-stage solutions and evaluations of future 
circumstances. The overall findings indicate that the optimum distributions of the twenty-six options over the sixteen-
weight scenarios clearly favor the CNG buses that have been recycled in India. In the scenario where environmental 
impacts are given supreme importance with 100% priority, the best fleet mix consists of 99% of the Sweden CNG bus 
recycled in India and 1% of the CNG made and recycled in India. However, when economic factors are prioritized, 
the Indian CNG bus, recycled in China, comprises 100% of the fleet. Despite this, when all the priority weight is put 
on the social parameters, the Turkish CNG recycled in India makes up more than 90% of the bus fleet. And last, in 
the scenario of balanced weighting, the Swedish CNG that was recycled in India accounts for more than 95% of the 
distribution. This research aims to provide a workable strategy incorporating hybrid LCSA and multi-objective 
optimization with different fixed weights to allocate the optimal transit bus distribution for Qatar. The authors also 
suggest separating the local impacts -that occur inside Qatar- in the optimization analysis from the Global supply chain 
impacts, which could give a different fleet distribution that serves the benefit of Qatar.

Abstract 
Workplaces in production contexts are subject to various changes due to automation and robotics. Apart from the 
expected positive effects on the safety and health of workers, there is also evidence that prolonged supervisory control 
can lead to increased cognitive workload (e.g., sustained attention and error detection) as well as biomechanical stress 
(e.g., unfavorable body postures). We present methods for an objective measurement of cognitive/emotional and 
biomechanical load, such as eye or motion tracking as well as subjective measures. We discuss that for an integrative 
and comprehensive examination of workload, methods are needed that represent levels individually as well as the 
interaction of different measures. Exemplary results from laboratory studies indicate that individual prioritization 
processes lead to a negative impact either on posture and movement or on cognitive performance. We argue that this 
methodology is suitable for the implementation in the production context as the learnings can be used for the 
ergonomic improvement of workplaces, as well as for process optimization, for example in production planning. There 
is also a great need at the organizational level to generate objective data for measuring the social impact for social life 
cycle assessments. This could be another application for the suggested methodological approach.

Abstract 
As global markets increasingly demand sustainability and circular economy concepts are on the rise, products have to 
change as well. In this state of research paper, we discuss effects of circular economy concepts on production. Our 
research consists of four pillars. Due to circular economy, products or their components will be more often brought to 
a second life and thus their design should be more modular to allow efficient composing and decomposing. Second, 
the flexibility of production needs to increase to allow for the integration of dis- and reassembly steps. As a basis, we 
discuss how circular production layouts will change as products and components are reintegrated into production. 
Thirdly, this increase in complexity requires more elaborate information systems support. We discussed requirements 
and we present a software-based optimization approach for production layout planning. Fourth, IT platforms enable 
new ways to reach customers and more flexible business models. Thus, traditional production companies can innovate 
and transform towards providing industrial goods services. Finally, we present how we want to illustrate our intended 
research based on a model factory.

1. Introduction
Environmental effects such as global warming and biodiversity reduction put pressure on humanity to act more 
sustainably. Current linear production and consumption models foster those effects as more resources and energy is 
needed in contrast to longer product lifetimes and today’s economy is still mainly noncircular (Kirchherr et al. 2023). 
This is also true for industrial productions. They are mostly in a linear, unidirectional way, whereby raw materials and 
new components are processed and assembled to new products. A return of products to the factory after use is rarely 
intended, and thus in most cases no reintegration of components of discarded products is possible. This results in 
inefficient use or waste of valuable resources (Reike et al. 2022). Applying concepts of the circular economy (CE) 
can contribute as a countermeasure by different design, use and production of products. In terms of production-related 
goals, predominately they are energy, emissions, water, and material consumption. According to Öfele et al. (2023) 
becoming better in these goals, in many cases align well with the production-logistical goals on-time delivery, lead

products. Finally, we shortly discussed that enhancements in employing ICT systems can open new business models 
for production companies.  
 
As practical impact, our research shall give guidance on the change of productions system towards CE. We showed a 
way for the integration of reuse of discarded products within manufacturing settings and the resulting new 
requirements for product design, production systems, planning and ICT systems. Producing companies can further 
steer their production towards CE based on the insights of the intended research. Furthermore, for software providers 
the research on the requirements for ICT systems for CE can act as reference points for further development of these 
systems. Finally, our intended research shall show producing companies alternative ways (and necessary ICT systems) 
for placing their products on the market. 
 
While this contribution shows the current state of our research and outlines a way forward in the mentioned research 
areas, there is also potential for additional research in related topics. First, our ICT perspective focusses on ERP, 
planning and services-oriented systems. Further research could also cope with other ICT systems such as digital twin 
systems and how they can be employed or enriched which additional data and functionalities. Second, another target 
for research is to evaluate their feasibility, scalability, and impact on profitability, sustainability metrics and 
consumption models. This could be supported by further simulation and optimization modeling: For instance, 
developing simulation models to simulate different scenarios and strategies for optimizing resource efficiency, waste 
reduction, and economic performance in circular production systems. Third, we proposed layout optimization models 
for factories coping with a combined dis- and reassembly. As not all factories can be extended, one must consider 
combining dis-/reassembly factories with production factories. This could also be subject to optimization and be an 
extension of our optimization model.

Abstract 
Implementation of TQM in an organization requires organization-wide efforts. These efforts are supported by strategic 
human resources management practices (SHRMPs) through the establishment of a culture of continuous improvement 
and teamwork in an organization. In this paper, 09 key SHRM practices identified from a systematic literature review 
are modeled using the Interpretive Structural Modeling technique. ISM model presents the graphical picture of the 
preferential order of these practices along with the identification of driving and dependence potential essential to the 
implementation of TQM in an organization. The ISM modeling of SHRMPs reveals that Leadership Commitment 
(LC), Employee Recognition and Reward (ERR), and Measurement and Feedback System (MFS) are the foundational 
practices that affect other practices like Employee Involvement and Empowerment (EIE), Team Building (TB), and 
Continuous Improvement Culture (CIC). From the ISM model, it can also be concluded that Hiring Practices (HP) 
have minimal impact on the implementation of TQM in an organization. Finally, this study concludes that strategically 
adopted human resource management practices contribute to the successful implementation of TQM in an 
organization.

1. Introduction
Today’s cutthroat competitive market requires the adoption of a business excellence philosophy like TQM that should 
be capable of handling the Quality (Q), Cost (C), and delivery (D) as per the customer requirement. In the process of 
implementation of TQM in an organization Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) plays a pivotal role. 
SHRM involves certain practices that are essential for building the culture that eases the adoption of TQM in an 
organization easily. Strategic HRM is an approach that defines how the organization's goals will be achieved through 
people using HR strategies and integrated HR policies and practices. It involves aligning human resource practices 
with the overall strategic goals of an organization (Fransisca1 and Komarudin, 2023). The implementation of TQM in

employees. In the MICMAC analysis both these factors are placed in quadrant -III which belongs to linkage variables. 
These types of variables are strong driving and dependence power and thus are responsible for holding together the 
other constructs of the model. Level 3 of the ISM is occupied by variables like Team Building (TB), Quality Circle 
(QC), and Continuous Improvement Culture (CIC). In the MICMAC analysis, these factors occupy quadrant -II which 
is dedicated to dependent variables. From the literature, it has been found that employee training and development 
(ETD) and employee involvement and empowerment (EIE) promote a culture of teamwork and continuous 
improvement. The formation of a quality circle provides an opportunity for the employee to work in groups for the 
resolution of problems that require cross-functional expertise. In this analysis, Hiring Practices (HP) occupied level 
IV in the ISM model, and MICMAC analysis this factor is placed in quadrant-II with a driving power of 1 and a 
dependence power of 6. In this work it is found that the hiring practices have a minimal impact on the implementation 
of TQM in an organization as compared to other factors, as per the discussions with the experts, it was observed that 
the hiring practices can ascertain only technical fit qualities of an individual, not the cultural fit qualities. Also, the 
organizational culture plays a moderating role in developing and empowering the employees. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Implementation of TQM in an organization requires company-wide efforts and strategic human resource management 
presents a structured approach to handling one of the most versatile resources i.e. human. This paper outlines the 
practices of SHRM essential for the implementation of TQM. The paper highlights that the vision of the top 
management towards employee participation, morale, empowerment, and satisfaction plays a pivotal role in the 
carrying out the practices in these areas and this will boost a team culture giving rise to a continuous improvement 
culture. The practices of building quality circles will help in creating awareness about quality and provide a platform 
for improving and sharing skills. In this paper, it is found the hiring practices adopted by an organization have 
minimum impact on the implementation of TQM.  
  
7. Practical and Managerial Implications 
This case study enlists broad practices that organizations and managers can choose and improvise to carry out the 
required SHRM practices for the implementation of TQM in the organization. 
 
8. Limitations and future scope of the work 
The ISM model presented in this paper is theoretically formulated and thus requires validation using tools like 
structural equation modeling.  
 
9. Conflict of Interest 
The authors report no significant conflict of interest in the development of the model.

Abstract 
The concept of stakeholder satisfaction in successfully implementing projects was developed as part of the project 
management success factors because municipal projects encompass different initiatives such as infrastructure 
development and community programmes tied to different stakeholders' interests. These stakeholders can be residents, 
government agencies, embassies, institutions of higher learning, and other entities impacted by or have a particular 
interest in the project. Municipalities need to ensure stakeholder satisfaction because municipal projects aim to 
improve the lives of the communities and ensure that quality service delivery reaches all that need those services. In 
this study, at the 5% level of significance, the following 8 of the 24 two-by-two associations were significant which 
are project completed within budgeted cost; project completed within a specified timeframe; project achieving all 
planned deliverables; stakeholder satisfaction; contribution to where the project is being implemented; geographical 
area's development; loss of grants and sub-standard infrastructure. Furthermore, from the eight (8) two-by-two 
associations, four (4) significant two-by-two associations between the degree of project performance being influential 
and ineffective. These four (4) factors were: completion of projects within budgeted cost, completion of projects within 
a specific timeframe, projects achieving all planned deliverables, stakeholder satisfaction, and determination of project 
success by measuring project outcomes. These factors were statistically significant at P<0.000, which showed an 
association between the two variables.

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, stakeholder satisfaction plays a critical role in the successful implementation of municipal projects 
because it enhances communication and collaboration. This research was conducted in one of the municipalities in 
South Africa, and it is intended to assess the importance of stakeholder satisfaction in successfully implementing 
municipal projects. The importance of this research emanates from the notion that projects in local government are 
perceived to be challenging and sometimes face backlash from stakeholders or end users of the project (Amoatey & 
Hayibor, 2017). Literature was assimilated to understand the role of stakeholders in implementing municipal projects 
and how organisations are supposed to engage and manage stakeholders effectively. In this research, stakeholders 
were defined as anyone who has a vested interest in the outcome of the project (Heagney, 2016).  
 
Data was collected by using a survey questionnaire to identify and evaluate factors that are perceived to affect 
stakeholder satisfaction in municipal projects. 151 respondents who took part in the study were asked to provide 
answers to 24 questions that were related to factors that affect stakeholder satisfaction in the implementation of 
municipal projects. These factors were measured by assessing the perceptions of the municipality project population 
(their personal experience/views) on the factors that affect stakeholder satisfaction in implementing municipal 
projects. The factors were clustered as follows: Project success factors and the factors affecting stakeholders in 
implementing municipal projects. The research found that 8 of the 24 P-values are smaller than 0.05. As such, it can 
be concluded that 8 of the 24 factors shown in the table are significantly associated with factors that affect stakeholder 
satisfaction in implementing municipal projects at the 5% significance level. 
 
There is a need for enhancing monitoring to ensure that internal controls are adhered to, project risks are managed, 
and project deliverables are achieved. It is essential that municipal officials responsible for monitoring understand 
their roles, are equipped to perform their functions, are provided with the authority their role requires, and that the 
outcomes of monitoring and oversight are appropriately responded to. Implementing capital project milestones should 
be integrated with the capital budget, operating expenditure, reporting, and auditing. Quarterly progress reports should 
be provided to all relevant stakeholders, and municipal leadership should effectively communicate and provide 
feedback to stakeholders.

Abstract 
This paper analyses the factors responsible for the failure of municipal projects because municipal projects play an 
essential role in shaping basic service delivery needs and infrastructure requirements for communities that reside in 
those municipal areas. As much as municipal projects are crucial, many South African municipalities encounter 
failure, leading to compromised service delivery, resource wastage, and deteriorating or lack of infrastructure. This 
paper delves into several factors responsible for the failure of municipal projects, assimilating insights from academic 
literature and exploring responses from respondents' perceptions. Data was collected from 151 respondents using a 
questionnaire adapted from a similar study. The respondents who took part in the study were employees and service 
providers/ contractors working in the project management environment. The study identified the top 10 factors out of 
the 29 factors that are responsible for the failure of municipal projects, namely poor plans and planning process, 
inadequate monitoring, selection of inexperienced project managers, inadequate human resources, lack of 
communication, poor leadership at all levels; lack of supervision; political interference; high level of corruption; 
change in government and inadequate capacity building of project managers. Over and above project management 
theory, this study contributes to the broader management literature. This study also suggests possible tools for 
successfully improving municipal projects.

Furthermore, of 151 respondents, 104 (68.87%) agree or strongly agree that misalignment between the project team 
and organisational goals influences failure to complete municipal projects successfully. Additionally, 109 out of 151 
(72.19%) respondents agree or strongly agree that a lack of project management techniques influences project failure. 
In comparison, 100 out of 151 (66.23%) respondents agree or strongly agree that incorrect definitions of specifications 
influence project failure. Not following procurement processes significantly contributed to the failure of municipal 
projects, with 101 out of 151 respondents (66.89%) agreeing or strongly agreeing. Furthermore, 104 out of 151 
respondents (68.87%) identified delays in releasing funds as a factor influencing project failure. Additionally, 
inadequate project funding was recognised by 102 out of 151 respondents (67.55%) as a critical factor contributing to 
project failure. 
 
Inadequate human resources were also identified as an influencer for failure in the successful completion of municipal 
projects, with 115 out of 151 (76.16%) respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing; lack of communication with 117 
out of 151 (77.48%) respondents agreeing or strongly agree, also poor leadership at any or all levels with 118 out of 
151 (78.15%) respondents who agree or strongly agree that same influences failure in the successful completion of 
projects. 
 
Eleven (11) 51 (72.85%) respondents agree or strongly agree that lack of supervision influences failure in completing 
municipal projects. In comparison, 133 out of 151 (88.08%) respondents agree or strongly agree that political 
interference influences failure in the successful completion of projects, 123 out of 151 (81.46%) respondents agree or 
strongly agree that a high level of corruption influences failure in the successful completion of projects; additionally, 
106 out of 151 (70.20%) respondents agree or strongly agree that the factor of not following regulations influences 
failure in the successful completion of projects. 
 
Scope change was identified as an influencer for failure in the successful completion of municipal projects, with 106 
out of 151 (70.20%) respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing. Not having a formal change of scope control system 
indicated that 109 out of 151 (72.19%) respondents agree or strongly agree that it influences failure in the successful 
completion of projects. In contrast, change in government has been identified by 110 out of 151 (72.85%) respondents 
who agree or strongly agree that it influences failure in the successful completion of projects and 125 out of 151 (82.78 
%) respondents who agree or strongly agree that inadequate capacity building of project managers failure in the 
successful completion of projects. 
 
On the other hand, 53.64% of respondents either agree or strongly agree that the project performance and selection of 
inexperienced project managers is inadequate, whereas 54.97% of respondents agree or strongly agree that project 
performance and inadequate human resources are ineffective. It can also be seen that 56.29% of the respondents agree 
or strongly agree that project performance and infrastructure development are inefficient. 
  
This study's results align with the findings of Adebisi, Ojo, and Alao (2018, p. 221); Aranyossy et al. (2018, pp. 21-
22); Damoah. et al. (2018, pp. 570-574) and Redafi (2017) suggested that the factors influencing project failure include 
poor plans and planning processes, inadequate monitoring, selection of inexperienced project managers, misalignment 
between the project team and organisational, lack of project management techniques, incorrect definition of 
specification, not following procurement processes, delays in releasing funds; inadequate project funding; inadequate 
human resources; lack of communication; poor leadership at any or all levels; lack of supervision; high level of 
corruption; scope change; not having formal change of scope control system; change in government and inadequate 
capacity building of project managers. 
 
6. Conclusion  
According to Ika and Saint-Macary (2014), project management in South Africa is moving in the right direction, 
meaning that project performance is improving regarding project management processes and organisational outcomes. 
However, project failure can happen for various reasons, and this study has identified the top 10 factors out of the 29. 
The municipality can start addressing these ten factors to improve or achieve a project success rate. The top 10 factors 
contributing to municipal project failure include political interference, ranked first; inadequate capacity building of 
project managers, ranked second; and high corruption, ranked third. Poor plans, planning processes, and inadequate 
monitoring were ranked fourth and fifth, respectively; poor leadership at any or all levels was 6th, and lack of communication 
was ranked seventh. Inadequate human resources was ranked 8th, inexperienced project managers' selection was ranked 
ninth, and lack of supervision and change in government were ranked 10th.

South African municipalities should explore the use of social capital to assist in achieving project success and 
collaborate towards improving the lives of the communities they serve. According to (Ilorah, 2014), social capital is 
a multi-disciplinary process that improves collaboration, access to financial capital, sustainable human resources, and 
political influence and can be crucial in influencing significant changes and attitudes, reducing inequality, accelerating 
economic growth, and improving project performance. As alluded to by Redafi (2017) and Abrantes and Figueiredo 
(2015), organisations that fail to manage projects equally fail to manage employees, and having employees who are 
demotivated can muddle even the best project plan. Project managers and organisations can use social capital to 
harness the project implementation throughout the life cycle.

Abstract 
To analyses the kinetic study of mineralization during electro-oxidation on Ti/DSA (Ta2O5-Ir2O5) and combined 
electro-oxidation and electro-coagulation on Stainless Steel (SS) anode of an anti-epileptic drug Lamotrigine 
(LAM) in synthetic wastewater over a specific charge.  Four different reaction orders (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2) were 
tested using the integral method of analysis by plotting concentration terms over specific charges to determine 
the exact rate kinetics for the mineralization. The effect of applied current density was evaluated at 50 ppm of 
sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) as supporting electrolyte, and the effect of supporting electrolyte concentration was 
also assessed at a current density of 1.38 mA/cm2 in 50 ppm LAM solution. As a result of (i) electro-oxidation 
experiments on LAM, carried out on Ti/DSA anode, and (ii) combined electro-oxidation and electro-coagulation 
experiments carried out on SS anode, based on the R-squared value of the mineralization curves, the first-order 
reaction rate was proposed.

1. Introduction
Lamotrigine (LAM) is a new generation classified antiepileptic drug used for managing refractory partial 
seizures in patients with or without secondary generalization (Bashiz and Sayyaf 2020; Behbahania et al. 2020) . 
It has been increasingly used as monotherapy in the management of tonic-clonic seizures (Behbahania et al. 
2020; Chefetz et al. 2019). A recent study confirmed the presence of LAM in 94% of samples of which is 
strongly affected by wastewater at an average concentration of 488 ng/L (Chew et al. 2009). In another study, 
the presence of LAM is reported at concentrations of ng/L in treated wastewater and wastewater contaminated 
freshwater (Denga et al. 2018). LAM is having neuroactive properties that make it potentially hazardous to 
aquatic life similar to other pharmaceuticals of psychoactive nature (Ferrer and Thurman 2010). The harmful 
effects of LAM are; fever, headache, fatigue and diarrhoea (Foster et al. 2010; Ghatak 2014&2020; Hanawa et 
al. 2018). whilst the overdose can cause life-threatening skin rashes (Hultberg et al. 2020; Jeong and Lee 2012). 
Various processes conventional processes, direct photolysis and ozonation are used for the removal of LAM 
from wastewater but they are found less efficient with poor recoveries and high energy consumption (Keen et al. 
2012; Li et al. 2016; Morawska et al. 2020). Therefore, for complete mineralization of LAM from wastewater, 
an efficient and eco-friendly method is to be implemented. 
To the best of our knowledge and based on the literature, no previous work reported on the kinetic study on 
LAM mineralization over specific charge during electro-oxidation experiments carried out on Ti/DSA anode 
and combined electro-oxidation and electro-coagulation experiments carried out on SS anode.

4 Conclusions 
In the present experimental investigation, the kinetic study of mineralization of anti-epileptic drug LAM in synthetic 
wastewater was studied by electro-oxidation and Combined electro-oxidation and electro-coagulation on Ti/DSA 
(Ta2O5-Ir2O5) and SS anode, respectively, in a batch operation. The effect of applied current density was evaluated 
at 50 ppm of sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) as supporting electrolyte, and the effect of supporting electrolyte 
concentration was also evaluated at a current density of 01.38 mA/cm2 in 50 ppm LAM solution. Four different 
reaction orders (0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2) are tested by using the integral method of analysis by plotting concentration term 
over specific charge to find out the exact rate kinetics for the mineralization of LAM on SS anode, 
The electrochemical mineralization of LAM depended on the anode type. For mineralization of LAM for both 
Ti/DSA (Ta2O5-Ir2O5) and SS anode, High values of R-squared were obtained for mineralization curves of LAM for 
both Ti/DSA(Ta2O5-Ir2O5) and SS anode, confirmed for pseudo-first-order kinetics for mineralization of LAM on 
both the anodes.

Abstract 
This paper introduces a streamlined sugarcane supply chain network (SSCN) aimed at efficiently managing the 
substantial by-products of the sugar industry, with the primary objective of seamlessly reintegrating them into the 
supply chain with minimal alterations. The effective management of these by-products is crucial for minimizing 
overall operational costs. To tackle the inherent complexity of supply chain challenges, commonly utilized meta-
heuristic techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO). Validation of the proposed 
approach is carried out through a real-world case study, while hypothetical test scenarios are utilized to further 
underscore its reliability. The results highlight a promising balance between solution effectiveness and computational 
efficiency, underscoring the viability of the approach.

1. Introduction
Supply chain is the effective management of goods from producers to the consumers. Managing the effective flow of 
these goods constitutes the supply chain management that helps in making money and the acceptance of the product 
by the consumers measures the success rate. The major capital of any firm is invested on the supply chain so the 
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) designs their supply chain in such a manner that it can compete effectively 
in the market with the other competitors see (Hajiaghaei-Keshteli, Mostafa, and Amir Mohammad, 2018). The supply 
chain is nothing but the effective management of goods from source to destination without compromising the need of 
the consumers. In contrary to this, the Reverse Logistic (RL) helps in collecting those parts or products and bringing 
back to the initial chain after its use. Recovering this reclaimable parts help in cut down the total production cost to 
some extent. Jayaraman et al. (1999) focused on collecting the cores for reverse logistics considering the case of 
demand uncertainty. Brito and Dekker et al. (2004) presented a study on the reverse logistics stating that what type of 
products are flowing back and how they can be recovered and who is executing and managing the various operations. 
Many government legislations are actively focusing on varies countries where during the design of a product itself 
manufacturers are responsible for the disposal of product after use Soo et al. (2018) and Cremiato et al. (2018)

6. Conclusion 
In this paper, a novel closed-loop supply chain problem for sugarcane is modeled. The objective is to minimize the 
total network costs. We considered all main specifications of sugarcane those influence in designing its supply chain 
both in forward and backwards phase along with its cost. The proposed model can be solved by using heuristics and 
meta-heuristics with different approaches for real word scale. The supply chain model can also be designed to have 
multiple fuzzy-objective and other techniques can be developed to solve the proposed model. Proposed model in 
similar fields of fresh fruits and food can be utilized for the future studies. 
 
The issue of significant by-products generated by sugarcane refineries presents an intriguing challenge. This study has 
raised numerous questions that warrant further investigation, offering potential avenues for future research. There are 
several opportunities for future work, such as enhancing and redesigning the model to accommodate assumptions and 
constraints from other countries. Additionally, the current model could be expanded to address multiple objectives, 
incorporating sustainability considerations. Implementing combined or hybrid techniques could lead to more accurate 
optimal solutions within shorter computational timeframes. Moreover, future research could explore the development 
of supply chain networks for other food or agricultural-based products, which have yet to be studied comprehensively.

Abstract 
This is a study on the assembly processes of wooden stands of the company 2M Stands. The main objective is to 
reduce both the costs and the total duration of setting up stands at fairs and events. Firstly, using a SWOT analysis, it 
was understood, in partnership with the company 2M Stands, the current situation regarding internal processes and 
how the fairs and events market is moving towards sustainable solutions, which reflect a competitive advantage in the 
product. Once this process was understood, the validation of the components was carried out, which within the 
assembly of wooden stands, had the potential to be standardized. All unit cost data of these components were collected, 
as well as the number of times they were used per project, over the period from September 2022 to September 2023. 
Based on the Pareto Analysis, it was possible to conclude that in addition to the potential financial gains, it is also 
possible to achieve a more uniform distribution of its resources, reducing the effects of market seasonality. Finally, it 
is highlighted that Lean mentality was applied, reflecting a continuous and comprehensive approach in decision-
making aimed at the lean production system.

5. Conclusions 
Throughout this study, it was possible to achieve results consistent with the reality of the company, which were 
recognized and praised by the CEO. Furthermore, for the standardization of furniture, quantitative results were 
presented for the implementation of the model. However, for the construction of these units, the outsourcing model 
was chosen, with the inclusion of valuable ideas such as the use of solid planning software, aimed at increasing 
productivity and reducing production costs. Additionally, the company demonstrated awareness by analyzing the size 
of the sheets to establish standard measurements for the furniture. 
Finally, it is suggested that the construction of these furniture pieces follow a triennial standardization. This calculation 
is based on wood wear due to excessive use, furniture breakage due to carelessness in transportation, and 
contamination of some pieces by termites, which end up rendering the entire inventory useless at the end of the three-
year period. 
This study contributed to the company adopting the replacement of existing structures with modular models, which 
generated extraordinary results. The projection indicated a 61% reduction in total construction and assembly costs, 
along with a significant 44% decrease in the effort required for these activities over a one-year period. Thus, the 
research purpose was successfully achieved, suggesting solutions that can bring a significant impact on the operational 
optimization of the investigated company. This research not only expanded knowledge on the subject but also stood 
out as a relevant contribution to the field, opening doors for future investigations and practical improvements in the 
field of modular structures. Finally, it is recommended that the company apply PDCA (cycle for continuous 
improvement: Plan, Do Check and Act) and SDCA (cycle for maintaining results: Standardize, Do, Check, Act) in its 
processes for the implementation of the suggested improvements.

Abstract 
Virtual reality (VR) can generate imaginative, interactive, and immersive worlds, emerging as a novel gateway for the 
next generation of computing platforms. Nevertheless, the human factors and ergonomics (HFE) challenges associated 
with VR headsets pose risks to the user's physical and mental well-being and limit the widespread application of VR 
across various domains. In addition, research remains scarce on the optimal design of user interfaces (UI) in VR to 
ensure positive user experiences (UX). This paper offers a comprehensive overview of studies in the realm of HFE 
concerning virtual reality headsets, i.e., head-mounted displays (HMDs). This review paper explores and discusses 
HFE issues related to VR user interfaces (UI) and provides guidelines to enhance human-centered product 
development. It is important to note that these guidelines are regarded merely as a starting point for future research, 
as they necessitate validation.

1. Introduction
Virtual Reality (VR) is a three-dimensional virtual environment generated through computer simulation, providing 
realistic sensations, including touch, auditory experiences, and vision. The users engage with elements in the digital 
environment through essential equipment, creating an immersive experience. As productivity advances and 
technology progresses, there is a growing and robust demand for VR technology across various industries, including 
construction, aviation, healthcare, and automobile. In recent years, VR has been recognized as a key technological 
trend driving the digitization of various facets of human life (Chellappa et al., 2022).

4.3.3 Texture Gradient  
Contradictory texture gradients have the potential to induce increased visual fatigue. Texture gradients serve as cues 
that convey information about objects' depth and spatial orientation within a scene. Inconsistent information from 
these cues may disrupt stereopsis, the perception of depth and three-dimensionality (Lambooij and IJsselsteijn, 2009; 
Su et al., 2018). Excessively sharp textures, particularly when intended to depict objects at a distance from the user, 
may be perceived as ‘unnatural’ depth cues (Yuan et al., 2018). When textures serve as crucial depth cues, ensure the 
replication of gradients closely resembling real visual perception to provide accurate orientation information (Leroy, 
2016).  
 
4.3.4 Occlusion  
When one object obscures a portion of another, it gives the impression of being ‘closer’ to the viewer. If the object 
meant to be positioned behind has additional depth cues that suggest closeness, it may impact visual fatigue 
(Pietroszek, 2015). These cues introduce ambiguity. In the case of stereoscopy presentation, as the Field of View 
(FoV) in HMDs is restricted, objects with negative parallax could be partially obscured due to this limited 
FoV.  Ensure clarity in occlusion by avoiding ambiguity. Decreasing the quantity of 3D objects can be beneficial. 
Minimizing the overlap of objects is particularly helpful (Sidenmark et al., 2020), especially in scenarios where the 
intention is to reach out and touch an object (Yu et al., 2021). Additionally, it confirms that objects with stereoscopic 
cues are predominantly positioned within the central vision.  
 
4.3.5 Blur  
Blur can influence both vergence and accommodation, as suggested by studies (Sweeney et al., 2014). Consequently, 
introducing blur to objects in areas where the visual system is expected to depend on vergence and accommodation 
cues may increase symptoms. Please exercise caution when applying blur to images, ensuring that it is not applied to 
objects of interest but to other elements in the scene. This approach helps prevent unintended shifts in accommodation.  
 
4.3.6 Color  
Increased frequency of color changes is associated with higher levels of visual fatigue, as observed in studies (Kim et 
al., 2016). The color temperature appears to impact visual fatigue (Wang et al., 2020). Additionally, stereoscopic 
acuity has risen with improved color discrimination ability (Koctekin et al., 2020). Moreover, there is a correlation 
between color and luminance. Steer clear of colors with frequent and drastic changes. Refrain from using highly 
saturated colors, as recommended in studies (Kim et al., 2016). Opt for colors with low luminance to mitigate the risk 
of visual fatigue.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper summarized the HFE issues in VR-based UI. Drawing from the review, the following are the significant 
guidelines that could be followed to enhance the UX:  
• 
Design interfaces that adapt to users' preferences and behavior over time.  
• 
Pay careful attention to HFE considerations to ensure user comfort during extended usage.  
• 
Optimizing visual elements and interaction mechanics can minimize the potential for discomfort, motion 
sickness, or eye strain. 
• 
Provide users with customization options for the interface, allowing them to personalize their virtual 
experience. This could include adjustable settings for controls, visuals, and interaction styles to cater to 
individual preferences. 
• 
Implement accessibility features to accommodate users with different needs. Consider factors such as font 
size, color contrast, and alternative input methods to make the VR experience inclusive.

Abstract 
Social, institutional and business interest in sustainability has grown in the last decades. New regulations, 
technological progress, social awareness about environmental issues and irregular working conditions are key factors 
affecting the way organisations plan and measure relevant strategies. Sustainability strategies can play a key role in 
driving innovation through learning, motivation, attraction and retention of skillful employees. The aim of this paper 
is to analyse the causal interrelations between deployment of effective sustainability strategies, employee motivation 
and the financial performance perspective. A Systems Thinking approach is applied through Causal Loop Diagrams 
to analyse key factors and the nature of their interrelationships influencing the dynamic behaviour of this complex 
system. This analysis also considers the Ability, Motivation and Opportunity (AMO) framework to explain the 
complexity of employee behaviour, motivation and impact on strategic performance. This research confirmed that a 
supportive relation can be established between the implementation of effective sustainability strategies, represented 
by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Human Resources (HR) initiatives, and the financial performance of a 
business organisations. The study focused on private business organisations in the UK and USA, which encourages 
future broad studies. This research provides relevant insights to understand better the complexity of the relationships 
between sustainability strategies, employee motivation and business performance.

Abstract 
In 2021, the commerce sector in Brazil emerged as the primary source of job creation, responsible for around 26% of 
jobs in the country. However, the restrictions adopted to combat the COVID-19 pandemic affected the retail trade 
during 2020, resulting in a 1.4% reduction in sales volume compared to revenue levels seen in 2013. This paper 
analyzes and forecasts the monthly nominal revenue index for the retail sector of household appliances using the Holt-
Winters, Sarima, Keras, Facebook's Prophet, and Random Forest models. The index presents a seasonal behavior that 
repeats every year, with  higher revenue values in the last quarter of each year, period marked by major sales 
promotions and festive occasions. The time series is model during the pre-pandemic period and during the pandemic 
period. The Holt-Winters model with multiplicative seasonal and additive trend components demonstrated the best 
performance using the MSE and MAPE criteria with a mean absolute percentage error of predictions of 3.95. Finally, 
it was observed that considering the index observed during the pandemic period in model training led to greater 
accuracy in predictions.

1. Introduction
Retail trade is an important pillar of the Brazilian economy, making a substantial contribution to the Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) of the country and employment generation, owing to its strategic position in product and service 
distribution and its proximity to end consumers. According to the Brazilian Retail and Consumer Society (Papel do 
Varejo na Economia Brasileira 2021), the commerce sector, which includes both retail and wholesale, accounted for 
about 26% of jobs in Brazil in 2021, establishing itself as the primary source of job creation in the country, with a 
workforce of approximately 8.5 million workers. In 2022, Brazilian retail generated revenues of 1.05 trillion Brazilian 
reais, representing a growth of 14.1% compared to the previous year.  
The electronics sector, which includes the sale of devices with integrated circuit boards, stood out with a growth of 
4.0% and revenues of R$ 220.4 billion (Papel do Varejo na Economia Brasileira 2023). However, according to 
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the actions taken by the Brazilian government to combat the 
Covid-19 pandemic directly impacted the retail trade in 2020, with sales volume declined by 1.4%, returning to 
revenue levels seen in 2013 (Pesquisa Mensal do Comércio - PMC 2021). On the other hand, the electronics sector 
experienced a growth of 13.2% in the same year due to increased demand for electronic products driven by the rise in 
remote activities (Comportamento da Indústria Elétrica e Eletrônica em 2022 2023). 
The use of machine learning prediction models becomes essential in planning sales and marketing strategies based on 
historical data and the current market positioning, especially during exceptional periods. During the pandemic period, 
restrictions affected the supply chain, reduced overall demand, and led to increased inventory levels, making it difficult

It is worth mentioning that when considering the index observed during the pandemic period in model training, the 
prediction values for 2023 follow the index's behavior with less variability, Figure 4, compared to the prediction values 
of models that omitted the observed values during the pandemic period in their algorithm training, Figure 5.

5. Conclusion 
Forecasting models play a crucial role in supporting managerial decisions and planning activities. By leveraging 
historical data and employing intelligent computer systems, companies can generate valuable insights into future 
product demands. This information is vital for optimizing inventory levels, production schedules, and resource 
allocation. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, these models effectively predicted future trends, empowering retail 
companies to plan effective strategies based on reliable forecasts. However, during the pandemic, none of the models 
were able to predict reliable values, but the Machine Learning models have lower errors. In scenarios involving long-
term predictions, Machine Learning models outperformed traditional statistical models when trained with data that 
included the pandemic period, showcasing superior adaptability to outlier values. Conversely, when the pandemic 
period was excluded from the training data, the Holt-Winters model exhibited the best performance in predicting long-
term values. 
 
It's still crucial to refine a model that can swiftly adapt to future outliers, such as the data from the Covid-19 period. 
None of the tested models, in this paper, have managed this effectively. By doing so, the market's resilience to future 
crises will be enhanced, enabling the formulation of better strategies for navigating such periods. If the models were 
able to adapt for external information, as the investment made by the Brazilian government to support the pandemic, 
the retail sector would has a predict view to help the decision and strategies in that moment, because, with the current

Abstract 
Nowadays, environmental and social sustainability issues besides the increment in the customers’ awareness regarding 
global warming are pushing companies toward more sustainable business models. Accordingly, the Subscription-
Based Business Model (SBBM) is grabbing more attention from both business owners and consumers as it has the 
potential to enhance business sustainability performance by implementing Circular Economy (CE) practices such as 
reducing, reusing, and recycling. Besides, some studies show that SBBMs are more resilient during disruptions such 
as the pandemic. Moreover, SBBM offers additional after-sale services to the customers at a more reasonable price 
and brings constant revenue streams for the companies through subscription fees. However, conducting CE initiatives 
for SBBMs causes more complexities in the operations of the companies due to increasing reverse logistics activities 
and requiring repair and recycling operations to increase product lifetime and close the supply chain loop. To 
overcome these challenges, new technologies like blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) facilitate data collection 
and analysis along the whole value chain and improves the decision-making procedures for business owners. 
Accordingly, this study focuses on different parameters and decision conditions that subscription firms should 
consider in their analysis to compare the impact of implementing CE practices on the operational cost and their 
sustainability performance with the traditional business models. Moreover, we provide the optimal solutions for the 
service capacity to maximize the profit concerning CE practices. The outputs indicate the importance of managing 
inventory and ordering policies, repair and maintenance costs, and efficient recycling plans to achieve a profitable 
model. Furthermore, we discuss the conditions that the SBBM outweighs traditional models in terms of improving 
reducing, reusing, and recycling indicators.

Abstract 
In this work, we examine the cost effectiveness of routing traffic on service networks under random failures. Given a 
service network, that is subject to random link failures, we analyze the worst-case performance of the network in terms 
of the total cost incurred in routing the traffic to satisfy all the node pair demand requirements. Given 𝑏𝑏∈ ℕ, we 
primarily focus on network failure scenarios, where 𝑏𝑏-simultaneous links are non-functional. It is important to note 
that computing the worst-case routing cost over a set of link failure scenarios is classified as an NP-Hard problem 
(Hochba 1997). We propose an approach that leverages recent developments in robust optimization, integer, and linear 
programming to construct convex relaxation of the original NP-Hard problem. Our approach exploits the intrinsic 
binary nature of the link functionality (i.e., links are either functional or dead), to construct the convex relaxations, 
that provide quick and strong upper bounds for the original intractable worst case routing cost problem. To substantiate 
our findings, we also provide computational results on real life service network topologies.

1. Introduction
In the era of digital transformation, where the economy hinges ever more on service networks for essential functions, 
the design and optimization of these networks have become increasingly crucial for meeting the growing demands of 
the modern society. Service networks, encompassing telecommunications, transportation, supply chains, and more, 
serve as the backbone of global connectivity and economic activity. Ensuring the reliability of these networks has 
become paramount (Hong et al. 2018, Almaktoom et al. 2016, Yildiz et al. 2016, Khourshed et al. 2024). Service 
networks, owing to their constant evolution and global reach, are plagued by frequent failures, see for reference (Ahuja 
et al. 2018, Potharaju et al. 2013, Govindan et al. 2016, Chandra and Tawarmalani 2022). Thus, the design of such 
networks is fraught with uncertainties, including fluctuating demand patterns, evolving technology landscapes, and 
unforeseen disruptions (Yadav et al. 2018, Taha et al. 2015, Shahmoradi-Moghadama et al. 2021). One of the critical 
challenges in designing a service network is to efficiently route traffic through the network, ensuring full demand 
satisfaction and keeping in mind various factors such as cost efficiency, congestion, and dynamic demand patterns. 
Each of these service networks are deigned to perform a critical task, and with network failures becoming a new norm, 
there is a pressing need to ensure that the service networks perform their assigned tasks in a cost-efficient manner 
across all the potential failures. Cost validation plays a pivotal role in the design phase of service networks, as it entails 
assessing the economic feasibility and efficiency of proposed network configurations (Kaur et al. 2017, Bar-Noy et 
al. 1990, Bottani et al. 2010, Habib et al. 2022). Cost validation in service networks under random failures refers to 
the process of ensuring that the estimated costs related to service network operations are accurate and reliable, even 
when the network faces unforeseen disruptions. Effective cost validation helps in mitigating financial risks, optimizing

respectively. In Table 4, we also note that the service networks X* and C* cannot fulfill the demand required when 
the number of link failures are three or more, hence the optimal routing cost is unbounded. We represent this as ** in 
Columns labeled “A1”, “A2”, and “A3”.

From Table 4, as expected approaches “A1” and “A2” obtain the same optimal routing cost. This optimal routing cost 
is the ground truth value. The enumeration approach A1, though requires more CPU run-time than solving the single 
stage formulation described as in M1. This is also understandable as the list of failure scenarios to be enumerated 
increases exponentially with increasing size of the service network (more edges in the network). The optimal routing 
cost values obtained by solving the RLT relaxation of M1, i.e., via approach A3 are exact when the number of link 
failures is one. However, for higher values of 𝑏𝑏, this approach provides a valid upper bound on the optimal routing 
cost. We further observe that the CPU run-times for obtaining the optimal value via approach A3 is smallest of the 
three approaches. Hence for a general value of 𝑏𝑏, solving the linear program obtained as the RLT relaxation of M1, 
provides a quick way to compute a valid upper bound for the optimal routing cost for a service network. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper we have addressed the problem of cost validation in designing service networks, where given an 
uncertainty set, in particular a set of all 𝑏𝑏-simultaneous link failure scenarios, the goal is to quantify the worst-case 
routing cost for a routing scheme that ensures all source-destination demand requirements are fulfilled. This problem 
is a hard problem, and we aim to propose an approach which can quickly provide a valid upper bound on this worst-
case routing cost. The approach we propose, uses ideas from mixed integer nonlinear optimization and constructs a 
convex relaxation of the original problem which can be solved in an efficient manner. Our computation results on real 
service networks are encouraging. We observe that for single link failure scenarios the proposed approach is exact to 
the optimal routing cost, however for higher number of link failures, the approach gives useful and quick bounds on 
the optimal coast. We believe that this approach can help design more reliable and cost-efficient routing schemes for 
the service networks.

Abstract 
There are recent calls for research into understanding how manufacturing operations in Ghana can be improved, make 
them competitive and also increase the sector’s contribution to the economy. Against this background, this study 
explored the relationships between supply chain strategies, competitive priorities and organizational performance in the 
context of manufacturing operations in Ghana. To achieve the research objectives, a structured questionnaire was used 
to collect data from 230 manufacturing firms. The data collected was analyzed quantitively through Structural Equation 
Modelling (SEM), to establish the anticipated relationships. The study revealed that, supply chain strategies measured 
by efficiency and responsiveness, positively influence competitive priorities (cost, quality, speed, flexibility and 
dependability) and organizational performance measure by revenue and market share. Efficiency as a supply chain 
strategy was found to impact more on market share than revenue. Also, competitive priorities positively influenced 
revenue than market share. Cost as a competitive priority positively influence revenue than market share.  However, 
Supply chain strategies had higher impact on revenue and market share than competitive priorities on revenue and 
market share. In view of this, the study recommends that Ghanaian manufacturing firms should adopt the efficient supply 
chain strategy and also Cost as a competitive priority to be able to improve their organizational performance and stay 
competitive.

1. Introduction
Effective supply chain management (SCM) has become an undoubtedly potential valuable way of obtaining competitive 
advantage and enhancing firm’s performance as competition is no more between firms, but between supply chains (Colin 
et al. 2015). Supply chain strategies centers on the progress and modification of entire process between organizations 
and plays a crucial role in expounding firms’ operating strategy (Qi et al. 2017). Competitive strategy aims to promote 
competitive advantage for a firm in an industry. Therefore, it refers to strategies that firms put in place to deal with 
competition in their market and emphasizes on realizing and sustaining a competitive advantage in the target industry 
(Taghipour et al. 2020). There are few variables that organizations set as their competitive priorities on which their 
strategies are designed. Some dimensions of competitive priorities are quality, cost-leadership, delivery, flexibility, 
differentiation dependability, innovation, time, service and manufacturing technologies (Bayraktar et al. 2017; Kathuria 
et al. 2010).

increase a firm’s revenue and market share. A limitation of the study is that it was restricted to manufacturing firms 
operating in Ghana. It would be insightful to investigate service firms in future research to ascertain whether the industry 
has a role to play in the selection of the SCS and competitive priorities and how these affects organizational performance 
and influence service firms’ competitiveness.

Abstract 
We are currently in the “Decade of Action” for achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Zero Hunger which 
underscores the urgency and commitment to addressing food insecurity by 2030. Compared to other parts of the world, 
food security issues in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) are severe due to water scarcity, conflict, and supply 
chain challenges. Given the land, weather limitations and other constraints of the region, adopting precision agriculture 
and smart farming enabled approaches is imperative to shorten the path to be traversed to achieve SDG objectives. In 
this paper, we bring together facts and figures relevant to MENA region and present a framework for adopting data-
driven digital transformation to achieve resilience in the food supply chain (FSC) of the region. The proposed 
framework enables action initiatives such as implementing advanced analytics-driven proactive strategies, achieving 
end-to-end real-time accessibility, and facilitating smart, transparent, and flexible control of overall food supply chain 
operations.

1. Introduction
This decade witnessed huge leapfrogging in technology, communication, infrastructure, and information handling, 
nevertheless, we lag so much behind in food security. As per the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the 
estimated number of undernourished people rose from 690 M in 2019 to 720 -811 M in 2020 and will surpass 840 M 
by 2030, equivalent to 9.8% of the global population. Around 6% of the world population is from the MENA region, 
however, in a global scenario, the region’s share of food-insecure people is 20%. Market access and distribution 
channels across the MENA region are unique and key bottlenecks in fresh food farming include, water scarcity, climate 
and environmental factors, and limited arable land. Hence, food supply chains rely on imports from other countries. 
The technological and infrastructural constraints including limited investment in agricultural technologies, irrigation 
systems, and infrastructure have negatively affected the efficiency and scalability of fresh food farming operations in 
some of the countries in the region. Lack of access to modern farming equipment and practices also affects productivity 
in some countries of the region.  
1.1 Objectives  
The main objectives of this research are as follows. 
RQ1: Evaluate digital technology adoption impact, including communication, innovation adoption (artificial 
intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT)) on the resilience of fresh food supply chains in the MENA region. 
From a supply chain perspective, technology adoption should translate to improvements in demand forecasting, 
inventory management, and supplier relations which directly influence the efficiency and profitability of food services.

6. Conclusion  
Data-driven digital agriculture can bring about a systematic transformation of the food supply chain allowing improved 
demand analysis, market access, optimized use of available resources, and efficient logistics. This is a much-needed 
change to answer emergency responses and be resilient. Hence, in this paper, we presented how digital transformation 
can be achieved to make a significant impact across various elements of the food supply chain.  Given the MENA 
region's limited agricultural resources, digital transformation of the food supply chain represents a viable solution to 
mitigate challenges. From a supply chain management perspective, such, streamlined inventory management, demand 
forecasting, and efficient supplier relations, can increase profitability considerably.   Distributor logistics including 
routing and delivery can be optimized based on factors like traffic conditions, delivery schedules, and customer 
preferences, reducing transportation costs and delivery times. Key technologies identified for this digital 
transformation of FSC are IoT, blockchain, robotics, unified communications, and AI.

Abstract 
Supply chain management mobile applications have been beneficial in managing real-time orders and tracking of 
goods, inventory control, and cost optimization. However, the exponential growth of supply chain mobile 
applications has made it difficult for users to select the optimal application to suit their supply chain needs. Existing 
mobile app rating tools such as the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) and Feature-based Application Rating Method 
were developed with a focus in the health sector and are also not designed to capture the subjective nature of 
responses for rating supply chain mobile apps. This study therefore developed the Fuzzy Mobile App Rating Scale 
(FMARS) for rating supply chain mobile apps. To accomplish this, the study first established the major factors 
deemed important to the performance of supply chain mobile applications and computed their relative importance 
weights using the fuzzy Pairwise Comparison method. The factors and their related importance weights were 
employed in a fuzzy TOPSIS framework to rank selected supply chain mobile apps from Apple Store and Google 
Play Store based on an established inclusion criteria. Findings suggest that the developed FMARS is remarkably 
practical for the ranking and selection of mobile apps, especially when rating data solicited is imprecise.

1. Introduction
The rapid growth of mobile phones worldwide makes mobile application one of the fastest-growing technologies 
(Raeesi et al., 2022). Mobile applications consist of software that run on a mobile device to perform certain tasks 
for the user. (Nochkin, 2013). Mobile apps presently perform more advanced functions other than the mere calling, 
messaging, audio and video and there has been so much progress that it now supports supply chain management. 
Supply chains are essential networks that enable the production and distribution of goods globally (Büyüközkan 
and Göçer, 2022). As supply chains grow more complex with globalization, mobile technology has emerged as an 
invaluable tool for managing logistics and enabling supply chain visibility (Sufiyan et al., 2019). The supply chain 
management mobile software market is projected to reach $15.5 billion by 2027, indicating the rising importance 
of mobility in streamlining supply chain operations (MnM, 2022). Implementing mobile applications can provide 
various advantages like real-time tracking, coordinating logistics, reducing costs and risks, and improving 
collaboration across supply chain stakeholders (Verma and Singh, 2022). However, challenges still exist regarding 
effective evaluation and selection of the most suitable mobile applications for supply chain needs. 
Supply Chain Management Mobile Apps (SCMMA) refers to the use of mobile apps and devices to facilitate supply 
chain operations, which helps businesses in cost reductions, supply chain responsiveness, and competitive advantage 
(Nysveen et al., 2015).  Examples of these apps are Logistimo Plus which enables users to manage supply chain in

5. Conclusion 
This study presented a fuzzy version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) for ranking supply chain 
mobile apps which have seen considerable growth in recent times. However, to be able to undertake such rankings 
required the establishment of the relevant criteria based on which competing supply chain mobile apps could be 
rated on. Upon an extensive literature search and building upon the criteria of MARS as proposed by Stuyanov et 
al (2017), five main criteria, namely Engagement, Functionality, Aesthetics, Information, and Security were agreed 
on by experts to be the most important. The sub-criteria under each of the main criteria were also established. The 
relative importance weights of the main and the sub-criteria were then determined using the fuzzy AHP method 
resulting in Functionality seen as the most important of the five main criteria, followed by Security, then Information 
and Engagement in a tie, and lastly Aesthetics as the least important among the five criteria. Similar rankings were 
done for all the sub-criteria of the main criteria. 
 
The established criteria and the importance weights were employed in a fuzzy TOPSIS method to evaluate the 
performance of six supply chain management mobile apps selected from Apple Store and Google Play Store 
resulting in the app Store Manager judged as the one with the best overall performance. 
 
The developed fuzzy MARS method by this paper is not only practical but also easy to use as it is built on well-
established techniques of AHP and TOPSIS.  
 
One of the most important contributions of this study is the establishment of the relevant criteria for evaluating 
supply chain mobile apps. As stated, these were arrived at after an extensive literature search and input from supply 
chain management experts. It must be acknowledged that the number of experts who ranked the criteria could have 
been increased and likewise the medium of selection of the supply chain mobile apps for ranking could have also 
been expanded, suggesting that it is likely that the importance weights and therefore the ranking of the criteria and 
the competing supply chain mobile apps could change.

Abstract 
It is no doubt that the use social media has gradually creeped into business operations in general and supply chain 
management in particular. However, the how and why of social media usage in supply chains and the associated value 
outcomes are yet to be understood from the literature. The purpose of this study was to explore the antecedents and 
value outcomes relating to the integration of social media into supply chain management. The study employed a 
qualitative research approach through a case study research design. Data was collected from 14 interview participants 
from two case organisations. Participants were dominantly logistics and supply chain management professionals. Data 
was analysed using the thematic interview analysis technique anchored on TOE framework and the Dynamic 
Capabilities View (DCV). The study established that technological, organisational, environmental and social factors 
influence the integration of social media in supply chain management. Social media integration into supply chain 
management enhances communication, stakeholder relations, and collaboration and promotes transparency, strategic 
decision-making and overall business performance. It was ascertained that there are little to no risks currently 
associated with their supply chain regarding adopting and integrating social media into supply chain operations in 
Ghana. However, the fear of the system being hacked in the future and vital information leaking is anticipated since 
customers and employees are on the same social media platform.

1. Introduction
Social media has been integrated into daily life and offers a virtual network where people and businesses can connect, 
exchange information, and conduct business anytime, anywhere (Chae et al. 2020; Siddiqui 2016). Social media 
allows communication between employees and the organisation’s stakeholders. It also promotes speed, visibility, and 
traceability inside companies and enables an organisation to build and engage in good customer relationships (Khatua 
et al. 2021; Ahmed et al. 2019; Lee et al. 2018).

Abstract 
The objective of this research is to analyze the process of elaboration of a product in a manufacturing company 
through the implementation of the Kaizen methodology. The activities that add value and the opportunity areas were 
identified through five kaizen improvement projects. Then, opportunity areas were analyzed and improved to meet 
customer demand on time. A work plan was defined for each stage of the project, using lean tools such as the 5 whys, 
takt time, line balancing, Kanban, application of the 5s and preparation of work instruction sheets. The results show 
a 60% increase in production at the assembly area. At the cable cutting station, the waiting time of 3 hours and 11 
minutes for the crimping station was eliminated and the roll change was reduced by 50% of the time. In addition, the 
project eliminated the waiting time of 2 hours and 42 minutes in the assembly, crimping, tinning and assembly areas 
of the harness sub-assembly process. The lead time was reduced by 50%, going from 7.2 days to 3.6 days, consisting 
of a 26% reduction in total cycle time. Finally, it is concluded that the implementation of kaizen managed to eliminate 
waiting time on the production line, reduced total cycle times and lead time, making the process smooth and 
increasing production capacity, so it is recommended to implement the Kaizen methodology throughout the 
manufacturing company.

5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this study has provided valuable insights into the profound impacts of inadequate Fourth Industrial 
Revolution (4IR) infrastructure on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in South Africa. Through a comprehensive 
examination of the prevailing conditions and challenges faced by academic institutions, we have elucidated the 
complexities of navigating the 4IR landscape in a resource-constrained environment. 
Our findings reveal that poor 4IR infrastructure, lack of co-curricular resources, inadequate internet connectivity, and 
outdated technologies are significant barriers hindering the seamless integration of 4IR technologies into academic 
620","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
 
curricula. These challenges not only impede academic excellence and innovation but also exacerbate disparities in 
access to educational opportunities, particularly among marginalized communities. 
The results of our exploratory factor analysis underscore the pervasive nature of infrastructure-related challenges, 
encapsulated within Factor 1 as the ""Impact of Inadequate 4IR Infrastructure."" This factor highlights the multifaceted 
deficiencies in infrastructure and their far-reaching implications for HEIs' ability to embrace 4IR technologies 
effectively. 
To address these challenges, strategic investments are urgently needed to modernize educational facilities, enhance 
digital literacy initiatives, and foster partnerships between academia, government, and industry. By prioritizing the 
establishment of a robust 4IR ecosystem within HEIs, South Africa can unlock its academic potential, promote equity, 
and prepare students for success in an increasingly digital world. 
In conclusion, collaborative efforts between stakeholders are essential to drive sustainable development and ensure 
that all students have equitable access to the benefits of digital learning. By leveraging the insights gleaned from this 
study, policymakers, educators, and stakeholders can chart a course towards a future characterized by resilience, 
relevance, and digital readiness in South African higher education.

Abstract 
This paper reviews the current state of affairs regarding the application of AI for the modelling and optimisation of 
technological processes. AI is deployed in a plethora of different ways for these purposes. In addition to facilitating 
modelling, it is also used to determine the optimum procedures and sequences for technological processes and 
operations. Further to this, it is employed in efforts to eliminate disturbances in processes and can model quality 
outcomes based on which parameters are set in production processes and establish which parameters should be put in 
place. AI-based algorithms have been developed that are capable of enhancing models of the optimal controlling of 
multi-parameter processes and optimising process parameters. They can help to model processes that provide the 
optimum balance between efficiency and quality. They are also capable of providing machine-generated advice to 
those involved in facilitating technological processes. Furthermore, AI is used to provide visualisations of processes 
in order to inform decisions regarding their optimisation. It can inform the tools that are best suited for use in processes 
and the workpiece-instrumentation selection. It can also be used to inform the best choice of equipment to use in 
conjunction with specific machinery in processes. A system involving AI has also been devised to describe incomplete 
data and uncertainties within technological processes so that efforts can be made to mitigate them. It can aid in the 
selection of the optimum materials for use in manufacturing processes and can also help to align plans for processes 
with the particular needs of companies. Other uses of AI for process modelling and optimisation include identifying 
process fingerprints, extending the capabilities of surrogate-based optimisation, and noising monitoring signals that 
transfer data from technological equipment to computers to enable process optimisation. This paper outlines the use 
of AI for these purposes and provides information of how it is deployed to achieve these aims when possible. It aims 
to provide a holistic summary and discussion of various AI-related applications regarding process modelling and 
optimisation. Furthermore, it discusses some of the underlying mechanisms for the AI algorithms. It is concluded that 
AI is utilised for a wide variety of different tasks related to these areas and that it is likely to become an increasingly 
indispensable tool for enhancing processes throughout the years to come. Some predictions for future innovations that 
are likely to enter usage are also presented.

Abstract 
An angioplasty medical procedure is the most effective method currently used to treat a blocked coronary artery. It is 
carried out by trying to insert a mesh-shaped tubular medical device called a stent inside the blocked coronary artery 
to expand it and allow blood to pass through the damaged blood vessel. The properties of the stent play a significant 
role in determining its behavior after being implanted in a human body. The Technique for Ordering Performance by 
Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to choose the best material for a stent. A set of materials that are 
suitable for the ideal stent's properties has been chosen. These materials have then been contrasted based on a set of 
criteria including biocompatibility, visibility to x-ray, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, 
and ductility. The developed model results show that cobalt-chromium alloy ranks first among the alloys and refractory 
metals studied based on the considered criteria.

1. Introduction
The cardiovascular system is made up of a lot of blood vessels and a heart. The heart's job is to pump blood and 
oxygen through a system of blood vessels to the various parts of the body (Humphery and McCullosh 2003). Recently, 
there has been a sharp rise in cardiovascular disease, which has raised the global death rate (Udriṣte et al 2021). Any 
deterioration or damage to the coronary arteries or the vessels that branch off of them constitutes cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) (Gaziano et al 2006). The internal wall of the coronary artery is where fat or lipid substances build up 
over time, and this accumulation is what causes the vessel blockage (Pan et al 2021). These deposits (fat and lipid 
substances) combine to form numerous plaques; as the plaque accumulated, the coronary artery's thickness increased, 
leading to a vascular blockage and restricting blood flow (Pan et al 2021). Numerous factors contributed to the buildup 
of these plaques in the arteries, including smoking, high cholesterol levels, a sudden rise in blood pressure, an increase 
in blood sugar levels, recurrent heavy alcohol consumption, a sedentary lifestyle (less physical activity), and a 
deficiency in fruit consumption (Kerkar 2017). The most effective method currently used in medical procedures to 
treat a blocked coronary artery is known as angioplasty (Pan et al 2021). This is carried out by trying to insert a mesh-
shaped tubular medical device called a stent inside the blocked coronary to expand it and allow blood to pass through 
the damaged blood vessel (Yoshino and Inoue 2010, Schneider and Dichek 1997). In balloon angioplasty, a small 
balloon is pressed onto the catheter and inserted through various human arteries after making an incision in the groin, 
neck, or wrist. This process is repeated until the catheter is delivered to the precise location of the blockage as guided 
by a special X-ray machine. Once the catheter has reached the proper obstruction, air pressure will inflate the 
compressed balloon. The plaques in the blocked coronary artery will be compressed as a result, causing blood to flow 
back through the artery. The balloon will then deflate and be extracted from the artery using the catheter (Kulathilake 
2017). When a stent is implanted through the artery, the cells on the internal coronary artery grow toward the stent,

6. Conclusions 
A stent is the most effective device that is used to expand the blocked coronary artery; its properties play a significant 
role in determining its behavior after being implanted in a human body. In this study, research on the material 
properties required for such a product has been conducted, and then the TOPSIS decision-making method was used 
to select the best material for this application. In light of the attained results, the following points can be attained: 
 
• 
The stent material should be biocompatible, have high visibility to x-ray, high yield strength, high ultimate tensile 
strength, a high modulus of elasticity, and high ductility. 
• 
Ceramic materials can’t be used for this product because of their poor ductility. 
• 
Polymer materials can’t be used for this product because of their poor visibility from x-rays. 
• 
TOPSIS decision-making results show that cobalt-chromium alloy ranks first among the alloys and refractory 
metals studied based on the considered criteria.

Abstract 
This paper investigates the factors influencing the adoption of AI-chatbots by non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) in developing countries, a context faced with escalating social and environmental challenges. As poverty 
deepens, climate-induced droughts persist, and regional conflicts escalate, the demand for effective NGO intervention 
increases. NGOs are critical in addressing social, environmental, and economic issues, often filling gaps where 
governmental support is lacking. Despite a global increase in innovative technologies, the uptake of AI-chatbots by 
NGOs is still in its infancy. Furthermore, there is limited literature providing a comprehensive factors for NGOs to 
adopt AI-chatbots. This qualitative study interviews 30 managers for in-depth insights. The study examines 
technological, organisational, and environmental aspects affecting AI-chatbot adoption using the TOE paradigm. 
Thematic analysis of the qualitative data identified key factors such as a lack of technical expertise, financial 
constraints, resistance to change, data privacy and security concerns and infrastructure limitations as the most 
dominant factors in adopting chatbots. The factors address a gap in the literature by providing insights into the adoption 
of technology in resource-constrained settings, offering operational, technical, and strategic guidance to NGO 
managers and policymakers.

1. Introduction
Over the past several years, there has been a significant change in how organisations integrate technology into their 
operations and interact with their stakeholders(Abdallah et al. 2023; Dwivedi et al. 2021; Pillai and Sivathanu 2020). 
Artificial Intelligence is a powerful tool that is transforming many industry sectors and revolutionising communication 
channels(Adam et al. 2020). Among the myriads of AI-driven innovations, chatbots have gained substantial 
recognition for their capacity to automate and enhance customer interactions, streamline operations, and provide a 
more personalized user experience (Han et al. 2021; Palanica et al. 2019; Sharma et al. 2024; Zhu et al. 2022). 
The use of AI chatbots spans various domains and industries, reflecting their versatility, adaptability, and potential 
impact. AI chatbots have been acknowledged for their capacity to address the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically in 
the fields of public health, chronic disease management, and mental health. This indicates a positive outlook for the 
future of healthcare (Mahdavi et al. 2023). In the tourism and hospitality industries, AI chatbots are a relatively new 
technology, and their use and impact are areas of ongoing exploration(Bahreini et al. 2023; Benaddi et al. 2024; 
Chavan et al. 2024). In addition, AI chatbots are making substantial progress in the field of education, improving 
individualised learning experiences, offering immediate feedback, and assisting with administrative duties (Dube et 
al. 2024). Additionally, the innovative use of chatbots from an employee benefits perspective has been a significant 
focus, contributing to the advancement of AI literature (Balcioğlu and Artar 2024). Organizations that fail to embrace 
emerging technologies such as AI chatbots risk falling behind their competitors and missing out on crucial 
opportunities for growth and adaptation(Heo and Lee 2018; Nadarzynski et al. 2019). For example, Blockbuster's

advantages and difficulties associated with these technologies. Such research would shed light on the evolution of 
NGOs in their utilisation of AI chatbots and the long-term viability of the early benefits. Further investigation is 
warranted to explore the intricacies of AI chatbot deployment, analysing various AI solutions offered in the market, 
their distinct characteristics, and their compatibility with the requirements of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). 
Comparative analyses of various AI chatbot technologies could help identify best practices and guide NGOs in 
selecting the most appropriate solutions. Further studies should consider the wide variability in technological 
capabilities among NGOs, developing frameworks or toolkits that provide tailored guidance for NGOs at different 
levels of technological readiness. This would ensure that even organizations with limited resources can effectively 
adopt and benefit from AI chatbots. Future work should continue to explore the ethical implications of AI chatbot 
deployment in NGOs, developing comprehensive guidelines and frameworks to address data privacy, security, and 
ethical concerns. Research could also focus on stakeholder perceptions and the development of strategies to ensure 
ethical AI usage. Investigating the role of policy and regulatory frameworks in AI chatbot adoption is crucial, 
examining how existing regulations impact the deployment of AI technologies in NGOs and identifying areas where 
policy changes could facilitate smoother adoption. Engaging with policymakers to develop supportive regulatory 
environments would be beneficial. Encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing among NGOs, technology 
providers, and academic institutions can significantly enhance the adoption process. Future work could explore the 
development of collaborative platforms where NGOs can share experiences, challenges, and best practices, facilitating 
access to technical expertise and resources.  
 
7. Conclusion 
This study has examined the implementation of AI chatbots in non-governmental organisations (NGOs), identifying 
significant obstacles, prospects, and factors that have an impact. Although AI chatbots provide prospective advantages 
such as increased productivity, greater communication, and cost reduction, the process of implementing them is 
hindered by barriers such as expensive installation costs, limited technical knowledge, and concerns around data 
protection. By addressing these challenges through targeted strategies like capacity building, pilot projects, and 
securing external support, NGOs can better navigate the complexities of AI chatbot adoption. The research highlights 
the importance of continuous training, clear communication, and robust ethical guidelines to ensure successful 
implementation and sustainable use of AI technologies. Future research should focus on expanding sample diversity, 
conducting longitudinal studies, and exploring technical and ethical aspects in greater depth to further support NGOs 
in leveraging AI chatbots for enhanced service delivery and operational efficiency.

Abstract 
Mental health issues affect university students, particularly from developing countries, who are mostly faced with 
social, economic, and environmental challenges, which significantly impact students’ academic performance and well-
being. Furthermore, the literature shows that seeking professional mental health support is usually associated with 
excessive costs and stigmatization. Moreover, existing generic Chatbots do not address the specific contextual needs 
of students. This paper therefore presents a Chatbot tailored for students from a developing country context. 
Qualitative data were collected from ten final-year undergraduate students with a mental breakdown who are currently 
enrolled at a single university case in Zimbabwe. A thematic analysis of collected data provided key constructs for 
designing a Chatbot that employs natural language understanding techniques to afford university students a convenient 
platform for acquiring mental health support. Kanban methodology was employed to develop the machine learning 
Chatbot using the Rasa open-source framework which is a development framework that provides open-source tools 
and libraries for building conversational chatbots, leveraging a collection of different pre-trained and customizable 
machine-learning models for varying tasks within the chatbot such as intent classification, entity recognition, and 
natural language understanding. The findings from this research reveal that university students appreciate this 
innovative approach that promotes a private and user-friendly environment for their mental health care. The findings 
also suggest that students who experience mental breakdown only prefer to use Chatbots as an alternative intervention 
rather than a replacement for mental health professionals due to the unpredictable performance of chatbots, which 
sometimes results in inconsistent and varying solutions for mental health care. These findings add value to the 
knowledge body and impact university students who can now freely access mental health support without 
stigmatization. The parents or guardians of affected students can now be relieved from incurring high costs for some 
avoidable professional mental health services for their children. Lecturers can lecture and impart knowledge to 
mentally relieved, present, and attentive students. The findings also add to the university management’s understanding 
of the student's mental health needs and, can be able to strategize policies aimed at minimizing students’ mental 
breakdown and recurrences.

6. Conclusion 
This study introduced a mental health Chatbot for university students’ mental health support and encouragement. 
Chatbot was made to employ natural language understanding behavioral activation, and self-confidence training. This 
will help the students better manage their feelings, thoughts, and actions and improve their quality of life. The study 
also examined the effectiveness of mental health Chatbots in addressing and reducing mental health challenges among 
university students. The findings indicated users generally accepted the use of mental health Chatbots if they are not 
used as a standalone but as a complement for professional mental health services during times of distress and when 
they need some knowledge related to mental health and coping mechanisms. However, more research to fully 
understand the long-term effectiveness of chatbots in handling mental health issues can be further explored as the 
behavior of the chatbots differs and mental distress affects individuals differently. 
 
Furthermore, integrating a chatbot with existing university support systems is also necessary. There is also a need for 
University Program Recommendation systems such as (Ndlovu et al. 2023) in addition to considering personality type 
and academic results, to incorporate a student's mental health status. By understanding a student's current mental well-
being, the system could recommend programs or resources that can better support their academic success and overall 
well-being. This could include recommending programs that focus on stress management, time management, or study 
skills, depending on the student's specific needs. However, cyber security, privacy and awareness concerns need to be 
addressed to safeguard the use of these systems (Maguraushe 2024). This chatbot can be integrated with the 
Cybersecurity and Awareness Framework  (Mutunhu et al. 2022) to provide students with information on identifying 
and avoiding cyber threats, protecting their personal information, and practicing safe online habits. By promoting 
digital literacy alongside mental health support, the chatbot can contribute to a more well-rounded student experience.

Abstract 
This study focuses on revolutionizing the logistics landscape within the Philippine Army, specifically addressing 
challenges in the requisition process at various hierarchical levels. The Total Addressable Market (TAM) encompasses 
230 units spanning the Area Command, Infantry Brigade and Battalion, Civil-Military Battalion, and other 
independent units. Each unit operates with dedicated logistics sections responsible for meeting specific needs and 
submitting requisition requests to higher headquarters. The Serviceable Available Market (SAM) narrows down to the 
Infantry Battalion, totaling 102 units distributed across the Philippine Archipelago. The study aims to alleviate 
challenges faced by the Infantry Battalion's logistics section due to manual and decentralized processes, leading to 
delays and inefficiencies in meeting unit needs. The proposed project, the Philippine Army Requisition Database 
System (PARDS), targets to enhance the current logistics system, particularly focusing on the Infantry Battalion. 
Further concentration is directed at the Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) represented by 47 Infantry Battalions 
stationed in Luzon. By starting in this region, the project seeks to evaluate effectiveness, gather feedback, and refine 
solutions in collaboration with field units. Upon successful implementation and positive impact assessment, the project 
envisions expansion to Visayas and Mindanao, scaling gradually to meet diverse regional needs. The strategic 
approach aims to enhance overall logistics capabilities, streamline operations, and support Philippine Army units 
efficiently and effectively in their critical missions. The primary market for the PARDS application is the Infantry 
Battalion logistician field, represented by Logistics Officers. Their responsibilities include making logistics requests, 
ensuring adequate supplies for troop needs, and managing logistical operations and supply chain activities. This study

Abstract 
The automotive industry faces growing demands and technological shifts, necessitating new approaches. In the context 
of increasing sustainability requirements, the future car must remain adaptable throughout its lifecycle. Similar to 
smartphones, it should receive over-the-air updates to extend its functionality. Achieving this requires fundamental 
changes in electronics, software, hardware architecture, and development processes. The authors face part of these 
challenges as part of the project Software-Defined Car (SofDCar). This paper addresses different aspects in context 
of product planning and product development for a software-defined car. The aim and vision of a methodological 
overall framework was broken down to the goal of creating an initial framework. This idea includes three fields with 
several approaches. The first field focuses on the development of a roadmap based on future scenarios. With two 
approaches, a cross-generational roadmap for the implementation of product properties was developed in this research 
based on changing product properties, robustness and innovation potential. Further, an initial approach was developed 
to continuously monitor the roadmap against the future environment to be able to anticipate and implement them into 
the car. The second field focuses on validation of the identified product needs by assessing the products future benefits. 
Based on these benefits, requirements for the validation system are derived. To enable updates and upgrades, planned 
product properties must be designed for extensibility and exchangeability. Hence, the characterization of the design 
space was focused within the third field. An approach was developed to define modules by considering suitable 
interfaces and standardization using design-for-modularization.

1. Introduction
The constantly growing and evolving requirements of users and technological changes in the mobility industry are 
forcing the automotive industry to adopt new approaches. In the context of growing sustainability requirements, the 
car of the future must be adaptable throughout its life cycle, for example to implement new functionalities via over-
the-air updates and thus extend its operating life. This should work in a similar way to a smartphone, whose functions 
can be changed using apps. To enable this, the electronics, software and hardware architecture in the car as well as the 
development methods and processes must be fundamentally changed and developed to positively shape the 
technological requirements of digitalization. By developing new methods and concepts, it should be possible to 
anticipate, plan and validate requirements and product functions of a car across all development stages. These 
challenges are being addressed in several sub-work packages in the Software-Defined Car (SofDCar) consortium 
project which is part of a government-sponsored research program and founded by the German Ministry of Business 
Affairs and Climate Control (BMWK). (SofDCar Website 2024; SofDCar Project Proposal 2021).

certain company. The interaction – and thus the impacts – between software and hardware domain needs to be 
investigated in more detail, which is already planned in the special research field (SFB) convide, where researchers 
of informatics, electronics and mechanics work together to better understand the independencies and find ways to 
improve the collaboration in both research and industry.

Abstract 
The design of solar energy systems poses significant challenges, encompassing issues related to infrastructure, 
installation costs, and land availability and selection. In the practical implementation of such projects, location 
selection is critically dependent on numerous vital criteria, one of which is the estimation of received solar radiation. 
For instance, solar radiation estimation is pivotal for designing proper energy storage systems, balancing load, and 
managing photovoltaic and thermal systems. Machine and deep learning approaches have been commonly utilized in 
solar radiation forecasting and estimation. This paper deploys multiple deep learning techniques, including feed-
forward neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to estimate 
the amount of Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) received in the city of Tustin, California, using multiple 
metrological factors. California was selected for this study because it is characterized by receiving high amounts of 
solar radiation and large amounts of solar energy installations and projects. The paper compares the three examined 
deep learning methods using the commonly used evaluation metric, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The 
findings indicate that the LSTM approach is the most effective deep learning technique for estimating the hourly GHI. 
Keywords 
Deep learning, Forecasting, Global horizontal irradiance, Solar radiation. 
1. Introduction
In the modern era, energy plays a huge role in the industrialization and development of societies. Burning fossil fuels 
is the main energy source and significantly meets global energy loads (Daut et al., 2011). Fossil fuel provisions are 
finite, and their use has detrimental effects on the environment (Daut et al., 2011). They release many toxicants that 
disrupt the planet's ecological life and lead to various human ailments. Hence, it is crucial to reduce the dependence 
on fossil-based fuels and replace them with renewable and sustainable energy sources (Ibrahim et al., 2012). Solar 
energy has seen a sharp increase in popularity in recent years because of its abundance, declining cost compared to 
other sustainable energy sources, and ease of conversion into other useful forms of electrical energy. Designing solar 
energy conversion systems and several agricultural applications requires good solar radiation estimation. However, 
most weather stations need more modern and accurate solar radiation measurement devices, yet they have accurate 
temperature and wind speed sensors (Ouammi et al., 2010). Additionally, many developing countries that rely on 
agriculture lack access to reliable sources for solar radiation measurements (Shahsavar and Akbari, 2018). Thus, 
researchers tried to develop accurate solar radiation estimation models. The estimation models can be categorized into 
three classes: empirical models, statistical models, and machine learning models. Empirical methods include linear 
and nonlinear regression models. These models are easy to use and implement but don't provide the highest accuracy 
(Gomila, 2021). Statistical models encompass time-series and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) 
models (Kaur and Rakshit, 2020). Lastly, machine and deep learning models and algorithms, such as support vector 
machines and neural networks, provide the best possible performance compared to other models (Kumari and 
Toshniwal, 2021; Gürel et al., 2023). In addition, machine learning models perform reasonably well under various 
operating conditions (Sivamadhavi, V. and Selvaraj, 2012). In this paper, deep learning models such as Artificial 
694","Figure 2. Actual and predicted GHI values using CNN. 
The findings indicate that LSTM and CNN produced almost identical forecasting performance, while the ANN 
delivered the weakest performance. This can be mainly attributed to the inherent characteristics of CNN and LSTM 
that enable them to remember patterns over extended periods of time (Lu et al., 2020). Moreover, CNN can make 
accurate predictions and estimations because of the filters that allow the network to compute the dilations between 
various cells (Wibawa et al., 2022). Table 4 summarizes the RMSE  for all the deep learning models presented in this 
paper.

4. Conclusion 
Energy is a critical sector in any country’s economy. In the past few years, governments started opting for more 
sustainable and renewable energy sources to fight global warming and contribute to achieving the Paris Agreement 
goals. In parallel, solar energy has become a more accessible and viable option for various countries. However, some 
developing countries lack modern equipment and methods to help forecast solar radiation, which is pivotal for solar 
energy installations and projects.  Consequently, this paper aims to develop and compare various deep learning 
univariate models, namely ANN, CNN, and LSTM, to predict the hourly GHI in the city of Tustin, California. The 
study employed RMSE as a performance measure to facilitate the models’ comparison. The findings suggested that 
ANN produces the lowest performance, as indicated by the high RMSE value of 317.53. In contrast, both CNN and 
LSTM produced comparable performance with RMSE values of 71 and 76.18, respectively. The findings of the paper 
can hold significant implications for sustainable and renewable energy advocates interested in solar energy installation 
projects in the city of Tustin or any other city with comparable climate conditions. Moreover, the paper contributes to 
the academic literature on solar radiation predictions and estimations by deploying three univariate deep-learning 
approaches to predict the hourly GHI. Future studies can encompass the exploration of different learning rates and the

be studied and analyzed. Advanced techniques like adaptive learning rate and the integration of several deep leaning 
networks are also worth considering.

Abstract 
Chronic diseases have continued to put immense pressure on healthcare facilities, particularly in the developing world, 
through inefficient management besides high incidence and prevalence. Modern healthcare systems do not have 
individualized strategies thus limiting preventative steps and management of chronic diseases. This leads to a very 
important topic – medication non-adherence. This research intended to improve disease prediction and management 
by creating an effective model that can predict the possibilities of non-compliance with the medication among chronic 
disease patients. Using the cross-sectional qualitative data from a developing country and the CRISP-DM method, the 
study employed Recurrent Neural Networks. The model fared better than other approaches like Naïve Bayes, Decision 
Trees and Support Vector Machines in terms of predicting chances of missed medication doses among chronic 
patients. The successful performance of the model validates the usefulness of the proposed method in this critical 
application domain. The research provides real life recommendations on how communication can be useful in the case 
of chronic diseases and compliance with medication, which is a concern in health systems around the world. The 
model offers a better solution in a situation where other chronic cases could have been managed properly and required 
less facilities and cost.

1. Introduction
Chronic diseases or non-communicable diseases or, plus diabetes, cardiac diseases, and respiratory illnesses, are 
among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide (Maguraushe 2024). In the current world especially 
the developing countries, the health facilities experience a flood of patients with such diseases (Thandu and Gera 
2023). Failure to manage chronic diseases not only reduces the well-being of patients but also the mortality and 
morbidity rates (Mutunhu et al. 2022). Another challenge that is common in chronic diseases is medication non-
compliance, whereby patients do not adhere to the recommended dosage as prescribed. This can lead to worsening of 
the disease condition, hospitalization, and sometimes death (Mpofu et al. 2024). More importantly in developing 
countries there are different factors that may affect medication non-adherence among the chronic patients like 
education, income, and availability of family members. Conventional health management interventions do not 
incorporate individual plans in handling medication non-compliance thus poor compliance with prescribed treatments 
(Kim et al. 2019). The growth of technology especially in the area of big data is a solution to enhancing personalized 
client healthcare for chronic diseases. With the help of big data analytics in healthcare, providers can create models

5.4 Recommendations 
Zimbabwe should consider enforcing creation and maintenance of National Health Data Repositories, also establish 
systems that use such Predictive models for personalized healthcare management for patients with chronic diseases. 
Future research could focus on seamlessly integrating predictive models with Electronic Health Records (EHR) to 
facilitate real-time data extraction and prediction. Additionally foster self quantification practices amongst people 
with non-communicable diseases such as diabetes as the increase of health care personlisation (Mutunhu,Chipangura, 
Singh 2024). Create and put into action customised adherence-promotion plans, such as better patient-provider 
contact, medication management support, and personalised patient education, depending on the insights gleaned from 
the prediction model and assess how well these strategies work to improve patients' health outcomes and medication 
adherence in chronic illness patients.  
 
7. Conclusion 
The goal of this research was to create a reliable research model to predict times when chronic disease patients should 
not be expected to fully adhere to their prescribed medications schedule. The observations made and implications 
outlined in this study provide valuable understanding of the determinants of medication noncompliance in chronic 
diseases. Consequently, the study recommends that it would be beneficial for the healthcare systems to implement 
specific prevention campaigns and information dissemination plans, especially for individuals with multiple chronic 
diseases or population groups with complex or difficult social conditions. Such interventions should use patient-
specific adherence assessment models that consider factors such as age, comorbidities, socioeconomic status and the 
interaction between the patient and the healthcare provider to facilitate the adherence to recommended evidence-based 
strategies.

VR and AR in education. A systematic review was conducted by searching four databases published in 2020. 
Nineteen (19) articles met the final inclusion criteria. The findings reveal that the factors influencing adoption of 
VR and AR are ease of use, immersion, perceived ease of use, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy, 
while the opportunities presented are collaboration, immersion learning, increased creativity and innovation, and 
remote learning. Drawing from these findings, this study developed a conceptual framework that can act as a 
guide for educational practitioners, school heads, and education policymakers when adopting these transformative 
technologies.

1. Introduction
The incorporation of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in education has garnered 
significant attention due to their potential to create immersive and interactive learning experiences against the 
traditional learning system, which often emphasizes passive learning, focusing on memorization and rote learning 
(Negi 2024). By adopting these simulation technologies that mimic real-world scenarios and real-life objects, VR 
and AR provide experimental learning opportunities that fulfil the United Nations strategic development goal 
(SDG) number 4, which stresses quality education. According to (Wetzstein 2020), VR and AR are projected to 
grow by 29.6% between 2023 and 2028 in its Augmented and Virtual Reality in Education market report published 
in July 2023. This technology is offered through simulation software applications on an array of devices like 
Google, smartphones, tablets, and many other forms (Di Natale et al. 2024) (Murala 2024)(da Silva et al. 2019). 
These technologies have been around for some time now, and their adoption has been mainly focused on the 
design and development of VR and AR systems (da Silva et al. 2019) (Kurniawan, no date) (Fokides and 
Antonopoulos 2024)In the educational field, this is still an emerging technology due to its exciting immersive 
effects, which are engaging and expressive. However, despite their potential in enhancing student learning 
outcomes in education (Noble Saville and Foster 2022) (Ndlovu et al. 2022)they have faced serious challenges, 
including prohibitive costs, technological complexities, and resistance to change by educators, amongst many 
others (Pan et al. 2021)(Hajirasouli and Banihashemi 2022)(Kavanagh et al. 2017)((Ndlovu et al. 
2022)Additionally, concerns about the pedagogical effectiveness of VR and AR and the lack of robust evidence 
supporting their impact on learning outcomes contribute to hesitancy among educational institutions to invest in

6. Conclusion 
6.1Conclusions, limitations and recommendations 
In conclusion, this paper highlights the multifaceted nature of VR and AR adoption in education. Most of the 
articles reviewed focused on feedback from learners, teachers, and workers, proving the motivational power of 
the technologies. The barriers are equipment prices, technical complications, and accessibility. However, most 
studies envision a rapid adoption increase driven by affordability, accessibility, and enhanced content 
development. These findings demonstrate the importance of VR and AR in sustainability education and the 
necessity for innovation and collaboration in this dynamic field. From our research, it was noted that Africa is 
lagging in the adoption of AR and VR in education. Future research should be targeted at Africa. The language 
restriction is a limitation to our study since relevant papers written in non-English languages might have been 
omitted. The keywords that we used in the databases might have excluded some relevant articles. There might be 
a need to broaden the search strategy.

Abstract 
The broad adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies across industries has raised several important ethical 
debates. Concerns that AI systems will exhibit biases, affect individual privacy, and raise issues of accountability 
surrounding the use of advanced technologies are some of the most critical points. While most AI frameworks address 
responsible use, the importance of informed consent and data privacy are some grey areas that remain untouched by 
most researchers due to the dynamic nature of AI development itself. This paper aims to develop a holistic ethical AI 
framework that balances ethics, privacy, consent, and responsible use. The researchers conducted a systematic 
literature review (SLR) using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
spanning the years 2020 to 2024, with IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, and ACM being the primary databases. 
A total of 29 papers met the final inclusion criteria. The researchers managed to identify the main features of AI 
frameworks as privacy, transparency, fairness, trust, security, and accountability. Other features were responsible use, 
good governance, autonomy, data protection, and explainability. The tools used to evaluate existing ethical 
frameworks in the observed studies were Bias Detection Algorithms, Deep Learning techniques, and Natural 
Language Processing. Most studies did not include any tools for evaluating ethical frameworks. According to the 
observed studies, healthcare was the most prominent application area contributing to more than half compared to other 
areas like finance, education, transport, information technology, and governance. The main challenges surrounding 
the privacy and security of AI frameworks were a lack of transparency and compliance, raising concerns about data 
misuse and user privacy. Security vulnerabilities and breaches of user information further highlight the need for stricter 
governance and user control. This paper will provide a comprehensive analysis of the research findings and identify 
research gaps for future research such as aspects/features, application areas, and tools used to evaluate the ethical 
soundness and challenges surrounding the privacy and security of AI frameworks.

1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming our world, with applications impacting nearly every facet of society. 
AI is the new gold rush of the 21st century with tech giants like Meta, Open AI, and Google scrambling to have a 
superior model that will take a large piece of the market (Landi 2024). This progress, however, is not without its 
challenges. According to Korobenko et al. (2024), this has caused AI developers to go to extreme lengths to get 
training data to win the AI race, resulting in many ethical meltdowns and privacy breaches. Concerns regarding the 
ethical implications of AI development and deployment are growing (Korobenko et al. 2024). At the forefront of these

Abstract 
In this research paper, an intelligent route selection strategy is proposed for optimizing transportation networks. The 
propose strategy is inspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The present approach aims to maximize overall 
system performance by considering factors such as route diversity, fuel consumption, trip duration, and 
environmental impact. ACO is known for its adaptive and decentralized nature, which allows it to adjust to changing 
conditions and dynamic network scenarios. The algorithm mimics the decentralized and adaptive foraging behaviour 
of ants, enabling it to constantly modify route choices based on current conditions through pheromone 
communication and iterative processes. By using this ACO-inspired algorithm, transportation networks can achieve 
resource-optimized, time-efficient, and cost-effective transportation. The research also proposes an adaptive 
approach for updating pheromones based on real-time congestion levels, allowing for dynamic and real-time 
modifications to the algorithm. One of the novel aspects of this research is the incorporation of a fuel consumption 
model in addition to conventional route optimization measures, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the 
algorithm's effectiveness in a transportation network. Additionally, the research utilizes parallel computing to 
improve simulation performance when dealing with a large number of vehicles and iterations. Overall, this research 
presents a promising approach to optimize transportation networks, offering insights into emerging mobility patterns 
and potentially improving overall system efficiency.

Introduction
In transportation networks, route selection optimization is a complicated and significant issue with wide-ranging 
effects on cost, effectiveness, and environmental impact (Dijkstra, 1959 and Hart, et.al. 1968). As our societies 
become increasingly interconnected and reliant on complex transportation networks, there is an increasing demand

5. Conclusion and Future Scope 
The proposed ACO-inspired algorithm revolutionizes route selection in transportation networks by mimicking ant 
foraging behavior. It improves performance, reduces costs, and optimizes traffic flow. The algorithm uses 
pheromones to represent route desirability, which are dynamically adjusted through decay processes and simulation 
to continuously optimize the transportation network. Inspired by the collective intelligence of ant colonies, this 
algorithm offers resource-efficient, time-effective, and cost-saving route selection techniques. By leveraging this 
approach, transportation networks can achieve resource-optimized, time-efficient, and cost-effective transportation. 
The algorithm aims to revolutionize route selection techniques, bringing flexibility and efficiency to transportation 
networks by drawing from the collective intelligence of ant colonies. This innovative approach has the potential to 
enhance transportation networks and their economic and environmental impacts. The algorithm's success is 
demonstrated through various numerical metrics, including exploration-exploitation balance, average journey time, 
total waiting time, route diversity, and convergence rate. Its dual-objective optimization methodology, which 
combines traditional emphasis on travel time with consideration of fuel consumption, sets it apart. This unique 
combination provides a more comprehensive and environmentally sensitive approach to route selection, advancing 
the field of intelligent transportation systems. The future scope of the proposed ACO-inspired algorithm for route 
selection in transportation networks is vast and holds potential for significant advancements in the field of intelligent 
transportation systems. Some potential future directions and enhancements include: (a) integrating the algorithm with 
smart city initiatives to create more efficient and sustainable transportation systems that are integrated with other 
urban systems; (b) integrating machine learning techniques to enhance the algorithm's ability to learn and adapt to 
changing transportation patterns and user preference.

Abstract 
Cost overruns have harmed the economies and reputations of several construction companies around the world. Many 
project management systems have been deve1oped to keep track of a project's budget. However, due to several cost 
overrun difficulties in the construction industry, cost management is still deemed inadequate. As a result, the goal of 
this term paper is to identify and group prospective construction project cost overrun reasons based on their origin 
groups. Basically, all potential cost overrun elements were rigorously checked through literature analysis before being 
divided into seven (7) groups of originating components, including project, contract, client, contractor, consultant, 
labor, and external. Each potential factor was comp1etely defined with examples.

Abstract 
Manufacturing industries must address the needs of their human resources to maintain efficiency and profitability in 
the global markets. By fostering safe, psychologically supportive working conditions, companies can improve work 
performance and retain their workforce in the face of labor shortage. Monitoring mental workload, and in particular 
mental overload, which occurs when the cognitive resources needed for task performance exceed the operator's 
capacity, is a promising approach when addressing this issue. Previous research has mainly focused on individual 
assessments of mental workload. When assessing workload at the team level, one approach is to simply aggregate 
individual metrics. In order to reduce the loss of information due to this data aggregation, we are exploring a novel 
way of measuring the mental workload of teams: Physiological Synchrony (PS). This exploratory study, involving 75 
participants grouped into five-person teams, investigates the relationship between classical team-level metrics and PS 
during a complex virtual reality task. PS is calculated using Multidimensional Recurrence Quantification Analysis. A 
significant difference in aggregated team workload was observed between high and low synchronized teams, with 
higher synchronized teams exhibiting a lower aggregated workload. These results suggest that PS may be a suitable 
measure of mental workload at the team level.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing companies require more than lean processes and advanced technology to ensure high levels of 
productivity, competitiveness, and profitability in the global markets. They need to prioritize the needs of their most 
valuable resource: skilled and trained human workers. This is particularly important in the context of labor shortages. 
In a 2023 report, the German Federal Employment Agency (Bundesagentur für Arbeit) identified 200 different 
occupations facing critical labor shortages in 2022, compared with 148 occupations at risk in the previous year. 
According to the report, this increase is attributed to a general shortage of staff. Similarly, Bossler and Popp (2023) 
report that employers are finding it increasingly challenging to recruit skilled workers, as vacancies reach 
unprecedented levels, and the number of job seekers declines. They highlight the rising costs associated with hiring 
new employees and recommend implementing methods to retain the current workforce by making the workplace more 
attractive.  
Given the challenges of attracting and retaining skilled workers, it is crucial for companies to maintain the health and 
well-being of their existing workforce. This is becoming increasingly important as the German population - and 
therefore the workforce - ages. The rising number of sick days underlines the importance of effectively managing

Abstract 
Urban logistics focuses on finding efficient and effective ways to transport goods in urban areas, which is crucial for 
timely supply delivery to residents. The importance of urban logistics was greatly amplified during the COVID-19 
outbreak. However, urban logistics can also create significant social, environmental, and economic issues in urban 
landscapes. These contrasting factors make designing and managing an urban logistics system particularly 
challenging. Metropolises like Singapore constantly face these challenges, and policymakers must understand the 
urban logistics system and its associated difficulties to develop appropriate strategies. In our research, we employed a 
foresight study to comprehend the challenges urban logistics faces in the context of Singapore. We conducted 
extensive environmental and technological scanning to identify the primary challenges Singapore will encounter. Our 
findings revealed that issues such as energy uncertainty, climate change, and traffic congestion pose significant 
challenges to designing an effective urban logistics system. Additionally, regulatory measures and demographic 
considerations further complicate the situation. Addressing these issues is essential when creating a roadmap for 
Singapore's urban logistics system. This study aims to help stakeholders prepare for an uncertain and challenging 
future for Singapore.

Abstract 
This study focuses on the process flow of the third-party logistic (3PL) company. It aims to analyze the operation 
management and processing system using Promodel software, a computer-aided drafting software utilized to simulate 
the operational models of a company. Process enhancement brings about the study's key objective since it is the most 
accessible and requires less intervention in the working environment. While the manpower and material are 
insufficient, the study aims to mitigate the problems by providing suggestions regarding the company’s process. This 
paper found operational inefficiencies resulting from poor operation management using the Ishikawa diagram and 
considered the need for change by accounting for the company's current resources. By using Promodel, process 
observation, and time-and-motion study, this paper identified the blocked, operational, and moving rate of the 
company. The assembly line proved to be inefficient with the company’s current resources in which the study 
simulated and proposed a synchronous process model. By implementing a fitting manufacturing model for the 
company, the ability to be productive will be easily achieved. In light of this, the study aims to contribute to the 
effectiveness of the synchronous process model for companies that find limitations in their manpower and locations.

1. Introduction
Planning and coordination include a production management system and control of all aspects of the process in 
production, from the processing of raw materials to testing the finished products. To produce goods in an efficient and 
timely manner, production and operations management ensures the completion of activities to streamline the 
production process of the company.  The role of production management is to ensure that the production process runs 
smoothly and efficiently, with the least possible bottlenecks. Through the collaborative efforts of the various sectors 
in the logistics and supply chain industry of the Philippines, the country's economy has remained robust because of its 
location in the region and of course the major international trade routes. This industry includes transactional and 
physical activities that include transportation, warehousing, distributing, inventory management, and procurement. 
The study focuses on the company's weaknesses in the distribution of the received packages and how well the company 
can release these packages. 
This study identified that there was a need to assess and analyze the current operation management and process system 
of a Third-party logistic service (3PL) company. The study found that inefficiencies of methods implemented in 
786","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

This study identified the difference between the processing results of each location. Table 8 shows the increase of the 
package entry and exit on each location. This study identified that Sorting had increased 2 processed packages and 
Inspection had increased by 24 processed packages. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the study used the current model to assess the effectiveness of the progress assembly to a 3PL company. 
With its given data, this study was able to conclude the current weakness of the company. The study focused on the 
blocked rate and determined that it needs to be reduced so that the operation rate of the company would increase. This 
study concluded the following from the different models. 
 
1. From the current model of a 3PL service company, the study identified that the blocked rate of the company 
was higher than the operation rate of the current model. The identified blocked rate of the current model was 
74.33% while the operation rate was 22.44% The study identified the total package release as 36 packages 
and identified that the manufacturing model of the company was a progressive assembly. According to Ekren 
and Ornek (2008), identifying performance measures through simulation allows a better understanding of the 
company being reviewed. By identifying the blocked rate, the study was able to determine the point for 
improvements It was also stated by Werbinska (2007) that time-redundancy due to downtime leads to the 
inefficiency of logistic services. 
2. The proposed model of this study stems from the batch production manufacturing model where only another 
type of process will be accommodated if all the packages are finished on that particular process.  The closest 
study that was ever conducted in applying the principles of batch production was the article by Li et. al. 
(2015). The synchronous process aims to coordinate each process time to be aligned with other processors as 
it was studied by Anandarajah et. al. (2007) that time synchronization improves process control.  
3. The proposed model of this study resulted in a package release of 69 packages. The proposed model identified 
the values of in move logic, in operation, in blocked rate with values of 12.58%, 41.02%, and 46.41%. 
4. The difference between the current and the proposed model was 24 additional package release. The blocked 
rate reduction was 27.47% and there was an increase in operation rate which was 17.99% while the in-move 
logic increased by 9.48%. 
 
The proposed model of the study was also under the same assumption that there will be the same number of employees 
and locations therefore making it very feasible for the company to adapt the model. This study concluded that the 
progressive assembly may be ineffective if the blocked rate of each location was high, which the study analyzed and 
understood that a synchronized process model that incorporates the idea of batch production would be effective. 
According to Cochran (2001), understanding the relationship between elements of a system design is important. The 
study understood that the blocked rate of the manufacturing model proves to be the greatest obstacle the company 
faces and just cannot be solved easily by changing processes. The study shifted its focus on the conceptual use of the 
company’s manufacturing model and took into consideration the limitations the company faces in providing a suitable 
manufacturing model which was the synchronous process model. This effectively reduced the blocked rate and 
allowed more released packages by the company. 
 
Simply, the study focused on the capability of manpower to effectively utilize different processes for each worker 
rather than designating a person into a specific process. By evening the workload to every worker since they are 
capable of doing each process, the study achieved synchronization between each process which effectively addresses 
the buildups and delays. The application of the conceptual use of batch production which may referred to here in the 
study as batch processing proves that synchronized processing can be utilized in the case of increased processing time 
for each assembly location especially for those companies that face manpower limitations and space constraints. The 
study explores the conceptual use of batch processing for companies that heavily rely on manpower and effectively 
utilize this concept to address multiple issues at once.

Abstract 
The footwear industry continues to produce not only quality shoes but also jobs that contribute to the growth of any 
country’s economy. But as time went by, some of the local shoe manufacturers in the Philippines had stalled in 
developing their production habits which resulted in inefficiency and net loss. The goal of this study is to help them 
identify the factors that cause inefficiency and propose an optimized facility layout which will be vital for the survival 
of their business. In addition, this study presents a comprehensive analysis on an optimized facility layout that any 
footwear production line may use. With the utilization of both qualitative and quantitative research design, this study 
integrates operations management methods such as time-motion study on the application of ProModel Simulation 
software. After introducing changes on the facility layout, change in the average time of production with as much as 
70% will boost efficiency and output of the footwear production. From an average time of 1,521 seconds or 25 minutes 
in the present facility layout, the proposed facility layout introduces reduction in time down to 453 seconds or 7.5 
minutes only. For the future researchers, different layout theories may be used depending on the needs of the 
production line. This study presents the significance of combining traditional operations management methods with 
new technology that produces improved facility layout which is pivotal for the efficiency in production and 
optimization of workflow process.

1. Introduction
In modern business, efficiency is not just a goal but a necessity for achieving organizational success. It drives 
productivity, reduces costs, and enhances competitiveness, forming the bedrock upon which companies build their 
operational strategies (Slack et al., 2019). Central to achieving this efficiency is the field of operations management, 
which is dedicated to the meticulous coordination of resources and procedures to streamline operations and maximize 
output.The evolution of technology has introduced advanced tools for data analysis, process automation, and 
performance improvement, fundamentally transforming traditional operational procedures. Industry software 
applications have played a pivotal role in this transformation, offering sophisticated solutions that enhance the 
accuracy and efficiency of operations. This study delves into the mutually beneficial interaction between industry 
software applications and operations management methods. Specifically, it explores how these integrated approaches 
can significantly improve organizational effectiveness within the context of a footwear manufacturing company. The 
primary aim of this study is to apply ProModel software and operational methods to the operational process 
optimization of a footwear manufacturer. Promodel software, known for its simulation capabilities, alongside time-
motion study, provides a powerful framework for analyzing and improving operational workflows. By employing

6. Conclusion  
The tables above produced by the integration of operations management methods and ProModel simulation give a 
point-by-point correlation between the current and proposed times for different tasks in footwear manufacturing. As 
determined by Haekal, J. (2021), software integration has helped us in determining the bottlenecks, resource allocation 
optimization, and production scheduling improvement with new facility layout. These examinations feature the 
potential time reserve funds that are feasible by executing the proposed changes. Changes in the upper-part sewing 
alone, for instance, could significantly shorten production times from a regular and standard perspective, indicating 
significant gains in efficiency. In the primary proposed process, the potential time reserve funds mean a remarkable 
improvement in effectiveness, adding to the general upgrade of the assembling system. Similarly, the operations that 
benefit from the second proposed procedure save even more time, indicating a significant improvement in efficiency 
metrics. Producing footwear looks more efficient and likely saves much time with the proposed changes. These 
processes may position footwear manufacturers as leaders in the footwear manufacturing industry by streamlining 
operations and optimizing workflows. As a result, they open the door to increased output quality, efficiency and 
productivity, establishing the company as a market leader.

Abstract 
The study defines the importance of industry layouts and how an effective layout can significantly improve an 
organization’s efficiency and productivity. With the aid and application of ProModel2018, two proposed layouts are 
designed, simulated, then compared to the original to find the optimal layout to maximize efficiency and minimize 
unnecessary movements and inefficiencies in the production process. The objectives of the study are to properly 
examine the current layout, determine the delays in the process and eliminate them, design and propose an improved 
efficient layout, and to provide recommendations based on the results for further improvements. To achieve this, a 
combination of Time and Motion Study (TMS), and qualitative and quantitative research was utilized in order to 
identify, corroborate, and eliminate inefficiencies through observations and interviews. With the data collected, two 
proposed layouts will be presented alongside the respective data to further corroborate the findings and show how 
each proposed layout compares to the original layout. Further observations also found out that there were far more 
problems present, which includes safety risks and operational risks due to the facility design. The proposed layouts 
were also inadvertently designed to cater to the safety of everyone involved in the line of production. At the end of 
the study a proposed layout will be suggested to be implemented by the organization to fully maximize the efficiency, 
productivity, and effectiveness of the production process of the organization.

1. Introduction
Every company has a strict quota and a direct line of operations that have to be met in order for a smooth operation 
process. This is all the more significant in manufacturing industries that are centered and built around a simple 
foundation of transforming raw materials into finished products. In order to achieve this, the efficiency in creating the 
products should be the primary focus of organizations in this industry. It should take precedence over everything the 
organization has to offer. This is more often the case in manufacturing industries as a more efficient production process 
will certainly equate to a faster rate of production, allowing organizations to reach the desired quota at a greater pace. 
The most significant cause that affects the production and efficiency in the manufacturing industry is the layout. The 
layout dictates the flow of materials during the production process and shows how each product is created to complete

The second proposed layout for the company is displayed in Figure 8 above. The first and second rooms have 
undergone major modifications this time. The first room's modifications included moving a few machines to better fit 
the initial plan that was suggested. The inventory is now situated between the office and the printing machine. This 
action was taken to ensure that the raw materials would not interfere with the signal from the office to the printing 
machine, as they are typically arranged level on the ground. The modification was also made to shorten the distance 
between the inventory and the printing machine. Pressing Machines 2 and 3 were relocated to the first suggested 
layout's location of the inventory. This was done in an effort to minimize the amount of empty space in the work area. 
Additionally, the path from the welding station to the storage space remains unobstructed by this modification. 
Building on that, the storage area in the second room was relocated to the location of the painting area, which had 
been moved to the location of the oven, which had been moved to the location of the storage area in the original 
arrangement. Similar to the first room, these modifications were made to enable employees to travel between stations 
more quickly, which lessens both their burden and the overall distance between each station. For instance, after being 
removed from the oven, the unfinished product must be delivered to the assembly area, which, in contrast to both the 
first and second proposed layouts, was now located directly adjacent to the oven. 
 
6. Conclusion  
To conclude, the paper was able to complete the objectives that were determined at the start. More specifically, with 
in-depth interviews and diligent observations, the proponents were able to find the inefficiencies in the process due to 
the layout of the individual machinery. This also helped to design a proper layout for the company that helped in their

search for the most optimal layout, as well as where the machinery and equipment in the process line should be in 
order to eliminate the existing delays and decrease the mental and physical workload the workers were facing. 
Additionally, the utilization of ProModel 2018 helped to envision the current layout better and helped to show more 
flaws in the layout that could be changed and improved upon. The proposed layouts were created this way, which also 
helped to find the delays in the current layout. This then helped to envision the proposed layout as the proponent based 
on  their findings in the current layout on the proposed layouts. For example,redesigning plant layouts done by Kumar 
et al. (2017) reveals that these can cause significant improvements in process flow and expenses. In addition to that, 
the research by Ahmed and Alkhamis (2018) proves that with the optimum layout, one could establish higher 
production efficiency as well as eliminate the likelihood of delays, which is consistent with the findings that show the 
improvement was 54%. The proposed setup has seen efficiency improve by 2%, as shown in the second layout.

Abstract 
This paper delves into the amalgamation of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices and enforcement of 
German LkSG (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz) environmental regulations in small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) operating within supply chains. Incorporating literature across multiple studies, a majority have 
shown to be vital factors critically affecting the economic, environmental, operational, and GSCM domains. The paper 
has investigated the application of machine learning methods to promote the direction and strength of these factors’ 
influences on one another. The findings are presented in terms of SEM frameworks or models previously employed 
by other researchers that enable easy establishment of correlations as well as feedback loops through CLD 
representation. Such an inclusive approach brings new insight into regulatory adjustment dynamics among SMEs and 
their financial performance. Seven feedback loops explain how GSCM principles interact with regulatory compliance 
to produce financial results. The objective for this study is to enlighten policy makers both locally and internationally 
about this scenario so that they can better enforce policies that will help businesses to operate more sustainably while 
minimizing risks related with non-compliance.

1. Introduction
Unlike many other metamorphoses in Germany that traditionally consume a hefty amount of time to be legislated and 
implemented, the rules regarding the environment preservation are supposed to come to effect immediately and the 
non-abiding parties in supply chains will incur heavy penalties by the governing authorities. According to The 
Economist (The Economist, 2023), from the beginning of the year 2024, German enterprises with more than 1000 
workers are forced by law to put their suppliers across the whole supply network under surveillance, so that they will 
not infract from humanitarian or environmental standards. Otherwise, they will be penalized at least 8.6 million euros. 
Therefore, not only companies across supply chains have the ethical burden of complying with strict environmental 
standards, but also infractions could even jeopardize the financial thriving of the company. Since measures need to be 
immediately taken into action, companies are faced with challenges adjusting their processes with new regulations 
and educating their employees with the amendments they made to their work procedures (Olad et al., 2020). 
Aside from the challenge of making changes in a short period of time, another or perhaps the bigger challenge for the 
SMEs (Small and medium-sized enterprises) is the costs of these changes regarding technology adoption (Radmanesh 
et al., 2021; 2023). Making procedures or technology equipment much more efficient and less energy intensive over 
a short course of time will be challenging for companies, especially those with smaller scales. Since mostly one of the 
cardinal levers for companies in order to remain competitive in the market is keeping the prices to an affordable 
threshold, and by considering the inevitable costs, companies will face serious challenges for remaining on the positive

For the third objective to determine the changing factors with the most negative effect on companies’ revenues and 
the fourth objective for finding the counteracting measures which have the most neutralizing effect on profit-shrinking 
changes, the paper has offered the application of machine learning (ML) methods using real-world data. This will 
enable firstly the verification of the direction of the cause-and-effect and then, analyze the magnitude of the 
correlation. In that case, we will be able to test the most challenging situations and analyze how strong each of the 
challenges and their counter measures are.  
 
In conclusion, this research has investigated the complex and multi-faceted relationship between new environmental 
legislation, namely the German LkSG, and the intrinsic operations of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in 
supply chains. Building on an extensive literature review, a total of 19 critical factors expected have been defined and 
studied to evolve under the auspices of the legislation. By using a combination of structural equation modeling (SEM) 
and distilling a selection of findings into causal loop diagrams, study has enriched the understanding of the associations 
and feedback mechanisms of the relevant factors. The paper has thereby provided a holistic framework for managers 
to navigate the broader implications of environmental regulation for SMEs while attending the operations of their core 
business. This research has brought out a challenge-based view of the factors awaiting significant changes and has 
outlined ways SME operators and decision-makers could minimize or resolve their impacts. The paper has discussed 
the options of securing ISO 14001 certification, deployed green logistics and transportation measures, and proposed 
the most relevant route for adoption in the form of a tool kit. Subsequent to this, the paper has melded all the insights 
into a causal loop diagram, providing a comprehensive view of the causal relationships across multiple scenarios in 
every factor. In terms of future research, the paper proposes integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to delve 
deeper into the financial repercussions for supply chain SMEs. In particular, it is recommended for exerting negative 
influences on profits and the countervailing strategies adopted by SME operators to offset their profit-shrinking 
impacts. By integrating causality, feedback mechanisms and learning models, this research seeks to provide a more 
unified view of environmental regulatory compliance and cost implications. This would be very useful to help more 
informed decisions related to compliance with new regulations while ensuring the survival and sustainability of SMEs 
going forward in fast-evolving business climates. 
 
Future research could use the principles of ISO 14044 to advance understanding of the environmental impact on SMEs 
in the supply chain. By following established life cycle assessment (LCA) methods, researchers can delve deeper into 
the environmental footprint of materials and processes. This allows a comparison between the mitigation strategies 
proposed in this study, leading to a robust decision-making process. Furthermore, incorporating a social perspective 
into broader sustainability strategies in SMEs can enhance their environmental performance when considering socio-
economic factors. Specifically, the benefits of ISO 14044 principles provide a structured framework for LCA, which 
facilitates informed decision-making and facilitates the transition to sustainable business practices in the SMEs’ supply 
chains.

Abstract 
The following study discusses the transformative effects of artificial technology (AI) and its impact on educational 
practice. The study zeros in on the ChatGPT launched on the 30th of November 2022. As the drive to achieve the 4th 
structural development goal (SDG 4), which is striving towards equitable quality education and promoting a lifetime 
of learning opportunities for learners, AI can exponentially increase the chances of attaining this goal. This is because 
it transcends international boundaries which would ensure that marginalized communities have access to its 
personalized learning capabilities. Despite the many potential benefits of AI, it is still in its infancy stage of adoption 
within the educational sector due to limited information on how to effectively adopt it.  This paper aims to develop a 
conceptual framework for the considerations on the adoption of artificial AI in education. The paper adheres to the 
PRISMA Protocol. The databases that were searched are ACM and Google Scholar, ultimately the total number of 
studies that met the final inclusion criteria after screening was 14. The findings reveal that some of the critical factors 
that influence the adoption of ChatGPT are skills and workforce readiness, cultural acceptance, and change 
management. Opportunities derived include enabling personalised learning, enhanced teaching practices, and engaged 
and effective learning. Most barriers identified by the study were academic dishonesty, misuse by educators and 
learners, and limited language options. Furthermore, the application areas outlined by most authors are higher 
education and popular science education. The study is geared at contributing to the pool of knowledge by providing a 
holistic view of AI and considerations to be made when trying to adopt it. This has been achieved by the creation of a 
framework to that effect. This review offers areas of consideration for researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders in 
education to maximize the revolutionary power of AI to reshape the educational landscape and improve learning 
outcomes for all students.

1. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a facet of computer science that makes computers mimic the behavior of humans to 
improve human performance in science and technology (Ghosh and Thirugnanam 2023). AI is a cutting-edge 
technology that impacts almost every field, business, defence, aerospace, or healthcare system. Existing reviews such 
as Dube et al (2024) highlighted that some of the benefits included learning support and concept simplification, but 
their study had the following limitations, the paper was a rapid systematic literature review, meaning it was carried 
out quickly and there is a chance that more and different themes could emerge from the literature. Holmes and Toumi 
(2024) have alluded, that AI can personalize learning experiences, provide real-time feedback, and automate routine

The Role of Fixed Costs in Supply Chains

Abstract 
Fixed costs are a fundamental component in the economy of industrial organizations, which can be a central 
factor to instability, as has been painfully learned during the crises of 2008-9 and COVID-19, but in normal 
times, too. Yet, fixed costs are totally absent in the extensive literature on the subject of pricing in supply chains 
management (SCM). A crucial distinction is the difference between the fixed costs which are referred to in this 
presentation and the ordering/set-up costs in lot sizing models of production-inventory systems. The fixed costs 
considered here are those of break even analyses – the cost which are associated with the establishment and the 
survival of production and service systems: return of capital investment plus financing costs, mortgages or 
rental, insurance, certain taxes, etc. Accordingly, the ordering/set-up costs are, most often, negligible compared 
to the fixed costs. Consequently, not lot or batch sizes of production-inventory models are considered here, but 
the total volume of the activity. The fixed costs may turn a profit to loss and have already done so more than 
once. In addition, the disregard of the fixed costs in the literature on pricing in SCM resulted in a false 
impression that the profit of the supplier, manufacturers in particular, is guaranteed, while in reality it is not. 
Therefore, the fixed costs constitute a critical issue and taking them into consideration is not only significant but 
compulsory. Moreover, the fixed costs add conflicts between members of supply chains. Risks and conflicts 
which are induced by the fixed costs in supply chains are demonstrated and discussed in this presentation. 
Fortunately, there is a solution: partnering by retrospective sharing of the actual outcome. This idea is also 
discussed in the presentation.

Abstract 
Managing waste effectively is very important in industries to save resources and reduce costs.  Traditionally, the 
identification of waste has relied on manual inspection, which is time-consuming, costly, and susceptible to human 
error. This is especially problematic in factories where production lines change often, making manual waste checks 
even more costly. In response to these issues, this paper introduces a novel approach aimed at automating the 
process of waste detection. We propose a structured repository of rules designed to categorize industrial activities 
into eight distinct waste categories. The development and validation of these rules are detailed, and their 
implementation has been tested in the Fischertechnik learning factory environment. Results demonstrate that our 
rule-based system not only achieves high accuracy in identifying waste types but also significantly reduces the time 
and costs associated with waste detection processes. This research represents a progressive step towards the 
automation of waste detection in industrial settings, promising substantial improvements in efficiency and reduction 
in operational costs.

1. Introduction
In the era of Manufacturing 4.0, automation stands as the cornerstone of innovation, reshaping traditional paradigms 
and driving unprecedented efficiency in industrial processes. At the heart of this transformation lies the development 
of highly automated value stream analysis techniques, poised to revolutionize the manufacturing landscape. These 
techniques represent not just a technological advancement, but a critical response to the pressing need for enhanced 
efficiency and productivity in today's competitive markets. 
Waste detection or respectively added value detection is a key activity in value stream analysis. This task mainly 
consists in classifying any resource use into either added value, or non-added value, or necessary non-added value. 
This activity is currently insufficiently automated. Manual waste detection suffers from many challenges that limit 
its efficacy in modern manufacturing environments. From time-intensive procedures to subjective interpretations, 
the limitations of manual processes are increasingly evident, particularly in dynamic production settings 
characterized by rapid changes and evolving demands. Furthermore, the scalability and adaptability of manual 
methods pale in comparison to the evolving complexities of contemporary manufacturing operations. 
In contrast, automated waste detection techniques would offer a paradigm shift in waste management, leveraging 
cutting-edge technologies to navigate the complexities of modern production processes with unprecedented speed 
and accuracy. By harnessing the power of data analytics and machine learning algorithms, automation of wate 
detection not only streamlines waste identification but also mitigates the inherent biases and inconsistencies 
associated with manual approaches. Furthermore, when planning new production lines, the integration of these 
techniques allows for the precise measurement and analysis of added value, non-added value, and necessary non-

for errors, as depicted in Figure 5, where an expert can make approximately 0.06 errors per 100 activities. Despite 
these occasional errors, our automated approach maintains a high level of reliability and consistency. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Error Rate vs. Number of Activities 
 
Based on these results, it can be seen that our approach is significantly more efficient in terms of time is because the 
automated model performs the tasks faster and more consistently Comparison to manual methods by an expert. 
 
7. Conclusion  
The automated detection system for identifying waste in Manufacturing processes, implemented with structured data 
in VSM format, proves to be as a significant advance in the optimization of industrial processes. The precise 
Identification of waste and the optimization measures based on it, supported by visual representations of the results, 
offer an efficient way to Increasing efficiency and productivity in the manufacturing industry. 
 
The direct comparison of our automated solution with manual methods by experts shows significant time savings 
and consistency advantages. While a Experts need about a minute per activity to set the waste rules manuallyour 
system can do this faster and error-free at the same time. This Improving efficiency is crucial, especially in 
environments where time and resources are scarce. 
 
Furthermore, experiments have shown that our automated model is error-free works as long as the data meets the 
required conditions. In contrast to There is always a human risk when carried out manually by experts Failure, even 
if minimal. This highlights reliability and consistency our solution compared to traditional approaches. 
 
Overall, our approach provides an innovative and effective method for dealing with Waste in manufacturing 
processes. By combining automation, with precise data processing and visual representation, companies can do more 
than just their Increase productivity, but also strengthen your competitiveness and reduce costs.

Abstract 
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Peruvian pharmaceutical industry faced significant challenges, such as 
product shortages, lack of medical personnel, and price increases in both public and private establishments. This study 
proposes a supply management model based on Lean Supply Chain Management (LSCM) methodology for small and 
medium-sized pharmaceutical enterprises in Peru, aiming to reduce inventory costs and improve service levels. The 
methodology included data collection and analysis of the current situation of the company, identifying key issues such 
as ineffective purchasing management, inventory management, non-standardized processes, and inadequate 
warehouse distribution. The most notable results of the study show a significant improvement in several key indicators. 
First, the service level increased by 29%, from 61% to 90%. Second, the total cost increased by only 9%, which is a 
controlled increase considering the benefits obtained. Third, profitability increased by 227%, demonstrating a 
substantial improvement in profitability. Finally, the net present value (NPV) of the project was $203,936, and the 
internal rate of return (IRR) reached 80%, suggesting that the implementation of the model is economically viable and 
highly profitable.

Abstract 
This study examines the interrelationships between eco-innovation, knowledge management, government support, 
and operations performance in the Vietnamese aviation industry. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) and 
knowledge-based view (KBV), the researchers surveyed 164 managers from the Ho Chi Minh Cadre Academy and 
Airports Corporation of Vietnam. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), the findings 
reveal that both eco-process innovation and eco-organizational innovation have a direct, positive impact on the 
operations performance. Crucially, the results elucidate the mediating role of knowledge management practices in the 
relationships between green innovation, government support, and organizational performance. Specifically, the data 
analysis indicates that knowledge management mediates the link between eco-innovation and operations performance, 
as well as the association between government support and operations performance. This suggests that organizations 
can strategically leverage their green innovation efforts and government-provided support to develop and apply 
effective knowledge management capabilities, which then translate into enhanced operational outcomes. By 
integrating the RBV and KBV perspectives, this study contributes to the literature by providing a more comprehensive 
understanding of the complex mechanisms through which eco-innovations, facilitated by government initiatives, can

Abstract 
This study aims to explore the factors that impact business performance, specifically focusing on leadership, creativity 
management, environmental compliance, organizational innovation, and government support, in both large companies 
and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Using a quantitative approach, 118 respondents from various 
company sizes were selected through convenience sampling and given questionnaires. Data analysis was conducted 
using PLS-SEM modeling. The findings indicate that Leadership and Organizational Innovation significantly enhance 
Business Performance. Organizational Innovation indirectly boost Business Performance through Government 
Support , which itself greatly promotes Business Performance. Additionally, Oranizational Innovation and 
Environmental Compliance don't mediates the positive relationship between Creativity Managemet and Business 
Performance,  Leadership and Business Performance. While many researchers have investigated factors affecting 
business performance, few empirical studies have examined these specific relationships. This study provides clear 
evidence of the significant roles these factors play in business success.

Abstract 
Online shopping sites, which have been integrated into our lives through the Internet, one of the most important 
inventions in human history, makes people's lives easier and evolving day by day. Therefore, consumers and 
businesses have turned to online shopping sites for convenience and sustainability. The aim of the study was to rank 
some online shopping sites in Türkiye by examining online shopping preferences in a fuzzy environment based on 
Industry 4.0. For this purpose, spherical fuzzy sets and integration with Simple Additive Weighting were used to 
determine the importance weights of the criteria and the ranking of the shopping sites. The results show that the most 
popular shopping website also ranks first in our ranking.

1. Introduction
E-commerce, which forms the basis for online shopping sites, is defined by institutions and organizations from
different perspectives. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), e-
commerce is broadly defined as individuals and organizations conducting commercial activities based on the
transmission of digital data, including text, sound and images (Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development 2011). Online shopping, the most widespread form of e-commerce today, is a part of e-commerce and
is defined as the purchase of products or services by consumers over the Internet without intermediaries (Cavlak 2012).
Online shopping can be defined in its simplest form as shopping on the Internet. Platforms that bring customers and 
sellers together online are called online shopping sites. Unlike traditional shopping, online shopping is beneficial to 
consumers who want to quickly access the products, services and variety they are looking for. Consumer interest in 
online shopping is increasing thanks to the benefits it offers, such as ease of use, 24/7 access, low prices, convenience, 
product variety and time savings (Durmaz and Aksakal, 2023). Considering the fact that the Internet is becoming more 
widely used as technology evolves, competition between online shopping sites will continue to increase in the face of 
rising consumer demand. In this competitive environment, those who follow the development of technology and 
improve their systems by attracting consumers' attention and ensuring its continuity will have an advantage over their 
competitors.  
The process that begins with the new world order created by new technologies is called the fourth stage of 
industrialization, namely Industry 4.0. The simplest definition of this new era, namely Industry 4.0, is defined as the 
""Internet of machines, computers, people and things""(Annunziata 2012). In this context, by using Industry 4.0, 
companies will be able to become competitive by achieving a more reliable and faster working environment, higher

According to the results obtained, the solution based on the criteria and alternatives considered by the experts was 
obtained in a way that reflects the real situation. The most popular shopping website also ranks first in the ranking.  
 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, we proposed a methodology for the selection of online shopping websites based on customer preferences. 
During the evaluation process, the criteria that affect consumers' online shopping preferences were identified among 
the websites that use Industry 4.0 applications. Again, some of the websites using Industry 4.0 were included as 
alternatives in the evaluation process. All these processes were conducted in a fuzzy environment. The reason for 
using fuzzy is that there is a human factor in the selection process and the concept of Industry 4.0 is more effectively 
integrated into the problem. The results obtained with the applied method showed that the result obtained by solving 
the problem was consistent with the results obtained in practice. This shows that the problem was correctly adapted 
and reflects the situation. 
 
In our study, we used SAW's SWGM averaging method. In future studies, the analysis can be performed with the 
arithmetic mean operator, and an approach that compares the results of both operators can also be used. In addition, 
the analysis can be performed using other multi-criteria decision making methods, including those mentioned in the 
literature and in our study. It is also possible to achieve different and better results depending on the area of application, 
based on different criteria and alternatives. In this context, the study also has the potential to be integrated into new 
problems and bring benefits.

Abstract 
Play is the tool that has proven to be the most effective and efficient in learning resources for children They learn to 
forge bonds with others, and negotiate and resolve conflicts in their environment. It is known that there are specialized 
study centers, toys, and other technologies for people with low vision; however, there is still a gap between teachers 
and students in these techniques and tools. A more practical and accessible solution is presented in academic, social, 
and economic issues. The learning block in braille system, which is designed in Autodesk Inventor and printed in 3D 
to make the high relief using PET as printing material, not only in braille system, but also in Arabic, which represent 
numbers, letters and two basic operators of mathematics to obtain complete material and achieve a better inclusion of 
the use of the system. The learning block is also divided into three blocks: basic math operations, word formation, and 
short sentences. The developed system was tested with the help of ten children with low vision at the San Francisco 
de Asis school in Lima, Perú, where we were able to observe the errors and deficiencies of the developed product and 
to enhance it. Finally, this braille block offers an accessible and stimulating way for children with low vision to develop 
math and literacy skills, as this toy provides a unique tactile experience that favors active learning and the integral 
development of children with low vision.

Abstract 
Climate change has generated a growing interest in green technologies and their integration across various economic 
sectors. This has significantly impacted the automotive industry, particularly the rapid bus transit (BRT) system, which 
currently relies on internal combustion engine vehicles, resulting in high greenhouse gas emissions that affect the 
city’s air quality. In response, companies have focused on incorporating electric vehicles into their fleets and assessing 
their impact on route distribution. Due to the expenses associated with purchasing new vehicles and the necessary 
adaptations to parking facilities for potential charging, a gradual transition to a mixed fleet of electric and traditional 
vehicles is being pursued. To address this challenge, the Mixed Fleet Vehicle Scheduling Problem (MFCSP) aims to 
optimize driver assignments and routes, considering operational efficiency and electric vehicle autonomy limitations. 
In this specific study, a modified mathematical model is proposed for the Megabus mass transit system in Pereira, 
Colombia, considering Integra S.A.'s future modernization plans.

Abstract 
This research focuses on the role emerging technologies have in driving changes in procurement and supply chain 
management processes toward better sustainability and redoubtable compliance. Traditional procurement and supply 
chain management strategies undergo dramatic change continually becoming complex with the deep sustainability 
and regulatory compliance at the core of the sourcing landscape. This research delves into how such innovations as 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Product Passports (DPPs) essentially 
revolutionize practice within procurement and supply chain logistics from 1PL to 6PL, along with their implications 
for sustainability and compliance. The research generally used a mixed-method approach, integrating a review of 
literature, analysis of case studies, and analysis of technology. This will provide a conceptual model of how these 
technologies will be incorporated into the supply chain operations presented in such a manner that it will bring quick, 
efficient, and responsive visibility of the activities that take place in the ecosystem of the supply chain in a manner 
that is compatible with global sustainability and regulatory standards. The research points out some of the challenges 
that are inherent in the technologies' development such as integration difficulties, lack of scalability, and strategic 
framework to be used in the implementation. This research will elaborate on the role of technology in driving 
sustainable procurement and supply chain management to give practical guidance to organizations seeking to achieve 
unsurpassed operational excellence while ensuring environmental responsibility and regulatory compliance.

1. Introduction
The quick pace of technological advancement has sharply cut through traditional procurement and supply chain 
management. These functions have evolved into strategic drivers for competitive advantage, encompassing cost 
optimization objectives as well as sustainability goals and regulatory compliance (Radmanesh et al., 2023; Fatahi 
Valilai et al., 2020). In such a complex landscape, there is thus the need for a deeper understanding of these intricate 
connections between technology and procurement and the transformation of supply chains. 
In history, the approach towards logistics strategies was defined by the degree of activities that were outsourced, which 
meant there were providers of services ranging from 1PL (first-party logistics) to 5PL (fifth-party logistics) providers 
(Hesse et al., 2004). However, due to modern technologies and the pace of globalization as well as development within 
the realm of e-commerce, the scope has currently been pushed to 6PL. The above form relatively newer categories 
that point out the growing integration between logistics and sustainable procurement (Govindan et al., 2018). 
Therefore, this paper emphasizes that it is extremely critical to understand the very specific technological changes 
919","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Further to the strategic needs identification and potential technological solution in existence, phase 2 refines the 
appropriate technologies selection process that is parallel to the identified gaps and organizational capabilities. This 
option covers the appraisal and scoring against technological maturity, scalability, and integration potential with 
existing systems. Phase 3 ensures that the technologies intended for implementation have a sound pilot testing and 
this puts the platform from which the technologies may be validated and systematically integrated into the entire setup. 
In this stage, adequate planning has been put in place that includes the intended thorough technical specifications, 
system configurations, and workforce training to ensure comprehensive technology integration. Sufficiently well-
devised approaches taken for implementation need to minimize disruption and usually follow a phased approach 
towards management of complexities entailed in transition. 
 
Phase 4 includes continuous monitoring post-implementation to provide some indicator of performance on the newly 
adopted technologies. In this stage, major key performance indicators (KPIs) are set in line with sustainability, 
efficiency, and compliance. Big data analytics come in for insights into performance trends and identification of areas 
that can be optimized to decide. Phase 5 aims to scale successful technologies across the whole supply chain, based 
on knowledge created in the phases of monitoring and optimization, and infusing a culture for continuous improvement. 
Focus on scale-up strategies to increase the benefits of technological innovations enabling increases toward 
sustainability and compliance. This phase displays and represents TRL 9, a very high operational deployment level of 
technology, with complete operation and continual improvement to meet the needs and difficulties encountered. 
Implementation of continuous improvement mechanisms that are bound to build an adaptive and resilient supply chain 
capable of evolving with war-foot changes in technological advancements and shifting regulatory landscapes are 
considered.

4. Conclusions and Discussions  
In general, this research emphasizes that technological change is pivotal to the transformation in procurement and 
supply chain management with better sustainability and regulatory adherence. It provides an overview of the synergy 
effect through the realization of technology integration, such as Blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), Digital 
Product Passports (DPPs), 3D Printing, Cloud Computing, Robotics, and every other technology in the supply chain 
that imparts the realization of potential services for interactive transparency, efficiency, and resilience of the supply 
system. It furthers the Integrated Technological Framework for the Sustainable Supply Chain Management (ITS-
SCM) Model. This new model will provide a strategy for a blueprint for how to harness the collective development

of such technologies, not only in revolutionizing the supply chain but also ensuring that such critical challenges on 
sustainability can be taken up under very demanding regulatory standards. This is also of importance to organizations 
that are seeking a way through the complex dynamics thrown up by modern-day supply chains: those seeking to 
optimize their operations not only for performance but for being in conformance with environmental protection and 
legal directives. 
 
The study in detail gives a very comprehensive review of the accepted individual and combined impacts of the 
specified technologies on supply chain processes. It will further bring out that digitalization has no bounds in the 
transformation of supply chains and accentuates the need for an all-rounded approach that will leverage the identified 
technological potential to achieve sustainability goals, and operational excellence, and remain compliant with the 
global set of standards. It also defines potential barriers that might prowl true in the adoption of these technologies, 
like problems regarding integration, scalability, and the involvement of regulatory frameworks that support 
innovation. The paper thus offers solutions for some of these barriers and emphasizes the aspect of the creation of a 
culture of collaboration, continual innovation, and improvement. Therefore, it argues for the creation of such an 
ecosystem that will allow smooth adoption and use right across the supply chain of emergent technologies. 
 
Future researchers can extend more research on the integration and interoperability of the supply chain ecosystem 
with emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and Blockchain. This part has identified research that brings to light issues 
in areas that either undermine data sharing, compatibility of systems, and the establishment of workflows over the 
technological basis. The research would aim to devise workable frameworks or guidelines that would enable the 
efficient combination of these technologies to improve supply chain efficiency, transparency, and sustainability. At 
the core of the full realization of how technological advancements avail their benefits in streamlining supply chain 
operations and enhancing collaboration between supply partners, lie herein.

Abstract 
The rapid development of blockchain technology, particularly tokenization, offers new opportunities for financing 
and advancing renewable energy systems. This paper explores how tokenization can serve as a financial instrument 
to facilitate the transition to green energy systems in Germany. Through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, we 
identify a clear trend towards increased research on tokenization, with emerging use cases demonstrating varying 
degrees of applicability. However, in the energy sector, particularly as a financial instrument, a significant research 
gap remains. A finding was that regulatory frameworks and use cases significantly constrain its potential. Furthermore, 
academic literature has yet to develop guidelines and procedures for establishing tokenization as a financial instrument 
and to improve knowledge transfer to implementers. We conducted expert interviews with key stakeholders from the 
banking, sustainable development, digital infrastructure, and energy production sectors to gather qualitative insights 
on the potential impacts and challenges of tokenization. This paper contributes to research on tokenization by 
presenting the current state of tokenization research and highlighting the potential as a financial instrument for green 
energy systems for future research.

Germany faces increasing demand for electricity due to various factors, such as the expansion of electromobility and 
our high demand for electronic communication, including applications of Internet of Things (IoT) (Bermejo et al., 
2021; International Energy Agency, 2023). In consideration of climate change, the German government aims to meet 
this growing demand by accelerating the expansion of renewable energies by 2030. One of the instruments in this 
effort is the Law for onshore wind energy, which sets land area targets for wind energy expansion for each state (Wind-
an-Land-Gesetz, 2022). Despite these efforts, implementers face major challenges due to the lengthy processes 
required from application to the generation of the first kilowatt of electricity by a new green energy system, resulting 
in delayed profits (BWE, 2024). Traditional financial instruments via regional energy cooperatives are reaching their 
limits, struggling with raising necessary capital, managing financial risks, and ensuring timely investment flow, 
undermining their ability to meet the growing investment demand for renewable sources (Cashlink, 2021). 
Tokenization can create new financial instruments to support fundraising and involve small investors through smaller 
share denominations via tokens, potentially reaching a larger number of investors nationwide (Laurent et al., 2018).

Abstract 
Plastic waste is one of the major constituents of environmental pollution due to the increasing applications of plastic 
material in today's economy. Regulation and customer preferences compelled firms to use recycled plastic (RP) for 
sustainable production and a circular economy. Companies have already started using recycled plastic from the market 
in the open-loop supply chain system, but they are facing issues in managing that with the current planning system 
due to unpredictable variations in quality, quantity, lead time, and prices. As a result, their production system is 
affected by shortages, increasing waste, high maintenance costs, and poor product quality, which ultimately results in 
high cost and customer loss for circular businesses. This paper first identifies the sources of these variations in the 
supply of RP to guide industrial experts and practitioners to avoid when transforming businesses from linear to circular 
systems. Ineffective recycling processes, inexperienced recyclers, competition against incineration, and a poor supply 
market are the main problems that make the supply chain more vulnerable. Secondly, a strategic framework is 
developed based on infrastructure design, technology, production planning, product design, supplier integration, and 
customer engagement to guide firms in making their production system and supply chain resilient against the uncertain 
supply of RP in closed-loop supply chain management. 
Keywords 
Closed-loop supply chain, recycled plastic, circular economy, supply-oriented variations, and production decisions. 
1. Introduction
Plastic is a wonderful material due to its properties of being light lightweight, durable, and highly flexible, and has a 
wide range of applications in the automotive, electric, and electronic equipment, and packaging industry (Xometry 
2023). However, due to its polymer properties, long-lasting degradation in air, and insoluble properties, plastic waste 
is producing severe damage to the environment i.e., carbon emissions, landfills, and marine pollution. It is estimated 
that 65% of plastic waste is still not valorized into the circularity and the recycling rate is around 13% higher when 
they are collected separately as compared to mixed collection schemes in Europe (Europe 2022). European Union 
2050 target for achieving a circular economy considers plastic as a priority dimension to control (Yalçın et al. 2024). 
European Union is regulating the plastic industries to use circular plastic at least ten percent (10%) in the process and 
expects to increase the composition up to thirty percent (30%) in 2030 to achieve sustainability goals (Watkins and 
Schweitzer 2018). A treaty was called by the MacArthur Foundation regarding plastic ending up 40% in the 
environment including packaging, and as a result, a resolution was passed in 2022 by the UN Environmental Agency 
to legally binding rules on plastic pollution through a comprehensive circular economy (Ellen-MacArthur-Foundation 
2022). 
Firms have also started working on research and development of efficiently utilizing recycled plastic (RP), and many 
small suppliers have also modified their processes to recycle plastic material from waste collectors. In Europe, it is 
estimated that RP used in the packaging has increased by 43% since 2018 (Europe 2022). However, due to less 
experience, unknown sources of material, lack of technology, ineffective sorting, and inadequate recycling processes,

which is nowadays significant for timely decisions based on supply information and customer engagements e.g., 
Industry 4.0, RFID (Olsen and Tomlin 2019), blockchain (Govindan 2022), digital passport (Jensen et al. 2023), etc. 
The role of information technology is significant in getting updated data from suppliers related to delays, uncertain 
quantities, and the sources of the additives and materials included in the recycling process. It is also important to 
inform the customers through information-sharing technologies about the source of the data, recycling percentages, 
changes in the quality, and delays in deliveries.  
 
Product design 
Now, the EOLP strategy of circular economy is a significant phase of the product life cycle, and product designers are 
advised to incur the remanufacturing attributes during the designing phase to provide a promising business with 
environmental, economic, and social advantages. In the case of recycling, the designer must understand the 
requirements of the recycling operations (Mechanical or Chemical) feasible for their EOLP. The product must be 
designed for the recycling process, the selection of material must consider the easiness of cleaning and separation, and 
the size and shape must be set for a lower cost of transportation. The design of the product depends on the complexity 
of the product structure, size, shape, handling, aesthetics, finishing, etc. (Hallack et al. 2022).  
 
Production planning and control 
The production planning and control strategies include inventory management, quality management, lean operations, 
and process optimization for the management of uncertain supply. The uncertainties in the plastic processing/ 
production system can be avoided by placing an optimal storage buffer of the varieties of the CP in raw material 
inventory with a minimum cost of holding. It will require data on the available material supply and requirements of 
the plastic processing firm. Lean operations include tools and techniques e.g., Kanban, 6 Sigma, 5S, Just in Time, 
Cross training, Quality tools, etc., that seek to reduce different types of waste in the processing (Kurilova-Palisaitiene 
et al. 2018).  
 
Customers’ engagement 
It is also a call for customer engagement to understand specific demand specifications at a granular level, and hereby 
to understand the important constraints and where leeway for variation can be found and accepted. The organizations 
must help the customers understand the changes in the product due to the transition from a linear to a circular supply 
chain of RP.  
 
5. Conclusions 
The research work goes through reviewing the challenges faced by the current plastic firms to manage the RP in the 
supply chain. There are many reasons for these uncontrollable variations from the suppliers’ end and associated 
uncertainties in production, which affect the resilience and performance of the production system. It analyzes how the 
current production system is rigid and incapable of managing the RP consisting of heterogeneous recycling content. 
Mitigation strategies are recommended for the firms to deal with the uncertainties produced by the variations in the 
supply for the consumption of RP without disruption for the successful transition towards the circular economy. It is 
also recommended to transform the supply businesses from an open-loop to a closed-loop system by developing a 
supply chain infrastructure. Transitioning to a circular economy requires a fundamental shift in how firms manage 
production processes and supply chains. By adopting flexible production systems, information technology for sharing 
data with suppliers and customers, product design for recycling, process optimization and flexibility, lean operations, 
and supply infrastructure, firms can better manage the uncertainties associated with heterogeneous recycling content. 
Coupled with innovative business models and supportive regulatory frameworks, these strategies will enable firms to 
mitigate disruptions and achieve a successful transition towards a more sustainable and circular economic model. 
 
The research is based on the literature reviews and the results are significant for decision-makers to transform their 
supply chain from a linear to a circular economy in a closed-loop supply chain of RP. There are future research avenues 
associated with the findings of the work. The variations and associated uncertainties can be identified and ranked for 
the benefit of the firms to consider only significant challenges for further improving the production system. 
Multicriteria decision tools, Pareto fronts, fuzzy systems, and other techniques can be utilized to identify and prioritize 
significant decisions. Systematic data collection using designed questionnaires and conducting interviews with 
industrial experts are required to further extend the application of the work for managing supply-based variations. 
These uncertainties can be converted into measurable risks to provide proactive strategies related to production and 
supply chain to avoid the variations and associated uncertainties using risk management analysis.

Abstract 
In the pharmaceutical industry, interactions between multiple stakeholders under a volatile and ambiguous 
environment, causes a complex task for the supply chain management (SCM). Particularly, several factors impact 
stakeholder behaviors. i.e., climate changes, promotions, prices, product availability, new releases, administrative 
complexity, and regulatory affairs. This complexity leads to uncertainty, causing wastefulness and inefficiency in 
supply chains. Consequently, several effects appear, including not only a reduced companies’ revenue, but also higher 
medicine prices for the population. We use the System Dynamics (SD) approach to model the complex relationships 
between stakeholders in the medicine supply chain considering the effects of real time data collection and inventory 
management as collaborative demand supported by industry 4.0. This model considers Information asymmetries, 
inventory policies, purchasing strategies, minimum order quantities and real time data availability allowing us to 
understand how these attributes affect the supply chain. The model captures system feedback loops to improve their 
performance. e.g., planning, production, distribution, storage, and consumption. By using computational simulations, 
we studied the effects on the pharmaceutical supply chain inventory of managerial policies and public health. These 
simulations also revealed that combining policies from different supply echelons might have a stronger influence on 
capital expenditures. The model shows the importance of using multiple policy combinations through the supply chain 
to improve product availability and reduce unnecessary medicine production and storage. Therefore, logistics 
management will be improved based on timely information available and how better data driven decisions can be 
taken.

Abstract 
The footwear manufacturing sector is crucial for Peru's economy, reflecting both its cultural identity and economic 
significance. However, it faces significant challenges in operational efficiency, such as machine setup deficiencies, 
lack of process standardization, and production quality issues. This study presents a production model based on Lean 
Manufacturing philosophy and the PDCA-Kaizen methodology, aimed at improving operational efficiency in a 
Peruvian footwear company. The model was implemented in four phases: planning, execution, verification, and action, 
with an emphasis on systematic layout planning, work standardization, and the SMED technique to reduce machine 
setup times. The notable results include a 38% improvement in production efficiency, a 39.63% reduction in effort 
measured in Kg-m, a 38.64% decrease in transfer distances, and a 36.74% reduction in unnecessary transfer times. 
These indicators demonstrate that the proposed model successfully addressed critical operational efficiency problems, 
significantly improving the company's productivity and competitiveness in the footwear market. In conclusion, the 
implementation of Lean Manufacturing and PDCA-Kaizen has provided a robust framework for continuous 
improvement and sustainability in footwear manufacturing in Peru.

1. Introduction
The footwear manufacturing sector plays a crucial role globally, in Latin America and specifically in Peru. Globally, 
the footwear industry is a significant sector that not only satisfies a basic need of the population, but also has a 
considerable economic impact. In Latin America, this industry has traditionally been important, with countries like 
Brazil and Argentina standing out as key producers in the region. In Peru, the footwear sector not only contributes to

According to Table 3, initially, the time spent preparing machines was 7 minutes. With the application of the SMED 
tool in the design, it was sought to reduce this time to 4 minutes and 31 seconds, and it was possible to overcome this 
objective, reaching a time of 4 minutes and 29 seconds 
 
5. Results 
Table 4 of results indicates that the five proposed indicators have been successfully achieved through the 
implementation of the PES, Standardized Work and SMED tools. A clear example of this success can be seen in the 
improvements in transfers between areas. The organization and improved flow of materials had a positive impact on 
the indicators of ""Effort"", ""Distance"" and ""Time of unnecessary transfers"". 
 
These changes were also reflected in the rate of progress of the 5S methodology, as well as in cycle times and Set Up.

6. Conclusions 
The developed study focused on the implementation of Lean Manufacturing and SMED methodologies in the footwear 
manufacturing industry in Peru. The main findings indicated that the application of these methodologies achieved a 
significant improvement in production process efficiency, reducing machine setup times and optimizing workflow. 
The plant redistribution through the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) technique reduced distances and transfer times 
between stations, increasing employee productivity. Additionally, the implementation of standardized work and the 
5S methodology improved workplace organization and cleanliness, contributing to a more efficient and motivating 
environment for workers. Quantitatively, production line efficiency improved from 32.6% to 38.4%, surpassing the 
proposed target of 41.4%, and cycle and setup times were significantly reduced. 
 
The research carried out is of utmost importance as it addresses critical operational efficiency issues in a sector relevant 
to the Peruvian economy. Improving production processes not only benefits individual companies by increasing their 
competitiveness but also has a positive impact on the national economy by promoting the creation of quality jobs and 
fostering innovation. The implementation of methodologies such as Lean Manufacturing and SMED provides a 
structured framework for continuous improvement, which is essential to face global market challenges and ensure the 
long-term sustainability of the footwear industry. 
 
The contributions of this study to the field of industrial engineering are significant. First, it demonstrates the 
effectiveness of Lean and SMED methodologies in a specific context of the footwear industry, providing empirical 
evidence that can be used as a reference for future research and applications in other sectors. Additionally, the research

Abstract 
In the world of contemporary automotive engineering, Formula One Student Cars are one of the most fashionable 
vehicles. Scientists from all over the world admire this marvel's immense development. This paper looks into the 
aerodynamic down and drag force’s impact on a Formula One Student Car's front wing while speeding. For the 
investigation, we removed the SD7032 model aerofoil front wing of the Formula One Student Car. We conducted the 
investigation using the numerical analysis method in ANSYS and implemented angles of attack of 0°, -5°, -10°, -15°, 
-20°, -45°, -60°, and -90° in a virtual C15 model, Wind Tunnel, at speeds of 30 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, 40 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, 50 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, 60
𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, 70 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, 80 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, 90 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, 100 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, 110𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1, and 120 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘ℎ−1. The results of generative drag
and down force showed that the Formula One Student Cars can further improve their performance with the use of the
SD7032 model aerofoil with an effective performance improvement.

1. Introduction
Formula One car racing is one of the most popular sports on earth. One of the top events among all motor sports is 
Formula One car racing. The wings of a Formula One racing car are widely considered the most important integral 
aerodynamic component of the car in the world of motor sports. The goal of its creation and engineering was to balance 
the frontal and rear sections of the car's aerodynamics. We specially designed the vehicle's front wing to produce 
significant amounts of downward force. The design also aims to reduce the drag force on the vehicle. It is precisely 
developed and used as a multi-element structure. The fabrication technique is involved in many different parts, such 
as flaps, endplates, cascades, etc. 
Study showed that a poorly designed front wing can significantly increase drag and cause losses throughout the entire 
rear section of the car (Vaidya & Kulkarni, 2017). Maintaining the front wing at the highest quality possible is crucial 
for the development of the racing car's aerodynamic profile. The external air flow around the front wing of a Formula 
One Student racing car is thought to be comparable to air flowing around an aerofoil. For this study, the aerodynamic 
behaviour of a standard aerofoil (SD 7032 Model) is considered because its behaviour can be easily compared with 
the front wings of a racing car, and its geometrical design will help to produce significant downward forces in 
accordance with the specifications. 
In addition, the air velocity at the upper surface of the front wing aerofoil is lower than its bottom surface. As a result, 
the top surface of the aerofoil develops a higher-pressure region in accordance with energy conservation rules. 
Simultaneously, a lower pressure develops to counterbalance the higher kinetic energy at the bottom surface. The 
static pressure difference generates a downward-acting net pressure force.

On the other hand, this SD7032 model aerofoil generates nearly -438.958 N down force with -45°, which is effective 
while speeding, but it can impact in racing. That is why, it is suitable to use while slowing down or braking event. 
Figure 32 shows the chart of lift forces in different angles of attack. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Formula One Student Cars are the most dynamic engineering marvel. The rapid development of this vehicle proves 
that, the world is levitating with incredible engineering beauties. Among all those haptic development of the different 
parts of Formula One car, Front Wings are one of the most crucial to develop any change. Thus, this developments on 
front wings by using SD7032 model Aerofoil can be a key change in the arena of Formula Vehicles. As the 
investigative analysis with results and discussion above shows that, SD7032 model aerofoils for the front wings of 
formula student vehicles can show a generative force results to improve the rapid performance in tracks. It exhibits a 
rapidly increasing amount of down force on 0°, -5°, -10°, -15° and -20° angles of attacks, which is significant while 
controlling and speeding, and yaw angle manoeuvring. On the other hand it shows a good amount of generative lift 
force, which is most important while speeding on the same following angle of attacks. For a clearer investigation on 
the performance of SD7032 model aerofoil, it can also be tested while yaw angle manoeuvring as it implies on racing 
tracks. But, comparing to the traditional NACA aerofoils, SD7032 model shows  similar effectiveness in performance 
and a good aerofoil for implementation.

Abstract 
In knowledge-intensive industries, effective management and sharing of knowledge within maintenance 
departments are critical for operational success. This paper presents an innovative approach to knowledge 
management (KM) and knowledge sharing (KS) by harnessing the untapped potential of novices within 
maintenance departments. In this study, novices were empowered to transition from passive participants to active 
facilitators of KS by undertaking the task of training experienced colleagues, aiming to bridge the gap between 
passive knowledge absorption and active participation. The study also investigates the impact of individual factors 
and organizational factors on KS within maintenance departments of a knowledge-intensive industry, considering 
the moderating effect of ""training by novices."" The study used a questionnaire to assess various dimensions of 
KM and KS, administered to maintenance department personnel. Concurrently, novices played a pivotal role in 
developing extensive training materials over a one-year period, supported by collaborative sessions with seasoned 
experts. The program's impact was evaluated through a combination of closed-ended and open-ended questions, 
exploring participants' experiences and perceptions. Findings revealed a transformation in KM and KS dynamics, 
highlighting the effectiveness of engaging novices as facilitators in driving KS within the maintenance 
department. This study provides empirical insights into the role of novices in enhancing KM and KS practices and 
offers recommendations for organizations seeking to harness the untapped potential of their workforce in driving 
innovation and efficiency. Furthermore, the study proposes a conceptual model that illustrates how training by 
novices moderates the impact of influencing factors on KS within maintenance departments of knowledge-
intensive industries. The study contributes to the evolving discourse on knowledge dynamics within industries, 
advocating for inclusive strategies that harness the diverse expertise of all personnel in driving organizational 
innovation and efficiency.

1. Introduction
In the ever-evolving landscape of knowledge-intensive industries, where knowledge and expertise are central to 
organizational competitiveness, to effectively manage and share knowledge within maintenance departments is 
widely acknowledged. KM is a process that involves creating, generating, capturing, storing, sharing, and using 
knowledge to support and improve individual performance (Ismail and Yusof, 2010). KS stands out as the most 
vital process among all KM initiatives. KS occurs when members of an organization exchange  information, ideas, 
suggestions, and expertise among themselves (Bartol and Srivastava, 2002). The literature underscores the pivotal 
role of KM and KS in fostering innovation, improving operational efficiency, and ensuring adaptability in the face 
of industry dynamism. Organizations are increasingly acknowledging the necessity to transcend conventional 
paradigms, adopting more inclusive strategies to leverage the diverse knowledge resources within their workforce. 
Maintenance stands as one of the pivotal departments within knowledge-intensive industries. Maintenance is 
defined as ""the combination of all of technical, administrative and managerial actions performed during life cycle 
of an item intended to retain it in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform the required function"" (Márquez, 
2007).

Moving forward, future research endeavors could explore the longitudinal effects of novices' involvement in KS 
initiatives, tracking the sustainability of their contributions over time. Furthermore, investigating the role of 
technology in facilitating KS processes, particularly in virtual or remote work environments, presents an avenue 
for further exploration. Additionally, qualitative studies delving into the nuanced experiences and perceptions of 
individuals involved in KS initiatives could provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving 
effective knowledge exchange. 
In conclusion, this research highlights the pivotal role of both culture and intention to share knowledge in shaping 
KS dynamics within maintenance departments. While the findings offer valuable insights into enhancing KM 
practices, future research endeavors should continue to explore and expand upon these foundations to foster a 
deeper understanding of KS processes in diverse organizational contexts.

Abstract 
The Peruvian textile sector, representing 7.2% of the manufacturing GDP and providing approximately 422,000 jobs 
annually, faces significant challenges due to high defect rates and process inefficiencies. This study aimed to develop 
a Lean Manufacturing Model to address these issues by integrating Lean tools such as 5S, Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM), and standardized work processes. The proposed model focused on diagnosing current operational 
inefficiencies, designing strategic solutions, implementing these improvements, and continuously analyzing 
performance to ensure sustainability. The results demonstrated notable improvements, including a reduction in the 
defect rate from 18% to 5%, an increase in 5S audit scores from 65% to 81%, and a decrease in the rework rate from 
20% to 7%. These outcomes highlighted the model's effectiveness in enhancing productivity, quality, and operational 
efficiency, ultimately contributing to the competitiveness of the Peruvian textile industry.

1. Introduction
The textile industry is a crucial economic driver, generating revenue and employment in many developing countries. 
Over the past decade, there has been a notable increase in textile and garment trade among Asian countries. However, 
this trade heavily favors a few countries in East and South Asia. China, including Hong Kong, dominates this trade 
with a 65% share. Other significant contributors are India, South Korea, and Japan, with shares of 7%, 5%, and 4%, 
respectively (Farias Irivarren, 2016). In Peru, the textile sector contributes 7.2% to the GDP of manufacturing 
companies, according to data from the Ministry of Production (Produce, 2019). This sector significantly impacts the 
economy and is vital in creating approximately 422,000 direct jobs annually. Thus, the textile industry is a substantial 
contributor to national economic activity. However, the sector currently faces difficulties, reflected in declining sales

The manufacturing process begins with the delivery of various components: the front, back, collar, and sleeves. 
Initially, the front section is assembled, followed by the construction and attachment of the collar frame. Subsequently, 
the shoulders are joined, the label is attached, and the sleeves are sewn and joined together. To gather data on the 
duration of each activity, a representative sample of 100 data points was used. A confidence level of 95% was 
considered appropriate for analyzing this specific variable (Figure 3 and Table 1).

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of this study demonstrated the effectiveness of implementing the Lean Manufacturing model in the 
Peruvian textile industry. A significant reduction in the defect rate was observed, from 18% to 5%, approaching the 
target of 4%. The 5S audit showed an improvement from 65% to 81%, although it did not reach the 85% goal. The

rework rate notably decreased from 20% to 7%, surpassing the target of 13%. Additionally, improvements in 
operational efficiency and reductions in production cycle times were identified. These results validate the hypothesis 
that integrating Lean tools can solve critical quality and efficiency problems in the textile sector. 
 
The research conducted is of utmost importance as it addresses fundamental issues affecting the competitiveness of 
the Peruvian textile sector. The high defect rate and long production times represent significant challenges that, if 
mitigated, can transform the production and quality dynamics of the sector. This study not only provides empirical 
evidence on the effectiveness of Lean methodologies but also offers a structured framework that can be replicated in 
other industries facing similar issues. The importance lies in the potential improvement of the competitiveness of the 
Peruvian textile sector both locally and internationally. 
 
The contributions to the field of study are substantial. This work not only validates the applicability of Lean 
Manufacturing tools in the textile industry but also offers a detailed and proven model that can serve as a reference 
for future research and practical applications. The integration of methodologies such as 5S, TPM, and standardized 
work demonstrates that even in challenging contexts, significant improvements in quality and productivity can be 
achieved. This study contributes to the existing literature by providing a practical and successful case of Lean 
Manufacturing implementation in an industry traditionally resistant to change. 
 
In the final observations, it is suggested that future studies could focus on the integration of emerging technologies, 
such as automation and Industry 4.0, with Lean tools to further enhance the obtained results. Additionally, a 
longitudinal evaluation is recommended to measure the sustainability of the implemented improvements over time. 
Adapting the proposed model to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the textile sector could also be an area 
of interest, considering the resource limitations they face. This study lays the foundation for a systematic and structured 
approach to continuous improvement in the Peruvian textile industry.

Abstract 
When building simulation models, the objective is to, as closely as possible, mimic the real-world environment. This 
becomes especially important as digital twinning increasingly becomes a business imperative and the benefits of 
analysis become more immediate and tangible.  The model discussed in this paper was developed as a concept of 
capability demonstration, addressing several open points raised by an existing factory simulation effort.   During 
several discussions concerning the modeling of Automated Mobile Robots, a concept of prioritized central dispatching 
control for the AMR’s was developed.  And on that basis, the simulation of information transaction flows much as 
one would simulate the movement of objects in the model.  As with Value Stream Mapping (VSM) information flows 
are as important as material flows in the model.  Finally, as a point of interest, a method is demonstrated here for 
modeling of AMR battery state of charge and recharging based on distance traveled and drive motor effort.

1. Introduction
This paper is the consequence of a series of discussions between the authors about the differences between modeling 
Automated Mobile Robot behavior and actual AMR behavior in the factory with defined paths and central dispatching. 
As a result, the objective of this analysis has been the development of a standard DES simulation model demonstrating 
centralized factory control of the direction of AMR’s.  Development and proof of concept for this general model and 
its embedded code then lay a foundation for application to specific factory case studies.

Initial Scenario 1 
 
 
 
Final Scenario 3 
 
 
Figure 17. Initial state and the final state of the model through the two scenarios. 
 
Comparing “before” state (scenario 1- on left) and “after” state (scenario 3 - on right) we can say that the difference 
in “Busy” time share, between them for Machine001 is 22,0% higher (increase from 80,03 to 97,67), for Machine002 
is 33,4% higher (increase from 72,53 to 96,75) and for Machine003 is 77,6% higher (increase from 51,25 to 91,01). 
The “Blocked” time share dropped to zero for Machine001 and Machine002. For Machine003 it reduced to 6,5%.  
The “Idle” time share also decreased by 83,7% for Machine001 (to 2,33%), by 68,3 for Machine002 (to 3,25%) and 
by 74,2 for Machine003 (to 2,48%).  
 
Ultimately the intent has been to maximize production machine utilization and product output at the expense of AMR 
utilization since the first adds value and the second contributes to overhead costs.  Reducing the time that each machine 
is blocked has the most direct effect on utilization improvement. 
 
5.2 Future Directions and Limitations 
The violet part of the bar chart representing machine “blocked” time indicates the need for an increase in the output 
buffer size for produced parts and increase in the number of AMRs in the model. All three objects need to be addressed.  
The yellow section of the bar chart, showing “idle” time, tells us that the machines aren’t fully loaded, as a result, 
there is a further opportunity for improvement.  
 
Another area for future analysis is the exploration of fully autonomous AMR’s operating as independent swarming 
agents, perhaps employing a “bidding” system to compete for the next available task.  Bidding “points” might be 
based on distance to pick-up location, remaining battery state of charge and other criteria.  Swarming AMR’s with 
simulated R2R communication, (the AMR equivalent of V2V for automobiles) have the possibility of demonstrating 
a hive-like behavior.  Additionally, use of stochastic battery capacity and charge-time models could enhance mirroring 
of the actual factory within the model. 
 
As demonstrated here, DES software such as Witness Horizon and others support embedded code to enhance 
functionality, but this code brings with it the cost of increasing computational intensity.  Finally, increasingly 
sophisticated DES models also become more difficult to validate in all potential cases. 
 
6. Conclusion 
All three factors (number of pallets, buffer size, number of AMRs) play key role in increasing machine utilization.  
Even when it appears that the process is stable and runs smoothly, then comes the reality and fact that AMRs don’t 
run on air! They need to be charged from time to time. Reduced number of available AMRs causes longer pick up 
times. In order to maintain interruption-free continuous production with the highest priority, an increase of output 
buffers was necessary. That caused an increased need for available pallets.  And the addition of pallets is more 
economical than the addition of additional production machines. Theoretically it’s possible to increase the number of 
resources endlessly, but practically, which one of these is the most cost-efficient? That’s a question along with 
continuous induction floor recharging for another research.

Abstract 
The selection and assignment of reviewers to project proposals is a crucial task for funding institutions, ensuring fair 
and accurate evaluations by competent reviewers. However, determining the most qualified reviewers can be 
challenging. This paper introduces a new methodology for calculating a reviewer competency score, derived from a 
weighted combination of the h-index, academic title, and past evaluation performance of reviewers. The methodology 
integrates similarity-based approaches from group decision-making literature with knowledge rules to assess the past 
evaluation performance of reviewers. This approach aims to enhance the reviewer assignment process by ensuring 
proposals are reviewed by highly qualified and experienced experts. An empirical analysis involving 575 reviewers 
and 8808 evaluations from a regional development agency demonstrates the effectiveness of this methodology. 
Adaptable to various evaluation contexts, including academic journals and conference management systems, this 
method provides a robust tool for improving reviewer selection and assignment. Future research will focus on 
developing assignment models that incorporate this competency score calculation to maximize reviewer-proposal 
matching quality.

1. Introduction
The provision of fund or grant support through the evaluation and selection of project proposals is the main task of 
funding institutions. The process involves several complex sub-tasks. It typically begins with the announcement of a 
call for proposals by funding institutions, with details of funding opportunities and requirements. Project proposals 
are submitted to the institutions by researchers, universities, research institutions, etc., who are interested in the topics 
of the call and meet the specified application requirements. Proposals are then screened and assigned to experts who 
are invited to be reviewers. Reviewers evaluate proposals based on their expertise and the criteria established by the 
institutions. The scores are then compiled to help determine which proposals will get funded. In the decision-making 
process of funding institutions, the evaluations of reviewers play a crucial role (Cook et al., 2005). Therefore, the 
selection of appropriate reviewers and their assignment to proposals is one of the most important and challenging tasks 
in the evaluation process (Sun et al., 2007). 
Reviewer assignment is a routine task not only for grant managers but also for conference organizers and journal 
editors. This task typically involves assigning a specific number of experts to review and assess the quality of a project 
proposal or research paper. The assignment must consider both the content of the proposal or paper and the expertise 
of the reviewers. Typically, these assignments are done manually by funding institutions or editors. When there are a 
large number of proposals, this manual process can become very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Additionally, 
the various constraints that need to be considered when assigning reviewers to proposals add to the complexity of the

The methodology for calculating the competency scores that was developed for the project evaluation process of the 
regional development agencies can be easily adapted for use by other funding institutions and research organizations. 
The core idea of evaluating reviewers based on a weighted combination of academic metrics (like the h-index) and 
their past performance can be universally applied to any peer-review system. The methodology is appropriate for a 
wide range of research project proposals across different domains and disciplines, and the flexibility in defining the 
weights for different parameters allows customization to fit specific needs and contexts. Although specifically 
designed for project proposal evaluations, the principles and components are adaptable to other evaluation contexts. 
Given the similarity between the paper selection processes of journals and conferences and the process of evaluating 
project proposals, the proposed methodology can be used to improve the conference management and journal 
reviewing systems. Future studies could explore these applications. 
 
It is believed that the proposed reviewer competency score calculation method can be used to achieve more accurate 
reviewer-proposal matches. By incorporating this methodology into automated reviewer assignment systems, 
institutions can save time and reduce the manual labor involved in the assignment process, while also improving the 
quality of the evaluations. This methodology has the potential to provide a significant contribution to the field by 
offering a robust tool for improving reviewer selection and assignment. 
 
Future studies can focus on developing a mathematical model for the reviewer assignment problem that includes 
objective functions to maximize both the total competency score and the similarity between reviewers and proposals. 
This will further enhance the accuracy and reliability of the reviewer assignment process, leading to better evaluation 
outcomes across various domains.

Abstract 
The sector of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of clothing in Peru faces significant challenges that affect its 
efficiency and competitiveness, such as high production cycle times, delays in transfers due to inefficient plant design, 
lack of standardization of defective processes and products. These problems negatively impact profitability, product 
quality and customer satisfaction, making it imperative to develop improvement strategies. This study implemented 
lean manufacturing tools to address these inefficiencies. Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) and Poka Yoke were 
applied to reorganize the layout of the packaging area and prevent errors in the production process. The 6S 
methodology was used to improve the organization and safety of the work environment, while time and movement 
studies optimized the activities at the workstations. These tools were systematically selected and applied, based on 
rigorous data analysis to identify and mitigate the root causes of inefficiencies. Highlights include a reduction in cycle 
time from 15.5 minutes to 12.1 minutes, representing a 22% decrease. The 6S audit improved significantly, from a 
score of 1.4 to 4.5, an increase of 221%. The distance travelled by the operators was reduced from 738 meters to 470 
meters, reflecting a reduction of 36%. Finally, reprocessing rates decreased significantly; for machine 1, from 15.9% 
to 5.16%, and for machine 2, from 13.3% to 3.57%, indicating improvements of 68% and 73% respectively. These 
improvements not only increased production efficiency and quality, but also increased daily production capacity from 
690 to 895 garments and raised operational efficiency from 68.5% to 88.8%. In conclusion, the study shows that the 
implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools can significantly transform the efficiency of clothing SMEs in Peru, 
providing a clear and replicable methodology that can be adopted in other regions and industrial sectors to improve 
productivity and competitiveness.

1. Introduction
The sector of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) clothing manufacturers plays a crucial role in the global 
economy, in Latin America and specifically in countries such as Peru. These companies represent a significant part of 
the clothing industry, contributing both to job creation and economic development in the regions where they operate 
(Jung, 2023). In the case of Latin America, garment SMEs are often the backbone of the textile industry, providing 
employment opportunities to a large number of people and being an important driver for the local economy (Hossain

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of the study showed that the implementation of Lean Manufacturing, through tools such as 
Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) and Poka Yoke, resulted in significant improvements in the efficiency of the 
manufacturing production line. The layout reorganization, based on the SLP, reduced cycle time from 15.5 minutes to 
12.1 minutes, and travel time from 30.5 minutes to 19.6 minutes. In addition, the reprocessing rate decreased from 
15.9% to 5.16% for machine 1, and from 13.3% to 3.57% for machine 2, evidencing a considerable improvement in 
product quality. These results translate into an increase in daily production capacity from 690 to 895 garments, and an 
increase in production efficiency from 68.5% to 88.8%. 
 
The research carried out is of great importance for the SME clothing sector in Peru and other developing countries, 
where competitiveness and operational efficiency are crucial for economic sustainability. The adoption of lean 
manufacturing practices allows these companies not only to improve their productivity and quality, but also to reduce 
costs and production times. This is especially relevant in a globalized market where rapid and efficient response 
capacity can determine the viability of small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, reducing defects and 
improving the organization of the workplace contribute to a safer and more motivating working environment for 
employees. 
 
Contributions to the field of study include a clear and replicable methodology for process optimization in the garment 
industry, using lean manufacturing tools. This study provides empirical evidence on the benefits of rearranging 
production layout and applying error-proofing techniques such as Poka Yoke. In addition, it provides a framework for 
the implementation of 6S audits, which significantly improve the organization and safety in the work area. The 
research also highlights the importance of a systematic and data-based approach to identifying and mitigating root 
causes of production inefficiencies. 
 
Concluding remarks and suggestions for future studies include the need to explore the application of Industry 4.0 
technologies in combination with Lean Manufacturing, to further enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of 
clothing SMEs. Additional studies could focus on the implementation of real-time monitoring systems for early 
detection of defects and dynamic optimization of production processes. It would also be beneficial to investigate the 
integration of lean techniques with environmental sustainability strategies, to address not only operational efficiency 
but also ecological responsibility in the garment industry.

Abstract 
The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the automotive maintenance service sector are essential for the 
global economy and particularly for Peru. These SMEs face significant challenges related to inefficiency in their 
maintenance processes, often resulting in high levels of unproductive time and inadequate workflow management. 
This study arises from the need to optimize the operational efficiency of these businesses through the implementation 
of planning and continuous improvement methodologies. The main contribution of this research is the development 
and implementation of a service model based on the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle, complemented by Systematic 
Layout Planning (SLP) and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) techniques. This structured model allowed the 
identification and elimination of non-value-added activities, optimization of workshop layout, and improvement of 
workflow efficiency. The most outstanding results of the model implementation include a 30% reduction in distances 
traveled within the workshop, a 15% decrease in service cycle times, a 10% increase in customer satisfaction, and a 
5% improvement in overall operational efficiency. These indicators demonstrate that the proposed model not only 
addressed inefficiency issues but also established a solid foundation for future optimizations, aligning with Lean 
Service principles and ensuring the sustainability of long-term improvements.

1. Introduction
The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the automotive maintenance service industry are essential globally, 
including in Latin America and Peru. These SMEs are crucial components of the automotive ecosystem, providing 
vital services for vehicle owners and making significant contributions to the economy (Nansubuga & Kowalkowski, 
2021). In Latin America, the automotive industry is a key sector for economic development, with SMEs in the

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of the study showed that the implementation of the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) methodology 
and the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle significantly improved operational efficiency in automotive service 
workshops. The initial analysis revealed that the operational efficiency of the studied workshops was 88.5%, 
considerably below the industry standard of 93% (Tripathi et al., 2022). The implementation of SLP and PDCA 
reduced travel times by 30%, resulting in a decrease in cycle time and an increase in overall efficiency. In addition, 
the redesign of the layout and the optimization of the workflow resulted in a reduction of the total service time and an 
improvement in customer satisfaction. These results highlight the importance of a structured and systematic approach 
to addressing inefficiencies in vehicle maintenance processes. 
 
The research conducted is crucial for the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector of automotive 
maintenance, especially in regions such as Latin America, where these companies are vital to the local economy. 
Adopting Lean Service practices and implementing the PDCA cycle not only improve operational efficiency, but also 
increase the competitiveness and sustainability of SMEs. By reducing downtime and optimizing resources, companies 
can deliver better service, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and loyalty. In addition, improved operational 
efficiency contributes to cost savings, allowing SMEs to reinvest in advanced maintenance technologies and practices, 
in line with Industry 4.0 trends. 
 
Contributions to the field of study include the validation of the SLP methodology and the PDCA cycle as effective 
tools for improving operational efficiency in the automotive maintenance sector. This study provides empirical 
evidence on the benefits of a systematic layout reorganization and the implementation of a continuous improvement 
approach. It also highlights the importance of involving all staff in the improvement process, promoting a culture of 
collaboration and commitment. The research also highlights the relevance of using analytical and process mapping 
tools to identify and address the root causes of inefficiencies, facilitating data-driven decision making. 
 
Concluding remarks and suggestions for future studies include the need to explore the integration of digital 
technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), into automotive maintenance 
processes. These technologies can provide real-time data and predictive analytics, further improving operational 
efficiency and enabling more effective preventive maintenance. In addition, future studies could investigate the 
application of these approaches in different contexts and sizes of enterprises, as well as in other service sectors. The

implementation of sustainable and environmentally friendly practices should also be a priority, contributing not only 
to operational efficiency, but also to the social and environmental responsibility of companies.

Abstract 
Low back pain is a widespread issue among individuals engaged in tasks requiring prolonged periods of static 
positioning. This musculoskeletal challenge has seen a surge in prevalence in recent times. The focal point of this study 
is to conceptualize an ergonomic support system specifically geared towards averting lumbar injuries linked to 
sedentary habits. Through a comprehensive experiment involving the analysis of existing ergonomic backrests and the 
subsequent development of a prototype using 3D scanning, design, and manufacturing processes, a solution was 
crafted. A study, incorporating a group of voluntary participants, was executed to assess the efficacy of the newly 
designed lumbar accessory. Findings reveal that the ergonomic product contributes to an increase in the duration of 
maintaining a correct posture, a reduction in pressure on crucial lumbar vertebrae (L4/L5 & L5/S1), and an overall 
enhancement in comfort levels. This innovation holds promise for addressing the escalating challenges associated with 
low back pain in the context of modern sedentary work environments.

5.2 Discussion 
The aim of this study was to design an ergonomic accessory that prevents lower back pain through customization of 
its use. Likewise, a strong relationship was found between the lack of an ergonomic backrest and the generation of 
lower back pain among participants where the pandemic-induced confinement, teleworking, and lack of ergonomic 
tools at home have increased the generation of musculoskeletal problems related to the lower back (Šagát et al. 2020). 
 
According to the results obtained in both working conditions, it can be stated that the use of the backrest increases the 
time that the user maintains a correct sitting posture, that is, with the back supported by the backrest, which can reduce 
lumbar injuries. This may be because users have less room for movement when sitting with an adjustable backrest that 
conforms to their back. 
 
On the other hand, regarding the compression dimensions, it was possible to identify that height is directly related to 
the force applied by participants in their lumbar area. Consequently, if a participant is taller than the others, they will 
apply a greater force to the backrest, which means they will make more movements while seated because they will 
seek to relieve that load. 
 
After the tests carried out with the 3DSSPP software, it can be stated that the design of the backrest allows for a 
decrease in compression of the L4/L5 and L5/S1 vertebrae. This change is attributed to the better distribution of the 
user's back loads on the ergonomic accessory, which can reduce lumbar injuries. 
For the concentration analysis, it was observed that participants performed the assigned task more smoothly without 
resorting to movements associated with back pain to correct their posture once the accessory was implemented. This 
increase in time between both situations may be because when using the ergonomic backrest, the individual is less 
likely to get distracted to adjust their posture in the chair and can focus more on the assigned activity. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
It should be noted that a participant's back scan was used to design the backrest. Consequently, some participants 
needed to position the accessory at different heights due to the difference in height they presented. Furthermore, 
limitations with the number of participants, age gap between participants and gender of the participants may yield 
different results that could further enhance the current findings. To improve the backrest, adjustable components could 
be added to accommodate various body types and sizes. Implementing advanced scanning technology for a more 
accurate 3D model of the user's back would enhance customization. Incorporating smart technology with embedded 
sensors could provide real-time feedback on posture, helping users maintain optimal ergonomic support. Data from 
these sensors could guide further design improvements. Exploring new materials like memory foam or gel inserts could 
enhance comfort and durability. Using breathable, washable fabrics would improve hygiene and comfort. 
 
The current study showed reduced discomfort and vertebrae pressure, and increased concentration with the backrest. 
Future studies should test the backrest in real-world office settings over extended periods to gather insights on long-
term benefits and areas for improvement. 
 
6. Conclusion 
According to the reviewed literature, one of the main factors that leads to lumbar injuries is due to poor sitting posture 
for an extended period. That's why the increase in time a user spends sitting correctly, facilitated by the implementation 
and use of an ergonomic backrest observed during the experimentation of this accessory, can reduce the occurrence of 
lumbar injuries. 
 
Lumbar injuries were identified as predominant in workers who perform tasks in a static posture at a workstation. This 
type of pain is due to compression of the L4/L5 and L5/S1 vertebrae caused by sitting in the same posture for hours. 
Therefore, the pressure of this posture was reduced by better distributing the participants' load when using the 
ergonomic backrest and supporting themselves correctly. 
 
Likewise, through the statistical tests of this study, it was determined that participants were able to maintain 
concentration for longer periods while performing their tasks. Additionally, it was observed that all participants were 
constantly moving due to the discomfort caused by the seat without the ergonomic accessory, this problem was 
significantly reduced upon implementing the backrest and observing that participants moved less frequently, 
maintained a correct posture for a longer period, and were more focused on performing the task.

On the other hand, the development of the pushing mechanism through the pistons was essential for participants to be 
able to configure the accessory and thus improve their experience by choosing the ideal position for their back. 
Similarly, to produce the backrest industrially, manufacturing with plastic through injection is proposed to reduce costs 
and improve the flexibility of the accessory. Similarly, it is recommended that the backrest includes additional elements 
that can enhance the comfort and experience of the participants during testing, such as the use of foam, cotton, and 
covering it with fabric or leather. 
 
The idea of manufacturing the ergonomic backrest in two different ways is being considered. Firstly, an anthropometric 
table can be used to allow a larger portion of the population to use the accessory. On the other hand, it is possible to 
continue with the method used in the present study, which involved scanning a participant to create the backrest, 
making it a customized product tailored to each user's back.

Abstract 
The brewing industry, especially within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), plays a pivotal role in economic 
development and cultural preservation. This study emerged from the need to address production inefficiencies and 
quality issues in the craft brewing sector. The proposed contribution involved the implementation of the PDCA 
methodology, incorporating Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED), and 
Andon tools, to enhance operational efficiency and product quality. The study aimed to reduce waste, optimize 
production time, and improve overall efficiency. The results demonstrated significant improvements in key 
performance indicators. The setup time decreased from 41 minutes to 29 minutes, reflecting a 29% reduction. The 
downtime of the process was reduced from 74 minutes to 22.75 minutes, a substantial 69% decrease. Additionally, 
the rate of defective products dropped from 2.97% to 1.30%, marking a 56% improvement. These outcomes highlight 
the effectiveness of the implemented methodologies in resolving the identified inefficiencies and enhancing the 
production process. The findings underscore the potential for SMEs in the craft brewing industry to achieve sustainable 
growth and competitive advantage through continuous improvement practices and advanced manufacturing 
techniques.

6. Conclusions 
The study conducted on the beer production process revealed several significant findings. The implementation of Lean 
Manufacturing tools, including SMED, TPM, and Andon, resulted in a remarkable improvement in key performance 
indicators. The setup time was reduced from 41 minutes to 29 minutes, marking a 29% decrease. The downtime of 
the process saw an even more substantial reduction, from 74 minutes to 22.75 minutes, translating to a 69% decrease. 
Additionally, the rate of defective products was significantly lowered from 2.97% to 1.30%, indicating a 56% 
reduction. These improvements demonstrate the effectiveness of the applied methodologies in enhancing operational 
efficiency and product quality within the brewery. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its potential to address common inefficiencies in small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) within the brewing industry. By systematically identifying and addressing the root causes of 
production inefficiencies, this study provides a replicable model for other SMEs facing similar challenges. The 
reduction in setup time, process downtime, and defect rates not only improves productivity but also enhances the 
overall sustainability and competitiveness of the enterprise. This research underscores the critical role of adopting 
structured continuous improvement methodologies to achieve operational excellence in the brewing sector. 
 
This study contributes to the field of industrial engineering by demonstrating the practical application of Lean 
Manufacturing tools in a real-world setting. The integration of SMED, TPM, and Andon methodologies showcases 
their combined effectiveness in streamlining production processes, reducing waste, and improving quality control. 
The findings highlight the versatility of these tools in various industrial contexts, beyond the brewing industry, making 
them valuable for broader applications in manufacturing. This research also adds to the growing body of literature 
supporting the implementation of Lean practices as a strategic approach to operational improvement in SMEs. 
 
In conclusion, the successful application of Lean Manufacturing tools in this case study provides valuable insights 
into improving efficiency and quality in the beer production process. The significant reductions in setup time, process 
downtime, and defect rates reflect the potential benefits of such methodologies for SMEs. Future research should 
explore the long-term sustainability of these improvements and investigate additional Lean tools that could further 
enhance production processes. Additionally, studies could focus on the integration of advanced technologies, such as 
Industry 4.0, to support continuous improvement efforts and further drive operational excellence in the brewing 
industry.

Abstract 
This paper describes the use of Tecnomatix in the final year project to simulate a manufacturing facility that 
manufactures footballs. Various literature have shown how Tecnomatix plant simulation have been used in different 
fields of the manufacturing industry and proven itself useful in all stages of manufacturing. The simulation created 
has revealed several bottlenecks like long waiting times at the assembly station and long blockage times at several 
stations ranging between 10% and 70%.  The use of simulation software can help in analysing the system and 
improving it through adjusting working times, amount of resources, or even conveyor speeds

1. Introduction
Siemens' Tecnomatix PLM (Product Lifetime Management) is a full-featured software suite created to optimize and 
streamline the whole product lifetime, from design and conception to production and upkeep. Tecnomatix PLM is a 
leading solution in the area that provides a variety of tools and functions to improve productivity, creativity, and 
cooperation in a variety of sectors (Plant Simulation Foundation). 
Tecnomatix simulates production and logistics operations. Siderska, J. (2016) defined the Tecnomatix program as 
allowing the simulation of discrete events, the creation of digital models of logistical systems (such as production), 
and the optimization of the operation of production plants and production lines, in addition to individual logistics 
operations. The article also included applications for simulating factories for modelling processes in production 
engineering and logistics services, and some selected examples of simulation processes were presented (Siderska 
2016). 
All things considered, Siemens' Tecnomatix is a complete digital manufacturing solution that gives organisations the 
ability to innovate, optimize, and succeed in the competitive market of today. Tecnomatix was used in this project to 
simulate a manufacturing facility that produces footballs.

4.3 Proposed Improvements 
After observing the above results, we can propose the following improvements: 
Waiting time reduction by improving the material flow to avoid the assembly, testing and packaging stations from 
idling. Material flow improvement can occur by decreasing the blockage in the predecessor stations of the assembly 
stations. These improvements can be reduced by either increasing the number of resources working on each station, 
increasing the arrival time of the MUs from the source or decreasing the working time. 
 
4.4 Validation 
The simulation model was built with the initial assumption of having one worker for each station. This model had 9 
stations which meant 9 workers were needed according to the initial hypothesis. The hypothesis in this paper checked 
if we can decrease the number of workers and maintain the same level of throughput and not affect the productivity 
of the production line. By observing the graphical and numerical results, we can state that decreasing the number of 
workers from 9 to 6 workers and having workers share the stations when needed, will maintain the same level of 
throughput. However further studies can be conducted to study the efficiency of the production line when decreasing 
the number of workers, and its effect on their health and safety 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the simulation contributed greatly to our perception of manufacturing, recognizing areas of modification 
and elements to be centred on. The way to go with issues such as long queues and turnarounds is to automate the flow 
of work and increase efficiency. Through the analytical data and the inspection, we can use multiple paths for a more 
efficient flow of the process and a more efficient use of assets. Periodical evaluation of the manufacturing process and 
the implementation of continuous modernization are key factors in getting a full advantage from it by producing high-
quality products as originally set. Observing literature that used Tecnomatix for testing production lines or 
manufacturing facilities, revealed the significant use of simulation as an Industry 4.0 solution. 
Our work on Tecnomatix was a significant contributor to the design of our manufacturing facility. The model built 
helped us grasp a better understanding of the material flow, worker flow, and resource statistics. By adjusting different 
parameters in the model we were able to identify the effect between the number of workers and the throughput. More 
studies can be carried out on our model in the future to increase productivity and efficiency showing the prominence 
of simulation tools in the manufacturing industry (Figure 17- Figure 18).

Abstract 
Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) are key architectural components for several modern digital systems. 
Publish-subscribe (pub/sub) is an established messaging pattern for (I)IoT. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport 
(MQTT) is a popular pub/sub-based messaging protocols for (I)IoT. Unfortunately, MQTT insufficiently supports 
Real-Time (RT) requirements. A computer system is a RT system, when the correctness of its behavior depends not 
only on the logical results of the computations but also on the physical time when these results are produced. In this 
work, we propose a minimally intrusive extension to the MQTT protocol in order to render MQTT RT capable. We 
first define a fourth new time-based Quality of Service (QoS) level for MQTT by using special messages and 
additional minimal functionalities at the client and broker sides. This QoS level allows publishers and subscribers to 
negotiate how many messages (m out of n) must be delivered in time. A scheduler on the broker processes received 
messages depending on (a) agreed message ratio m-out-of-n, (b) the residual lifetime of messages, i.e., time to deadline 
till desired delivery to destination, and (c) the expected round trip time to the destination. The “m out of n” principle 
allows to address the various RT classes such as soft-, firm- and hard-RT. In addition, this approach allows to trade-
off the system efficiency and the achievable RT class. First simulations confirm that the proposed approach converges 
to a reasonable message drop-off level without endangering the agreed m-out-of-n messaging ratio, i.e., the targeted 
RT class.

Abstract 
This study examines used product recovery and production strategies in a closed-loop supply chain under two 
environmental regulations: emissions taxes and waste management policy. The closed-loop supply chain consists of 
an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and a Third-Party Remanufacturer (TPR). The OEM produces and sells 
new products and is responsible for the end-of-life phase of these products. Due to his inability to properly dispose of 
used products, the OEM either pays waste management taxes or outsources used product disposal to the TPR. The 
TPR recoveries used products by remanufacturing or recovering materials. Additionally, she may decide to produce 
her own-brand new products using recovered materials. The TPR sells both remanufactured and new products in the 
same market as the OEM, thus resulting in potential market cannibalization between two firms. Market cannibalization 
likely prevents the OEM from outsourcing disposal to the TPR and reduces the TPR’s willingness to remanufacture 
used products as well as producing new products. At last, two firms need to pay emissions taxes for pollutants released 
during production, remanufacturing, and materials recovery. To examine the OEM’s disposal outsourcing strategies 
and the TPR’s recovery and new product production strategies, we consider three scenarios: no disposal outsourcing, 
disposal outsourcing without TPR’s new product production, and disposal outsourcing with TPR’s new product 
production. Our results reveal the TPR’s disposal and new product production strategies as well as the OEM’s 
outsourcing strategies coupled with the corresponding conditions. Additionally, per the results, a low emission tax or 
an extreme high (or low) collection cost discourages the TPR from remanufacturing, whilst a high waste management 
tax incentivizes the OEM to outsource disposal. Interestingly, despite the competition between two firms’ new 
products, the introduction of the TPR’s new product can induce the OEM to outsource disposal to the TPR.

Abstract 
Digital twins of manufacturing systems have become increasingly relevant for use cases such as virtual commissioning 
and AI related process optimizations such as predictive maintenance or condition monitoring. However, the lack of 
standardization with regard to implementation tools and the ambiguous use of the term prevent digital twins from 
widespread industrial application of digital twins. This paper presents a conceptual approach and a successful 
implementation guide for a digital twin of a modular manufacturing system. First, different notions of the term digital 
twin from the vast literature are summarized and a unifying definition is presented. Turning to the application example, 
the modular design of the manufacturing system considered in this paper is outlined as well as the workflow of the 
industrial assembly process. In the main section a detailed architectural concept for a digital twin of manufacturing 
systems is presented. Finally, the toolchain that implements this architecture is described emphasizing the 
functionalities of the components used. The results are discussed and an outlook towards a bidirectionally 
interdependent digital twin is given.

1. Introduction
In order to meet the increasingly complex requirements of modern manufacturing processes, new transformative 
concepts are needed, such as the digital twin. Digital twins are often not clearly defined and therefore offer a wide 
range of applications. Whether for virtual commissioning, AI applications such as preventive maintenance or 
development purposes, digital twins can support decision-making, operational control tasks and design decisions. In 
order to fully unlock this potential, the individual use case must be correctly identified and the digital twin correctly 
defined according to the requirements. The appropriated choice of a software toolchain that connects real and virtual 
entities is also essential for correct implementation.  
As a future technology the digital twin serves as a bridge between the physical and digital realms, enabling 
manufacturers to gain unprecedented insights into their operations. With this knowledge, processes can be adapted 
and optimized accordingly towards more growth, resilience and sustainability. Using suitable software solutions, 
digital twins can be set up as closely as possible to the real counterparts and processes. This allows software solutions 
of varying complexity to be selected depending on the level of detail required. For example, entire processes can be 
simulated in real time. Dynamic in-loop adjustments in the manufacturing process can be adapted to be able to react 
appropriately to exceptions or to simply minimize downtimes (International Organization for Standardization, 2016). 
Dynamic in-loop adjustments can be made to the manufacturing process in order to react quickly and appropriately to 
exceptions or irregularities and thus avoid bottlenecks. Processes can also be tested in advance and different scenarios 
compared with each other in order to design a process as optimally as possible. This allows manufacturing deadlines 
to be met dynamically. Processes can also be tracked and visualized through the utilization of digital twins. This means 
that parts and components can also be traced. This is particularly advantageous in downstream processes.

The RAMI definition of the digital twin can now be fully described based on the hardware and software composition 
used. This figure can now also be used to categorize the entire system, which was set. On the one hand, the information 
flow is unidirectionally automated, as the information flow from the real system only takes place to the virtual one. 
This is because only the iiwa controller sends data to the digital system. Furthermore, it is a virtual commissioning, as 
the twin maps the processes of the real system in a virtual environment (the Siemens NX MCD). Also, the twin is 
used exclusively for process automation. This means that the dimensioning of the RAMI model is now clear and can 
be classified in accordance with chapter 2. 
 
5. Results and Discussion  
The main result of this work is that a unidirectionally automated digital twin has been implemented for virtual 
commissioning in process automation. The twin was created by applying a generally viable architecture model, from 
which corresponding requirements could be derived, which in turn enabled the creation of a possible toolchain for 
implementation. At the same time, it shows how the data from the individual simulation levels must be coupled with 
each other in order to create a suitable tool chain. For the specific use case for which this was carried out, it can be 
stated that the digital twin was created using only the KUKA iiwa controller as a real component. The digital twin 
combines the necessary automation functions in a realistic PLC environment with realistic robot emulations, both of 
which are visualized in a real-time capable process simulation. In accordance with the simulation profile the 
implemented digital twin enables low latency with realistic behavior and movements, with a negligible offset between 
the system behavior of the physical and virtual system. Based on this elaboration, real processes can be virtually 
simulated and thus essential data can be recorded and visualized in advance. Important key performance indicators 
such as process times or capacity utilization can be determined under realistic conditions and evaluated accordingly. 
This allows a manufacturing process to be optimally preconfigured. In particular, the combination with the modular 
manufacturing cells enables a fluid manufacturing system. Here, the modules of the manufacturing system can be 
reconfigured in short intervals. The digital twin presented enables swift virtual commissioning in this type of dynamic 
production environment. 
 
6. Conclusion and future Work  
Further improvements can be made in regard to complete software-in-the-loop emulation. For instance, the KUKA 
iiwa controller is yet to be replaced by a suitable emulation, or if not available by a physical Simulation. A suitable 
interface must also be configured for the simulation or emulation and implemented into the toolchain. Moreover the 
MES system currently running on another computer can be transferred to the host computer of the digital twin. This 
would enable centralized control and management of the entire system and the twin. Completing these steps achieves 
a digital twin further towards bidirectional coupling and a corresponding extension of the RAMI definition. A closed 
loop control communication between the virtual model data, services and the physical entities is possible by 
implementing intelligent interconnections (Zhang et al., 2022). This can provide the basis for further research on the 
existing digital twin and the introduction of corresponding data mining algorithms. As a result, the digital twin can be 
expanded to include an edge connection, which offers many new possibilities and is a prerequisite for linking the 
digital twin with IoT technologies (Li et al., 2022). Consequently, the digital twin can also be designed smarter in the 
future, whereby, for example, it can also make decisions itself by means of an agent system and thus carry out orders 
autonomously. As a result, it can increasingly become essential for future manufacturing, as described by Kagermann 
at the beginning, and support the megatrends of manufacturing already mentioned.

Abstract 
The craft beer industry has developed in the Peruvian market by 2023, representing sales of 2.33 billion; However, its 
productivity rate of 12% is still low compared to the industry's average productivity of 55%. Among the causes of the 
problem, the lack of a production plan and a demand forecasting system was identified; Therefore, the objective of 
this study is to develop a forecast model for the demand for beer and the economic order quantity of raw materials to 
develop an adequate production and supply plan to increase productivity in the study company. The Winters demand 
forecast model was selected by analyzing the mean absolute percentage forecast error (MAPE) indicator of 9.4%, 
assuming +/- 10% MAPE as a limit and the similarity of the model's behavior with respect to the historical demand 
of the company. The proposed model was validated through simulations using software in Excel and @Risk. The 
research has shown a 48% increase in productivity compared to the initial value, achieving an increase of 3,905,656 
PEN in the income of the craft beer company investigated.

1. Introduction
In recent years, beer consumption has represented approximately 75% of the most consumed alcoholic beverages in 
the world according to Deloitte (Almaraz, 2022). In Latin America, total sales amount to 32 million liters, with a 
projection of 41 million liters by 2025.  Thus, 1.34 million liters of beer are sold annually in Peru today. As the beer 
market has grown, other alternative business options have been created: small craft beer manufacturing companies, 
which have taken possession of 0.3% of the Peruvian market. Currently, it is possible to identify several problems that 
craft producers must face in the face of an already developed market such as the commercial beer market. One of the 
main challenges, as evidenced in the study conducted by (Quispe and Quintanilla, 2018), is the delay in the supply 
and importation of raw materials such as malt, necessary to produce craft beer. Thus, the importance of a structured 
production plan that considers sales and market demand is evident, so that the import of raw materials can be managed 
taking into consideration the lead time and possible delays in t Precisely, in the analyzed company a low productivity 
has been observed in the production process of craft beer, finding levels of 12% with respect to 55% of average 
productivity of the sector; in view of which, as a contribution, the research proposes a management model to improve

The result was a total of 141 thousand liters of finished product, which generates an economic impact of 3,905,656 
PEN in unsatisfied demand. Likewise, with the new beer production projections there is a recovery of the productivity 
indicator to 59% annually, 48 percentage points above the current value (Table 8) 
 
6. Conclusion 
The main objective of the research developed is to propose a management model for increasing productivity using 
demand forecasting tools and the calculation of the economic order lot. Thus, it is concluded that it is feasible to use 
both tools to increase productivity by 48% compared to the initial value, which translates into an increase of 3,905,656 
PEN in the income of the craft beer company investigated. This impact on the analyzed indicators is achieved by 
applying a system that integrates both demand prediction to avoid stockouts of finished products and the development 
of a production plan based on the calculation of the batch of input that could present the greatest problems. have a 
high lead time when imported: the bottles.  
 
Regarding the demand projection, the MAPE indicator was taken as a reference to measure the variation between the 
forecast and actual demand, and thus be able to choose the type of forecast that best suited the market: Winters method. 
In addition, the parameters that should be used for the tool to continue working in the future were defined. While the 
technique provides an estimated number of liters of beer to produce, the production capacity needed to make this 
happen must be considered. In the present case, the company has a capacity of 24 thousand liters per month, and the 
Winters model indicates that 11 thousand liters should be produced per month on average, so it would be feasible to 
apply this tool in the company. Likewise, the EOQ made it possible to correctly define the replacement of the chosen 
raw material to ensure the production of the plan. Carrying out the simulation, a quantity of 5,588 bottles was obtained 
as the ideal economic order lot and a safety stock of 722 units to ensure the company's supply. It must be evaluated 
whether it is feasible to store the indicated number of bottles, otherwise create new spaces for it if desired.  
 
Finally, the results obtained based on the model demonstrate significant improvements both economically and in the 
standardization of the purchasing process. It is important to mention that the study was developed during a pandemic 
period, therefore certain information and periods of data were excluded due to atypical results that could have a 
significant change in results. It was assumed as a regular market and context as year prior to 2020. Future 
investigations may develop a plan of solutions for the other main problems such as Master Production Schedule once 
the forecast and MRP processes are solid. Other areas of development for companies in this market may go on lean 
manufacturing once the correct planning in production lines is made to keep improving the productivity. Finally, we 
also encourage research into the 5S methodology, that focuses on reducing waste and optimizing the productivity in 
the work area.

Abstract 
Product profiles can be used to model product needs in the early phases of product engineering and describe the 
product in a way that is open to solutions. Continuous and early validation of these product profiles is crucial in the 
product engineering process. This allows for the early identification of errors, which can then be addressed through 
cost-effective changes. While the literature discusses various challenges of early validation related to the 
characteristics of the early phase of product engineering, there is limited focus on continuous validation. In this 
publication, challenges for the continuous validation of product profiles were derived from existing literature. In 
summary, nine challenges were identified and subsequently linked to the characteristics of the early phase, resulting 
in the identification of four fields of action for continuous and early validation of product profiles.

Innovation, Continuous and Early Validation, Needs and Benefits, Product Engineering, Challenges, Field of Actions 
1. Motivation
Unique selling propositions and competitive advantages are crucial for the success of companies. Especially in times 
of change, innovations are necessary to guarantee these competitive advantages and ensure the economic success of 
companies (Ogrean, 2018). Retrospective analyses of failed products in the market, such as the Amazon Fire Phone 
or the Microsoft Zune, illustrate this. The failure of the Amazon Fire Phone can be attributed, among other reasons, 
to its lack of differentiation through its features. While the iPhone convinced users with its revolutionary user 
experience and extensive app ecosystem, the Fire Phone offered innovative but ultimately unhelpful features such as 
Dynamic Perspective and Firefly, which did not provide lasting value to users. This lack of differentiation compared 
to established smartphones meant that the Fire Phone could not make a significant impression in an already saturated 
market. (Luckerson, 2014) The failure of the Microsoft Zune in comparison to the iPod can be attributed to several 
factors: late market entry, limited ecosystem, ineffective marketing, inferior design and user experience, and lack of 
network effects. Specifically, in the areas of design and user experience, the Zune could not compete. While the iPod 
was distinguished by its elegant design and intuitive user interface, the Zune offered a less appealing design and a less 
refined user experience. This made the Zune less attractive to users who were already accustomed to the high quality 
and user-friendliness of the iPod. (Fuss, 2019) These products are therefore inventions that did not become innovations 
because the requirements or needs were not valid. 
2. State of the Art
There are many definitions of innovation in the literature. Hauschildt, Salomo, Kock, and Schultz (2016) categorise 
various definitions of innovation by individual authors into a total of seven categories. Among other things, innovation 
1134","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
action Enabling Interpretation of Early and Continuous Validation of Product Profiles Results describes the 
opportunity for supporting developers with the next steps after the validation by proposing action before and after the 
validation activities are performed. This is exacerbated in the early phase by unstructured processes, unclear 
responsibilities, and high uncertainty. Unstructured processes intensify the issue that drawing conclusions for the 
product based on interpreted validation results is challenging. It is not clearly defined as a process what the results 
mean for the product. Additionally, uncertainties complicate the traceability, as there can be situations where the 
validation activities become obsolete because the product has been further developed. 
 
These field of actions can be utilized to develop future methods, processes, and tools for the early and continuous 
validation of product profiles by defining each field of action as a success factor. 
 
6. Conclusion and Outlook 
In summary, the three research questions addressed in this publication have been answered. Regarding the first 
research question, a total of nine challenges in the continuous validation of product profiles were identified and 
described. These were utilized to address the second research question by connecting the identified challenges with 
those of the early phase from the literature. The influences on how the challenges of continuous validation are 
amplified were described. Based on this connection, four action fields for the continuous and early validation of 
product profiles were subsequently described. These action fields serve as starting points for the development of new 
methods, processes, and tools for continuous and early validation of product profiles. By answering the research 
questions, the research objective of this publication was achieved by deriving action fields for continuous and early 
validation of product profiles. However, there are further open points that need to be addressed in future research 
activities. Firstly, the challenges and action fields need to be evaluated and new ones need to be added from an industry 
perspective to obtain a valid starting point. Surveys and interviews can be conducted for the evaluation of the identified 
challenges as well as of the action fields and for the addition of new challenges or field of actions. This can help to 
further specify the descriptions of the action fields. Secondly, based on the action fields, goals, requirements, and 
constraints for methods, processes, and tools can be derived. Following the DRM - Design Research Methodology by 
Blessing and Chakrabarti (2009), these can be defined for application, support, and success. Furthermore, these goals, 
requirements, and constraints can be further specified through a practical view of the action fields.

Abstract 
The shared economy, originally based on communal resource sharing, evolved with digital platforms like Airbnb and 
Uber. While commercially successful, these models often overlook sustainability. This study demonstrates how 
blockchain technology can enhance sustainability in shared economies while boosting financial profit. Using 
Ethereum Smart Contracts for shared last-mile delivery, the system was developed and tested on Remix IDE. The 
smart contract's functionality, including order management and cost analysis, showed it to be more cost-effective than 
traditional methods, reducing travel distance by 21.7%. Hashgraph technology is also explored for potential cost 
reductions. Security analysis is conducted using Remix IDE plugins as well as third party security analysis tools. By 
facilitating shared deliveries, the platform reduces isolated deliveries and carbon emissions, contributing to 
sustainability. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge and lays the groundwork for future blockchain 
applications in shared economies and last-mile delivery.

1. Introduction
The shared economy, also known as the sharing economy or collaborative consumption, has a rich history rooted in the 
age-old practice of communal resource sharing. However, its contemporary form began to take shape in the late 20th 
century with the emergence of early predecessors like carpooling and time banking. These early examples showcased 
the potential of collective resource utilization and community-based sharing. The true catalyst for the shared 
economy's exponential growth, however, was the digital revolution of the early 21st century. With the widespread 
adoption of the internet and smartphones, online platforms and mobile apps became instrumental in connecting 
individuals with underutilized assets. Airbnb and Uber, launched in 2008 and 2009, respectively, revolutionized the 
accommodation and transportation sectors  (Polisetty Aruna, 2021), (Abdar Moloud, 2020), (Guo Longhua, 2018), 
(Tseng Yung-Ching, 2021) . Airbnb allowed people to share their homes with travellers, while Uber introduced 
ridesharing as a convenient alternative to traditional taxis. These successes paved the way for a multitude of peer-to-
peer marketplaces, enabling people to share various resources, from tools and clothing to skills and expertise. Yet, as 
the shared economy continued to flourish, it also confronted challenges, including regulatory concerns, safety issues, 
and debates about its impact on traditional industries and workers. Balancing innovation and responsible governance 
remain paramount as the shared economy continues to evolve and reshape the modern economic landscape.  
1.1 Objectives 
With the latest statistics showing that up to 40% of trucks on the road are empty, and with last-mile delivery reporting 
a large number of deadhead miles by their drivers, there is precedent to find a solution that reduces this waste in the 
system. This paper aims to address that waste by introducing a shared last-mile delivery platform, secured through 
blockchain technology. In line with sustainability and net zero initiatives set by several countries worldwide, this paper

Furthermore, not considered in this comparison is the potential cost of hiring a driver. In the event that one of these 
centres has very few deliveries to make, they may forego the option to hire a driver for that day, instead relying on the 
platform to connect them with a partner that has a truck bound for that location: 
 
5.2 Smart Contract Costs 
In blockchain technology, gas costs refer to the fees required to execute transactions or smart contracts on platforms 
like Ethereum. These costs are measured in ""gas,"" a unit that quantifies the computational work needed for execution. 
Efficient smart contract design is crucial to minimize gas usage, ensuring that operations are cost-effective and 
accessible for users. High gas fees can deter usage and impact the overall scalability and usability of blockchain 
applications. Table 2 summarizes the expected average cost for running each function in the contract.

As seen in the table, the deployment of the smart contract is by far the most cost-heavy part, averaging $31. 
Fortunately, this is a one-time expense incurred at the beginning of the platform's lifecycle. Registering a company 
and a vehicle are also infrequent events after the initial setup, with each instance costing a relatively low $1-1.5. The 
primary recurring actions on the platform, offering space and requesting delivery, cost $1.7 and $0.6 each. Comparing 
the addition costs incurred by the smart contract, shown in Table 2 with the potential savings discussed in section from 
the reduced travel time, this study concludes that the proposed platform has a positive net cash value over time over.  
 
5.4 Validation  
To validate the authenticity and robustness of a smart contract, it is imperative to carry out a thorough security analysis. 
Smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements coded on a blockchain, handle significant financial and 
operational functions. Therefore, any vulnerabilities or errors in the code can lead to severe financial losses, 
unauthorized access, or system failures. A thorough security analysis involves examining the contract for potential 
bugs, weaknesses, and compliance with best practices, as well as testing its robustness against various attack vectors. 
Additionally, it includes assessing gas efficiency to avoid excessive transaction costs. Ensuring the security of smart 
contracts not only protects assets and data but also builds trust among users and stakeholders, reinforcing the platform's 
credibility and long-term viability. Recommended analysis for this smart contract involves the following: 
• 
Access Control Vulnerabilities 
• 
Uninitialized Storage Pointers 
• 
Gas Efficiency 
• 
Unhandled Exceptions  
 
6. Conclusion 
As we conclude this study, the exploration of blockchain technology's role in enhancing sustainability within the 
shared economy has revealed promising potential. By developing and testing a shared last-mile delivery platform on 
1152","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
 
© IEOM Society International 
the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity and Remix IDE, we demonstrated significant improvements in both economic 
efficiency and sustainability. The security analysis confirms the robustness of the platform, highlighting its resistance 
to infiltration and tampering while maintaining cost-effective gas usage. The successful deployment and favorable 
results of this platform showcase the transformative impact blockchain technology can have on modern logistics. It is 
our recommendation therefore that this platform be further refined and adopted by relevant distribution networks to 
realize its full potential. While the study presents promising results, it is important to note certain limitations. The 
study did not account for the time factor, or the type of vehicles used for deliveries, potentially influencing the 
efficiency and sustainability of the process. The timing of orders could significantly affect when customers receive 
their deliveries, depending on traffic conditions, delivery schedules, number of other customers in the area, and 
operational constraints. Addressing these factors in future research would provide a more comprehensive 
understanding of the system's performance under various conditions.

Abstract 
This study focuses on the implementation of Lean Warehousing and ABC methodologies in a distribution company 
to optimize warehouse operations and improve the service level. The results showed an increase in the service 
level by 5.8% and a reduction of the return rate to 30.2%. An exhaustive analysis was carried out to identify and 
eliminate waste such as waiting times and unnecessary movements, designing an implementation plan tailored to 
the company's specific needs. This plan included the reorganization of the warehouse, the reduction of inventories 
using the ABC multi-criteria method, and the application of Lean Warehousing. The results showed significant 
improvements in the level of service, reduction of delivery times, reduction of order errors and an increase in 
customer satisfaction, as well as an optimization of resources and reduction of operating costs.

1. Introduction
The company under study is a Peruvian company dedicated to the distribution of food and beverages; its base of 
operations is located in the district of Villa El Salvador, Lima, Peru. The company currently works with a total of 
8 suppliers and 14 brands and supplies the districts of San Juan de Miraflores, Villa María del Triunfo, Villa El 
Salvador, Lurín, Santiago de Surco, Surquillo, and Chorrillos. The company operates in the traditional food and 
beverage distribution channel. This channel is characterized by the sale of products through smaller stores and 
establishments, such as bodegas, local markets, and small stores, and is registered as a single limited liability 
company (Compu Empresa, 2020). In addition, the company has a broad portfolio of products ranging from pastas, 
canned fish, pastries, cookies, chocolates, condiments, etc. 
Despite the growth of the food sector, which in recent years has grown by 2.2% on average annually, contributing 
32.8% to the manufacturing GDP and 2.6% to the national GDP (BCRP, 2020), and generating 8.5% of 
employment, the industry faces significant problems such as late deliveries and incomplete orders. These 
shortcomings have a negative impact on customer satisfaction and competitiveness, evidencing inefficient 
inventory management and lack of commitment to optimal service levels. 
The Peruvian food sector also faces volatility in food prices, which has led to significant increases in production and 
distribution costs. This not only affects the ability of companies to maintain optimal inventory levels, but also

6. Conclusions 
 Through this research, it has been demonstrated that the adoption of management techniques such as the 
5S methodology and the ABC Multicriteria classification can have a significant impact on the efficiency of 
logistics operations. By decreasing product search and movement times, service capacity is increased and 
customer satisfaction indexes are significantly improved. In this way, companies can overcome the 
logistical challenges inherent to their industry and optimize their operational performance. 
 
 Considering the root causes, thanks to the Lean Warehousing based applications, the excess inventory, the 
reduction of average daily order returns, the reduction of picking time by about 25 minutes were 
considerably reduced. Our applications with the proposed tools fought against our problem analysis and 
came out victorious after the arduous investigation in this distribution company. 
 
 In conclusion, we consider the level of service improvement and work standardization, since these indexes 
have a positive impact not only on the company under investigation, but also on all the distributors that 
wish to apply constant improvements. The increase in the rate of orders allows us to improve the capacity 
of response to the client, leading to a better experience for the client. Therefore, the company will have 
positive results regarding competitiveness not only in the market, but also with itself. Also, the improvement 
in profitability and non-existence of wasted orders and/or deliveries.

Abstract 
By using concurrent engineering (CE) practitioners expect that design alternatives and their related process and 
technology alternatives are dealt with simultaneously and interactively at the early stages of product development. The 
focus is on both product and process by involving all related internal and external stakeholders. This study is intended 
to investigate the process of implementing concurrent engineering, tools used, level of implementation, and its impact 
on users' performance. Related literature was reviewed including major elements, activities, tools and techniques, 
benefits and barriers to success, best practices, and latest trends. Based on that, a survey was conducted, that included 
a representative sample of industrial firms, to study the level of awareness of concurrent engineering, practices and 
implementation levels, and its impact on different performance levels. A sample of 80 organizations (manufacturing 
and services) in UAE was taken. Major findings include that there is a relatively good awareness of concurrent 
engineering practices, the working culture supports early involvement of all stakeholders but lack the needed team 
building and training, and most CE practices are based on the experience and the initiatives of related employees and 
not based on a disciplined process. Moreover, they use integrated information technology tools without paying the 
same attention to supporting tools and software, and top management role in settling disputes and conflict resolution 
got the highest score, whereas empowering teams got the lowest. Finally, the study concluded that concurrent 
engineering has a clear impact on improving performance. Specifically, communication, cooperation, integration, and 
information sharing between different functions at the company-wide level, improving customer satisfaction, reducing 
after-design engineering changes, improving the overall quality, improving competitiveness/market share, improving 
productivity, reducing development time and time to market, and increasing return on investment. People-related 
practices had the highest correlation with performance followed by those related to used tools.

Introduction
In the traditional product cycle, designs and drawings are produced before continuing the analysis and preparation of 
manufacturing instructions. Concurrent engineering aims to overcome such limitations, by having a collaborative 
approach to product development that integrates design, manufacturing, and other relevant processes from the outset, 
aiming to streamline the development lifecycle, reduce time-to-market, enhance product quality, and minimize costs. 
This methodology emphasizes parallelism and interdisciplinary communication among different teams and 
stakeholders, enabling simultaneous progress across various stages of product development (Huang et al., 2024), 
(Ghazilla et al., 2021), (Siregar et al., 2015), (Kusiak, 2009). Traditionally, product development followed a sequential 
model where each stage was completed before moving on to the next. However, CE allows for iterative progress and 
early consideration of factors such as manufacturing constraints, cost implications, and user requirements, leading to 
more efficient decision-making (Li et al., 2023), (Matsumoto et al., 2020), (Huang et al., 2012), (Pahl et al., 2008). 
Key principles of Concurrent Engineering include the early involvement of stakeholders, utilization of advanced tools 
and technologies like computer-aided design (CAD) and simulation, and a focus on collaboration and integration 
throughout the development process (Zhang et al., 2022), (Sangwan et al., 2018), (Wang et al., 2010), (Kim et al., 
2007). By adopting Concurrent Engineering practices, organizations can adapt more swiftly to market changes,

5. Conclusions 
There is a relatively good awareness of concurrent engineering practices. People and Leadership practices had higher 
scores compared to both Process and Tools practices, with the Process practices being the lowest. The working culture 
supports early involvement of all stakeholders but lacks the needed team building and training. Most CE practices are 
based on the experience and the initiatives of related employees and not based on a disciplined process. The use of 
integrated information technology tools got the highest score that assures the need for coordination, communication, 
integration, and information sharing as a core practice for the success of CE implementation, unfortunately, without 
paying the same attention to supporting tools and software. The top management role in settling disputes and conflict 
resolution got the highest score, whereas empowering teams got the lowest in Leadership practices. Concurrent 
engineering has a clear impact on improving communication, cooperation, integration, and information sharing 
between different functions, improving customer satisfaction, reducing after-design engineering changes, improving 
the overall quality, improving competitiveness/market share, improving productivity, integrating efforts to finalize 
customer requirements more quickly, reducing development time and time to market, and increasing return on 
investment. People’s practices had the highest correlation with performance followed by the Tools practices. There are 
no variations in responses of different CE practices and resulted performance between manufacturing and service 
organizations, and with respect to the size of the organization, except for Process practices between manufacturing and 
services, and the “Benefits” between different sizes of organizations, with the benefit to high-sized ones.

Abstract 
The operations in a liquefied petroleum gas plant require risks in the posture of workers during the performance of the 
operational activities of bottling, which can affect the integrity of the workers, as well as generate excessive operating 
times and affect productivity. Productivity currently stands at 78%, which is below the company's minimum goal of 
85%. Therefore, due to the consequences it generates, it is essential to be a subject of study, so the objective of the 
research is to improve the productivity of the packaging operation by proposing a dysergonomic risk management 
model. The evaluation of the criticality of dysergonomic risks by workstation was carried out by means of the Triple 
Criteria Qualitative Identification and Estimation Matrix in which the activities of injecting liquefied petroleum gas, 
quality control, sealing and stacking of packaged balloons were defined as those requiring corrective actions due to 
the adverse effects they cause. The methods for assessing the dysergonomic risks of the activities are carried out by 
means of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH). Finally, there was a 10.4% increase in the productivity of packaged balloons.

1. Introduction
In the work carried out in a liquefied petroleum gas balloon bottling plant, occupational ergonomics is a fundamental 
factor for the integrity of employees and their work performance; it is necessary to control dysergonomic conditions 
such as repetitive movements, frequent lifting and forced postures (Loa-Puris et al., 2021).  In Peru, the “Basic standard 
on ergonomics and dysergonomic risk assessment procedure” (Ministerial Resolution No. 375-2008-TR) establishes 
a procedure for evaluating ergonomic aspects with the objective of contributing to the physical, mental and social 
well-being of the worker. The company in question is in the district of Villa el Salvador and has been competing in 
the hydrocarbon sector for more than 20 years, packaging, distributing, and marketing liquefied petroleum gas 
cylinders with an average production of 1502 cylinders in a workday, packaging an average of 250 cylinders per hour. 
They currently pack 5 kg, 10 kg and 45 kg capacity balls, and 85% of their production corresponds to 10 kg capacity 
balls. The problem that motivates the study is that there is a lack of a preventive culture of disergonomic risks, which 
exposes workers to repetitive lifting with overload during the packaging process, impacting on absenteeism of

6. Conclusion 
Based on the type of activities carried out in the company under study, it can be stated that the ball packaging process 
presents forced postures in carrying out the tasks and therefore requires an exhaustive analysis of the jobs to mitigate 
the risks that occurs, thus confirming its consistency with the study by Castillo et al. (2022).  
 
Firstly, it is specified that by using the qualitative risk identification and estimation matrix, it was possible to determine 
that the activities of LPG injection, quality control and sealing, in addition to the stacking of packaged cylinders, were 
the most critical tasks in the packaging process, since they presented a significant risk that meant taking immediate 
corrective actions. With the activities defined in the evaluation, the risk level was quantified using the RULA and 
NIOSH tools, where the lack of information and awareness about efficient ergonomics management at work was also 
witnessed. The use of these tools is consistent with the study by Lara-Lezcano et al. (2023) where it is evident that the 
quantification of the risk level of the activities under study was possible through methodologies of ergonomic scope. 
The results of this article indicated that immediate changes were required in the performance of tasks with greater 
criticality, since the consequences involved a decrease in physical capacity, musculoskeletal disorders and, 
consequently, a level of productivity below the goal established by the company. . After the implementation of the 
improvements, the proposals were validated to identify that the level of postural risk was reduced and thus 
improvements in productivity. On the one hand, the LPG injection activities, as well as quality control and sealing, 
reduced the risk level by 71.4% in both activities, the risk levels with a score of 7 were reduced to 2. On the other 
hand, the The activity of stacking packaging balloons had a reduction in the lifting index from 4,793 to 2,445, 
equivalent to a reduction of 48.9%, this as a result of the load weight no longer requiring the lifting of two balloons 
simultaneously. 
 
Finally, the preliminary test was carried out with the objective of analyzing the new productivity, an average increase 
of 10.4% in productivity was evident, as well as a reduction in average packaging time of 27.5%. In this way, the new 
productivity index results in 88.4%, exceeding the target indicator established by the company under study. 
 
Based on the final results, it was possible to corroborate that with the implementation of an ergonomic model based 
on ergonomic methodologies, evaluation and analysis of the most critical jobs, greater productivity and a lower risk 
of harm to collaborators can be obtained, validating the study by Loa-Puris et al. (2021) that presents the evaluation 
of overexertion and postures in order to propose an ergonomic model design in the LPG cylinder injection and painting 
position in a plant in the hydrocarbon sector, evidencing improvements in its productivity.

Abstract 
The food industry is one of the most important around the world and in this sector, we can highlight the part dedicated 
to the production of fruit in its different presentations. In this area, customers are usually demanding when placing 
their orders to companies, so it has been an important issue to have proper control of the products that are rejected, 
otherwise it could even turn into a financial inconvenience. In accordance with the above mentioned, it has been 
decided to propose a model that could be useful for the problems previously raised, which consists of the use of 3 
Lean Manufacturing tools: Jidoka, Standardized Work and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) focused on its fourth 
pillar, in order to reduce the percentage of rejected products. The proposed model using Arena software was able to 
reduce the rejected products from 16.27% to a value of 7.61%. Likewise, the Jidoka tool reduced the lots rejected due 
to fruit pulp bags with extra air by 11.76%, Standardized Work tool reduced lots rejected due to bag improperly sealed 
by 18.89% and the TPM kept the levels of lots rejected due to presence of seed.

1. Introduction
The food industry seemed to focus on reducing waste and production costs without paying much or any attention to 
customer satisfaction. However, human capital has the potential to find efficient ways to operate. Therefore, recently 
we can see that the industry has changed its focus towards the customer and is focusing on producing goods that are 
in line with customer demands (Alawamleh et al., 2022). Despite these changes, the problems have not disappeared 
from this industry and a common issue in this sector is the matter of packages that are rejected by customers for 
defective products. To mention one example, there is a case of study that shares this problem, focusing on the 
packaging stage, for which a technique was sought that achieves an automatic quality control while the production is 
being satisfied. Given this, the proposal had a CNN-based approach, obtaining significant results with respect to 
rejection rate and was able to detect at least 99. 93% of the sealing defects that occur in any production (Banus et al., 
2021). Another case of study was related to the fulfillment of the requirements on the products by the customer that 
took place in a company exporting handle in which they applied Lean tools such as Jidoka, Kanban, Visual Control 
and Standard Work, from which they obtained positive results such as reducing labeling errors by 2%, the excess of 
platforms by 0. 72% and the search time of a product at 4.5 hours per day (Lua et al., 2022). Among all the investigation 
behind, the authors in this article have realized that there is a lack of information and research around the main issue: 
the rejection of defective products particularly in the food industry. Having said that, it is significant and outstanding 
to develop cases around this forgotten field, it will lend a hand to all future students and researchers involved and 
focused on the topic. In view of this, the authors have decided to develop a case of study in which it would be possible 
to highlight the considerable number of end products that are not accepted by customers and the impact this has on 
the company. This scientific article is composed of the following: Introduction, which contains an overview of the

5.2 Graphic Results 
Among all this information collected, it is important to included visual summary of the results. To follow the guide of 
Table 3, the red color is considered as a high number or an aspect the authors must be concerned, the dark green is 
related to the objective, meanwhile the light green means that the objective have been surpassed and the yellow color 
is considered as a number not to worry about and in some cases reduced but not at the level of the objective. All this 
is shown in Figure 7.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Knowing that there is lack of research where tools, like Jidoka, TPM and Standardized Work, are compacted, this 
article would serve to expand knowledge about the use of those tools in the food sector, it could serve as a reference 
for other similar processes, such as the preparation of jams or fruit puree that usually implement machinery like the 
fruit pulp process. It should be noted that the way in which the tools have been put together is not intended to reduce 
time, but rather to distribute time by removing unnecessary activities (using Standardized Work) to give those minutes 
or seconds to more relevant activities and effectively perform a reduction in rejected products.  
To achieve a good outline of the process, it is necessary to maintain constant communication with the managers in 
charge of the production area through an intermediary that ensures requests for information. It must be considered that 
factories are not always enabled for external visits due to different reasons, having said that, it is also important to 
request the availability of those who provide the data so that the process is clearly explained in case it cannot be fully 
seen. 
 
6. Conclusion 
After having applied the simulation and having carried out the respective analysis, it was possible to reduce through 
the proposed model with the respective simulation, the percentage of rejected products, starting with a percentage of 
16.27% up to a value of 7.61%.  
 
Likewise, it was possible to achieve a decrease for the standardized packaging processes which were established so 
that there can be a considerable reduction in defective products from this operation, it can be noted that there was an 
improvement from a value of 16.30% to 13.22% with respect to the percentage of bag improperly sealed.  
 
In addition, it was possible to establish an adequate system for the revision after the weighing, resulting in an 
improvement from 17% to 15% in relation to the percentage of lots rejected due to bags with air. Finally, in the pulping 
activity, thanks to the fourth pillar of the TPM tool, it was possible to establish schedules for the inspection of the 
respective machine and thus solve this problem and prevent a presence from continuing to appear, however, the 
expected impact was not generated because the percentage of lots rejected due to presence of seed remained at 2.70%;

nevertheless, that number was not as high as the other indicators, thereby technically it was not as much of a matter 
as the others. Besides this fact, the TPM tool served to keep protocols for that activity specifically.

Abstract 
Green finance practices are a trend as companies adopt eco-friendly initiatives to drive green revenue, yet the impact 
on financial performance remains uncertain due to the potential mediating role of governance, risk, and compliance 
(GRC). This study investigates how green revenue affects the financial performance of mining, plantation, and 
manufacturing firms across ASEAN, examining GRC's mediating effect. Utilizing 2018-2022 panel data, financial 
performance measured by ROA and ROE is the dependent variable, green revenue is the independent variable, and 
composite GRC score encompassing governance, risk management, and compliance as mediating variable. Panel 
regression and path analysis assess the mediating effect. Findings reveal a significant positive relationship between 
green revenue and financial performance, mediated by GRC practices. Green finance boosts financial performance, 
especially when complemented by robust GRC implementation. The research underscores integrating sustainability 
and governance into business strategies for enhanced financial performance. The results provide empirical evidence 
of green finance's financial benefits and highlight GRC's crucial role in strengthening this relationship.

1. Introduction
Sustainable investment or green finance has become an important spotlight in various economic discussions in recent 
years (Scholtens 2017, Sachs, Woo et al. 2019). The existence of green finance is not only part of the issues faced by 
the banking sector alone but has also spread to various other non-banking sectors (Campiglio, Dafermos et al. 2018). 
Green finance is not only intended for the banking sector but also for non-banking industries (Vincent, Maglasang et 
al. 2018). Green finance aims not only to contribute to economic development but also to efforts to balance the 
economy and environment in a more sustainable manner(Schoenmaker and Schramade 2018).

Abstract 
This study aims to examine the moderating effect of perceived organizational support on the relationship between 
career development and lecturer performance in vocational education. The research was conducted using a 
quantitative approach and survey method involving lecturers from various vocational education institutions. Data 
were analyzed using moderation regression analysis. The results showed a positive and significant relationship 
between career development and lecturer performance. In addition, perceived organizational support was found to 
have a moderating effect on the relationship. Specifically, the positive impact of career development on lecturer 
performance is greater when perceived organizational support is high. These findings emphasize the importance of 
career development initiatives and organizational support in improving lecturer performance in vocational education 
institutions. This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence on the role of perceived 
organizational support in strengthening the relationship between career development and job performance. Practical 
implications for vocational education institutions include the implementation of effective career development 
programs and a supportive organizational climate to maximize lecturer performance.

1. Introduction
Vocational education plays a crucial role in preparing skilled workforce to meet growing demands and drive global 
economic growth (Cheng et al., 2018); (Mulder, 2019). In this context, the performance of the lecturer becomes a 
key factor that determines the quality of the graduate and the effectiveness of the vocational education institution as 
a whole. Studies conducted by Suarta et al. (2018) and Abelha et al. (2020) show that the performance of lecturers 
has a direct impact on the competence of graduates and their readiness to work in the era of Industry 4.0. However, 
although the important role of lecturers has been recognised, there is still a gap in the understanding of the factors 
affecting lecturer performance, especially in the context of unique vocational education (Tran et al., 2020); 
(Schreiber-Barsch and Mauch, 2019). Career development and organizational support have been identified as key 
elements that potentially affect employee performance in various sectors, including higher education (Caesens et al., 
2016); (Zhao et al. 2022); (Zacher et al., 2019). However, the interaction between these factors and their impact on 
the performance of lecturers in vocational education institutions is still not comprehensively explored. 
Career development, which includes a range of activities and programmes designed to enhance individual 
competencies and prospects, has been shown to have a positive impact on employee performance in various 
organizational contexts (Blokker et al., 2019); (Akkermans et al., 2020). In the academic environment, career

Abstract 
Revenues in the global logistics industry are projected to increase over the next few years. In Indonesia, the projected 
revenue will reach US$21.93 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow gradually. This is consistent with Indonesia’s 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the transportation and storage sector in 2023, which reached IDR1,231.2 trillion, 
or an increase of 13.96% over the previous year. In contrast, Indonesia’s logistics performance has suffered a setback. 
According to Logistics Performance Index (LPI) statistics for 2023, Indonesia scored 3.0 and ranked 61st out of 139 
countries. Therefore, this study aims to analyze potential risks and establish a priority scale for mitigation actions that 
can affect warehouse operational performance. This study utilized the Warehouse Performance Analysis model to 
identify risk events and the House of Risk model to analyze priority risk agents in mitigation action planning. The 
result showed that there were 59 risk events and 73 risk agents identified, including 16 risk agents prioritized as critical 
risk. This study also proposes 28 mitigation actions that can be implemented to mitigate those critical risk.

1. Introduction
The industry in the logistics sector in Indonesia will experience growth in the next few years. Revenue in the logistics 
service sector in Indonesia are projected to reach US$21.93 billion in 2024 and will continue to grow to US$24.24 
billion in 2028 (Statista 2024). This is also in line with the growth of Indonesia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 
the transportation and storage sector. In 2023, Indonesia’s GDP reached IDR20,892.4 trillion, of which the 
transportation and storage sector contributed IDR1,231.2 trillion, or 5.89% of the total GDP. Although this sector 
contributes only a small part of GDP, this sector has recorded the highest growth compared to other sectors that drive 
GDP growth, with growth of 13.96% (Badan Pusat Statistik 2024; Siahaan 2023). Despite the positive growth of the 
transportation and storage sector in Indonesia, in contrast, the quality of Indonesia’s logistics performance has 
declined. According to the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) statistics in 2023, Indonesia scored a total of 3.0 and 
ranked 61st out of 139 countries (World Bank 2023). In a survey conducted by Inbound Logistics in 2022, it was 
stated that there were 12 global challenges facing the logistics service industry. The three main challenges raised by 
more than 50% respondents connected to capacity, retaining qualified labor, and high operational cost (Inbound 
Logistics 2022). These challenges are also part of the risk that can affect logistics performance. Therefore, it is 
necessary to plan mitigation actions to reduce the potential for risk events to occur. 
Previous research focused on risk management issues has been carried out in various industry, for instance the study 
on supply chain risk management in the concrete manufacturing industry (Azizan et al. 2023), supply chain risk 
1224","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

of the prioritized mitigation actions focus on risks in the time dimension. This shows that the risk events in each 
indicator in the time dimension have a larger risk impact on warehouse operational performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Logistics management has become more complex as major challenges and disruptions come into effect. It is crucial 
to identify potential risks that might arise from warehouse operational activities and affect warehouse operational 
performance. In this study, we utilized the Warehouse Performance Analysis model to explore warehouse risks from 
time, quality, cost, and productivity dimensions and analyzed them using the House of Risk (HOR) method. From the 
risk assessment in the first phase of HOR, we were able to identify 59 risk events and 73 risk agents. The assessment 
was followed by an Aggregate Risk Potential (ARP) calculation and analysis using a pareto diagram, which resulted 
in 16 critical risk agents. From the mitigation action planning in the second phase of HOR, we formulated 28 mitigation 
action plans that can be implemented in warehouse operations activities to mitigate those critical risk agents. In future 
research, it is recommended to explore different logistics companies, considering that each company has a different 
business model and standard operating procedures. We strongly encourage the expansion of the scope of research that 
covers business processes in the logistics industries in a comprehensive way, not limited to risk in warehouse 
operations but also an extension of the dimensions and indicators in the process of risk identification in the goods 
delivery process to customers or last-mile logistics.

Abstract 
The increasing demand for components with tailored properties and functionally graded materials featuring adjustable 
interfaces is raising the requirements in gravity sand and die casting processes of aluminium. In response to these 
challenges, a novel controlled process based on injector casting is being developed. This innovative process involves 
the sequential pouring of two liquid aluminium alloys into a mould while mixing the two liquid phases. By adjusting 
the injector outlet, the process aims to achieve a horizontal flow deflection. This study systematically investigates two 
variations of horizontal deflections at the injector outlet and examines their impacts on flow volume rate, flow velocity, 
and the flow channel at the injector outlet in relation to their impact on the mixing characteristics. These variations 
are analysed through water model experiments. The findings from these water model experiments are critically 
evaluated to assess their applicability to the aluminium casting process. Based on these evaluations, conclusions are 
drawn to improve the design of an application-specific injector for a multi-material injector casting process (MMIC). 
The results offer valuable insights into optimising the manufacturing process to achieve the desired material properties 
and gradient configurations.

1. Manufacturing Challenges in Metal-Multimaterial Composites
A shift towards more intricate components is being witnessed across various sectors, presenting new hurdles for 
manufacturing processes and casting configurations in the foundry sector. Composite materials have superseded 
homogeneous castings, facilitating superior local adaptations. Recent advancements have focused on castings with 
tailored properties, known as castings with tailored properties or functional graded materials. These novel materials 
aim to achieve a defined gradual transition (gradient) between materials, a departure from the previously abrupt 
transition between two materials. Depending on the requirements, this transition can be executed either linearly or in 
layers within the process. The specific process design distinguishes between the production of thin-walled and 
voluminous multi-metal composites. (Mahamood and Titilayo Akinlabi 2017). 
Conventional casting techniques lack the capacity to modify local component characteristics during manufacturing. 
A novel and innovative multi-material injector casting process (MMIC) is being developed to fabricate castings from 
two distinct alumina within a single manufacturing process (Lisova et al. 2024). In this process, liquid aluminium is 
introduced through a ceramic injector that remains immersed in the liquid phase throughout the casting process, 
enabling sequential casting with two different alloys. Aside from establishing a defined boundary layer, this method 
also ensures a positive temperature gradient in the casting, thus preventing oxide inclusion in the liquid phase. 
An analysis of the relevant parameters regarding the design of a casting system revealed that the melt feed towards 
and through the injector, as well as the deflection at the end of the injector, significantly influence the flow behaviour

5. Results and conclusion 
The introduction of a horizontal deflection at the outlet of the crucible has the effect of both decelerating the downward 
flow of the fluid and directing it horizontally, which is beneficial in the context of MMIC. The results of a reference 
experiment demonstrated that the flow velocities of water and aluminium are highly comparable, and that water model 
experiments can be used as a reliable reference for the casting process. Given that the thermal and chemical 
characteristics of an aluminium melt cannot be fully represented here, the resulting flow behaviour may not be entirely 
accurate with regard to the formation of turbulence and the deposition of an oxide film on the melt surface. To 
compensate for this, the use of filters is considered. The plug-stroke is of critical importance for the volumes tested, 
with a 5 mm plug stroke resulting in probably insufficient flow rates and velocities. Conversely, a plug-stroke of 10 
mm significantly enhances the formation of turbulence at the fluid surface and the introduction of oxide bubbles into 
the melt. The size of the outlet opening can be used to control and concentrate the outlet channel and the gradient 
height. 
 
In the examination of plug strokes and their effects on flow velocity, it is evident that there is no further significant 
increase for plug strokes of 8 mm or greater. Notably, plug strokes of 10 mm and 5 mm maintain a flow velocity under 
the critical limit of 0.5 m/s. The horizontal deflection effectively redirects and decelerates the poured fluid into a 
desired horizontal angle. This is particularly effective for the bowl geometry with a plug stroke of 10mm, in terms of 
mixing, both with and without a ceramic foam filter. The foam filter plays a critical role in significantly reducing the 
flow velocity of water by 82-84%, and it mitigates mixing in the lower part of the casting. Additionally, a larger outlet 
gap is beneficial as it does not significantly impact the volume flow rate and only has a minor effect on flow velocity. 
However, it is crucial for avoiding clogging during the casting of aluminium and can aid in positioning the gradient 
area. 
 
Despite these advantages, the mixing inside the mould is inhomogeneous for the two lateral outlet gaps of the injector. 
To address the issue of residual water remaining in the horizontal deflection, it is necessary to design a geometry that 
encourages complete drainage. Furthermore, the anticipated suction, as predicted by Rottenegger et al. (2024), was 
demonstrated in the MMIC process, confirming their hypothesis. 
 
6. Transfer to Aluminium Casting: Study Limitations and Future Developments 
The plug stroke of 5 mm creates a flow velocity of 0.13 m/s to 0.24 m/s, which may be insufficient for a casting 
process. However, this velocity avoids strong turbulence at the surface, thus preventing the introduction of oxides into 
the casting. The plug stroke of 10 mm results in a flow velocity of 0.34 m/s to 0.55 m/s, which is well suited for an 
aluminium casting process. However, it is causing strong turbulence on the surface as well as the introduction of 
oxides into the casting. It is with this plug stroke that the advantages of the bowl in terms of the outlet angle are better 
utilised. The outlet gap serves to compress the outflow stream, although the likelihood of adhesion of oxidised films 
and the resulting faster clogging of the gap necessitates the recommendation of a higher outlet gap. 
 
The filter exhibits beneficial properties with regard to the prevention of oxidation. However, the slow flow velocity 
of 0.04 to 0.07 m/s, is to be regarded as highly critical for an aluminium casting process. 
 
It can be inferred that a plug stroke of approximately 10 mm should be sufficient. A minor flow velocity through the 
wider outlet channel has a beneficial effect in combination with this plug stroke. Further experiments with a larger 
outlet gap are recommended facilitating a more targeted mixing process through this outlet channel. 
 
The strong turbulence and introduction of oxides into the casting have demonstrated that partially filled pipe flow can 
have a significant impact on the quality of the casting. If the casting geometry is similar in size to that used here, it is 
essential to have a comprehensive understanding of pipe flow and slug flow in partially filled pipes. 
 
Additionally, it can be observed that the gradient is not distributed evenly due to the two lateral outlets of the injector. 
It would be beneficial to investigate whether opening the injector outlet to all sides or rotating the casting during the 
casting process could improve the mixing of the material. Finally, it is advisable to employ a cooling plate for a 
directed vertical solidification of the initial melt to prevent deep penetration of the second melt.

Abstract 
This study explores artificial intelligence (AI) technology trends and health and medical references. The study 
describes how healthcare will change with the evolution of AI technology, and also summarizes its core technologies. 
This problem is viewed from the perspective of 'information overload', the medical literature doubles every three 
years, and in addition to the explosive increase in patient data, approximately 700,000 new scientific papers are 
published every year. It also predicts a shortage of oncologists, and the demand is expected to increase by 42%. Due 
to this expected shortage, doctors will not be able to explore the best treatment for patients in clinical trials. This 
problem can be solved with AI Watson's motivation to solve the healthcare industry problem. Moreover, Watson 
Oncology solutions are reviewed from the end-user interface perspective. This study also examines the global 
corporate platform business and explains how AI and machine learning technologies are expanding in the market 
through use cases. It highlights the ecosystem partner business model that can support startups and venture companies, 
including healthcare models. Finally, we identify the need to review partnerships with healthcare companies in terms 
of solution innovation. Artificial intelligence and Watson will bring many changes to the healthcare business. This 
study deals with AI, understanding of AI innovation, cloud platform business, the importance of datasets, and the need 
to improve the knowledge base further.

Abstract 
Cancer is the number one cause of death worldwide, and active research is underway at various institutions. 
Additionally, as we enter an era where diseases can be predicted and treated based on individual characteristics, 
interest in cancer treatment is increasing. Recently, research combining big data and artificial intelligence has been 
increasing, and artificial intelligence-related research is also being actively conducted in the field of genetic analysis. 
Although many cancer-specific genes are being discovered using gene expression data, the reality is that high-
dimensional gene expression data has limitations. There are various methods in the field of machine learning to address 
these limitations. Therefore, in this study, unlike the existing analysis method using gene expression data, we 
attempted to overcome the limitations of existing research by applying it to the field of machine learning. In other 
words, the goal is to apply machine learning methods to find gene groups that can clearly distinguish between cancer 
samples and normal samples. Detect meaningful features through dimensionality reduction and variable contribution 
algorithms. Using this method, High Ranked Genes detected a total of 432 gene groups and provided better 
classification results than existing analysis methods. In the future, it is necessary to investigate this gene group in 
detail using various data. Once this verification is confirmed, We hypothesize that HRGs have the potential to become 
a new group of genes especially for cancer classification.

1. Introduction
The breast cancer RNA-seq data included a total of 1,441 samples and 32,613 genes. In the data preprocessing phase, 
genes with zero and low expression levels were removed and gene identifiers were changed to NCBI gene IDs for 
future gene functional analyses. Filtering was performed on 1,441 samples and 32,613 genes. 
Out of the total 1,712 samples, 221 and 911 were normal samples. In other words, the ratio between normal and 
cancerous samples was about 1:9.2, which means that the data was quite unbalanced. Since the balancing problem 
plays a major role in machine learning, we implemented a resampling process to balance the samples. During this 
process, the data is balanced between the oversampling algorithms using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling 
technique.

In this study, we compare the existing method and the newly proposed method. In comparison, Genome 1 was 
generated by hand-running and adjusting the number of genes to a specific threshold. Figure 2 shows an overview of 
the weight analysis.

3. Conclusion 
A total of 432 genes were obtained through the linkage weight algorithm and designated as HRG (High Ranking 
Genes). To analyze the function of HRG, DAVID, the most representative tool was used. 
 
The results of GO analysis using the DAVID tool were summarized. The results are satisfactory with a cut-off p value 
of ≤ 0.04, and it was confirmed that many results were obtained at the cellular level, such as cell signaling, cell 
differentiation, and cell growth. These results confirmed that many terms related to cancer were found at the cellular 
level. 
 
Pathway analysis was performed using the DAVID tool and mapped to the KEGG pathway database. As with GO 
analysis, results with p-values of 0.041 or less were summarized. For Pathway, results were similar to those for 
neuroactive receptor-ligand interactions, systemic lupus erythematosus, and alcoholism. 
 
The signaling pathway analyzed above has been reported as a result of research related to breast cancer. Table 2 shows 
the KEGG pathway analysis of HRG. 
 
Table 2. shows the KEGG pathway analysis of HRG. 
 
 
 
In this study, unlike existing DEG analysis methods that utilize RNA sequence data, we propose a classification 
method that incorporates machine learning. Existing DEG analysis methods find DEGs through single gene testing. 
On the other hand, this method considers interactions and variable meanings between features through machine 
learning and proposes a method to find gene sets based on their combination. Looking at the expression pattern of 
HRG, like DEG, there is no obvious difference in expression level. In other words, if you look at the HRG genes 
individually, they do not have much meaning, but if you look at these genes as a combination of gene sets, you can 
think of them as a set of distinguishing genes. Between cancer and normal. 
 
Models built with HRG show better classification performance than models built with the top 450 features.

In this study, we investigated and evaluated models based only on the dataset provided by TCGA. Therefore, if datasets 
are generated by other organizations in the future, we would like to confirm the generalizability of our model through 
external validation. That is, more detailed investigation through generalization of the model is needed to determine 
whether this set of genes is specific to breast cancer or only to the classification model built in this study.

Abstract 
In this paper, we reviewed the configuration and flight principles of drones and described the types of main parts used 
in drones. In addition, we obtained up-to-date information and confirmed any unusual problems that may occur during 
the assembly and control of important components of a drone. In particular, problems that occur in the wireless 
communication process between the drone and the remote control were summarized and an appropriate command 
cycle in wireless communication was selected to ensure smooth command transmission and reception of status 
information. 
Among the commercial drones, we chose a product that has a camera module for video transmission and allows the 
addition of a communication-capable controller. The drone selected was drone, which was used to perform image 
processing-based autonomous flight. Using video information and sensor information, the current status and location 
of the drone were determined and, based on this, an autonomous flight to the target point was performed.

1. Introduction
Traditionally, RF communication has been widely used in wireless communication, but recently, thanks to the 
popularization of smartphones, wireless communication based on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is increasing. Wireless 
communication is a communication technology that transmits information over a long distance using radio waves 
without an actual cable connection. At this time, the promised information transmission format is called a protocol, 
and the strength of the communication signal is usually expressed in dB units. 
Wireless communications use the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Industrial Scientific and Medical Band). Communication 
devices using this band may be used if interference between ISM devices and communication devices using this band 
is tolerated. 
BLE is a communication method included in Bluetooth 4.0 and is a recently widely used wireless communication 
method. Low Power has been redesigned to focus on using broadcasts to increase connection speeds. The baud rate 
of low-power Bluetooth radios is limited to 1 Mbps or less, depending on the Bluetooth version. This is a theoretical 
upper limit and can be significantly reduced due to various factors including protocol overhead, CPU and Wi-Fi 
limitations, and software limitations. Therefore, the best scenario for real-world usage depends on the limits of both 
peers, but the upper limit on the amount of data transferred per second is approximately 3 to 11 KB. BLE has a short

Sea level pressure p0 changes daily depending on the weather and season. Korea’s sea level pressure on this day can 
be checked on the Korea Meteorological Administration website. If correction using sea level pressure is not 
appropriate, calculations can be made using 1013.25hPa, or P0, which corresponds to 1 standard atmosphere of 
standard atmosphere. Standard atmosphere is an atmosphere in which temperature, pressure, etc. are expressed in a 
simplified form that is very similar to the average state of the actual atmosphere. Currently, the most widely used type 
is the International Standard Atmosphere adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The sea surface 
temperature in temperate regions is 15°C and the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1013.25 hPa. 
 
Figure 4 shows the attitude of the drone flying toward the target. In the latter case, the drone takes off, moves forward, 
turns 90 degrees, moves forward again and lands near the target point. In this process, the drone's current attitude 
information is collected every 150ms using BLE. The drone's status is displayed in a graph. The horizontal axis of the 
graph is expressed in actual time units (seconds), with a measurement error of less than 50 ms per second. Analyzing 
the drone's movement based on the schematic, it moves almost unchanged in the case of rolling motion, and in terms 
of tilt, it moves quickly forward for 4 seconds and then quickly moves forward for about 7 seconds. Then, eight 
seconds later, you hit the brakes and land. This return value indicates that the rotation lasted 5 to 6 seconds and was 
less than the target number of rotations.

3. Conclusion 
In this paper, vision-based automated flight was performed using Petron, a mini drone from ViRobot, a commercial 
drone with an integrated camera and an open protocol that allows separate controller configuration. 
This automatic flight execution algorithm can be divided into two parts. The first part is to control the mini-drone by 
composing individual commands using the command protocol and sending these commands to the drone. The second 
part is to obtain the current position from the control computer control and construct commands to achieve the goal. 
Petrone made a large error in the process of estimating altitude using the barometric pressure sensor, making it difficult 
to maintain a stable hovering state. In addition, due to the increase in weight due to the installation of the FPV module, 
problems such as overload and shortened lifespan of the installed motor occur during operation. Although conducting 
a full test flight is disadvantageous due to engine failure, autonomous flight of mini drones is possible by classifying 
each movement of the drone and establishing a system for automatic flight. 
The automatic flight performed in this study was conducted in an environment where grid lines were drawn on the 
ground to reduce the difficulty of automatic flight, and the trajectory was moved based on the grid lines on the ground. 
However, we believe that autonomous flight can be realized by increasing the reliability of hovering with drones 
equipped with more powerful sensors and expanding it to the general environment by applying an algorithm that 
detects feature points in the image. 
In this paper, we looked at the basic theory of drones, mini-drone interpretation and information processing, and 
performance improvement methods. The automatic flight algorithm applicable to medium to large drones equipped 
with various sensors and having high flight stability is applied to the mini drone to display commands. Even mini 
drones can achieve autonomous flight using sensors and visual information.

Abstract 
The modern automobile industry is constantly evolving, and consumer preferences are significantly influenced by 
design aspects. This paper aims to analyze the impact of car design on sales using Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN). For the study, images of the top 100 cars with the highest sales in 2022 were collected to extract powerful 
visual features. The trained CNN model identifies the correlation between specific elements of car design and sales, 
and constructs a predictive model. Additionally, the model is utilized to collect and analyze price and fuel efficiency 
data of the top 100 cars. This provides objective numerical data for comparing designs and evaluating the predictive 
results of the model reliably. The experimental results highlight the importance of design elements and are expected 
to offer insights into marketing strategies and product development in the automobile industry. Moreover, to verify 
the model's generalization capability, the predictive performance is evaluated using arbitrary car data, not from the 
top 100 cars with high sales in 2022. This is crucial for confirming the model's ability to categorize cars and predict 
sales within those categories.

1. Introduction
People consider various factors when buying a car, including price, design, weight, safety, and fuel efficiency. Among 
these, the impact of design on car purchase decisions is a curious subject, prompting this study Price is no longer the 
sole crucial factor, as customers now demand more features in their vehicles. Customer preferences have evolved, 
with factors like image and practicality taking precedence over traditional considerations like environmentalism. 
The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of car design on sales and to predict the ideal car model that people 
are most likely to buy. This study aims to provide insights into the key features that influence consumer purchasing 
decisions in the passenger car market. 
2. Background
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning algorithms specifically designed for processing 
structured grid data such as images. The architecture of a CNN is inspired by the organization of the animal visual 
cortex, where individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field, known as the

6. Conclusion 
This study analyzed the car sales data from 2022 using various data visualization and machine learning techniques. 
By visualizing the relationships between sales volume, price, and fuel efficiency, we identified key trends and insights. 
The use of CNNs allowed us to examine the impact of car design on sales performance, providing valuable predictions 
despite some limitations. 
 
Our findings indicate that while price and fuel efficiency are significant factors influencing sales, the visual appeal of 
a car also plays a crucial role. The machine learning model demonstrated the potential for accurate sales predictions 
based on car design, although further refinement is needed to improve accuracy. 
 
Overall, this research underscores the importance of integrating data visualization and advanced analytics in 
understanding market dynamics and making informed business decisions. Future work should focus on enhancing 
model accuracy and exploring additional features that impact car sales.

4. Results 
The results of our study on the impact of car design on sales provide valuable insights into the predictive capabilities 
of our model. While the model accurately predicted the sales volume for certain vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand 
Cherokee which had a sales volume of 264,444 units, it overestimated the sales volume for others, like the Honda 
Pilot which had a sales volume of 143,062 units.  
 
This finding aligns with recent research which has demonstrated the efficacy of data-driven models in predicting new 
product demand in the automobile industry. The ability to accurately forecast sales is crucial for car manufacturers 
and dealerships, as it allows them to better align production, inventory, and marketing strategies to meet customer 
demand.  
 
However, it is important to consider the limitations and challenges associated with using predictive models for car 
sales. As highlighted in the literature, the quality and accuracy of the training data is critical to the performance of 
these models. Additionally, there are potential ethical implications to consider, such as the risk of discriminatory 
practices if demographic data is used to inform the predictions.  
 
Ultimately, the results of our study underscore the need for a nuanced and multifaceted approach to predicting car 
sales that takes into account not only design features, but also broader market trends, customer preferences, and ethical 
considerations (Figure 3 and Figure 4).

Abstract 
The construction industry is a crucial indicator of economic development and a significant contributor to a country's 
GDP. However, it is recognized for its potential adverse environmental impacts. The effects include environmental 
degradation, resource depletion, and social disruption, underscore the need for enhanced construction practices. In 
modern construction-management, technology plays an indispensable role in overcoming challenges and achieving 
project goals. Additionally, integrating sustainability into construction practices is increasingly important for 
environmental and social responsibility. This case study examines the pivotal role of technology in managing a 
residential construction project in Lisbon, which faced numerous challenges. These challenges emerge from variables 
such as Location, Field related and the unique characteristics of the site. The project is to build a four-story residential 
building and aimed to retain the historic facade of the original structure while integrating modern residential design. 
Despite significant encountered delays, the project achieved the desired outcome. Key challenges included multiple 
failed attempts to retain the facade, significant vegetation growth after the rainy seasons, unforeseen water springs 
during excavation, and disruptions from road closures and airplane traffic. Technological interventions involved 
advanced structural analysis software, drone technology, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), GPS and logistics-
management software, and AI-generated imagery. These solutions were crucial in addressing the challenges and 
ensuring effective construction-management. Data for this study were collected through direct observation. Future 
research can explore the long-term impacts of these technological solutions on construction efficiency and 
sustainability.

Abstract 
The production industry has the potential to make a significant contribution to the transition to a more sustainable 
future. With 24% of net greenhouse gas emissions coming from the industrial sector and producing companies having 
a significant impact on overall sustainability, the production industry will have to focus more on sustainability to 
achieve the ambitious political and societal sustainability goals. Due to the pressing nature of this topic, a considerable 
number of producing companies have already implemented sustainability goals. Nevertheless, at the operational level, 
decisions are still largely driven by economic considerations. This is due to a lack of understanding of the 
interrelationships between sustainability and production logistics objectives and the absence of a set of standardized 
indicators to quantify measures towards a more sustainable production. To address these points, this paper analyzes 
which aspects of sustainability can be influenced by production planning and control (PPC) and how these aspects 
interact with the traditional goals of production logistics. Moreover, key performance indicators (KPIs) are proposed 
as means of measuring improvements in these sustainability aspects. The integration of these KPIs into the target 
system of PPC allows for the optimization of production systems towards an operational point that reconciles 
production logistics and sustainability objectives.

1. Importance of Sustainability Goals in Production
The concept of sustainability has become a ubiquitous topic in our society. In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which serves as a guiding framework for the world to transition towards 
a more sustainable future. At the core of this agenda are the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which encompass 
17 economic, ecological, and social topics that are essential for increasing the sustainability worldwide (United 
Nations 2015). In 2021, the EU stated in its ‘Fit for 55’ agenda the goals of reducing net carbon emissions by 55% by 
2030 compared to 1990 and being climate neutral by 2050 (European Commission 2021). Such initiatives have been 
implemented across various countries, reflecting a general political consensus regarding the necessity for a sustainable 
future and leading to the enactment of more restrictive legislation. Moreover, the pervasive prominence of the 
sustainability discourse in society has prompted a corresponding shift in consumer behavior, with ecological and 
environmental considerations becoming increasingly salient in purchasing decisions  (Gnanapragasam et al. 2018; 
McKinsey & Company 2023). 
The growing importance of sustainability is forcing producing companies to intensify their efforts to become 
sustainable. Given that 24% of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from the industrial sector (Lee et al. 
2023) and that producing companies have a significant impact on other sustainability goals, this shift in focus of the 
production industry is necessary to achieve the ambitious political goals. Many producing companies already adopted 
sustainability goals and targets at the enterprise level (BMW Group 2019; Procter & Gamble 2020; Airbus 2023). In

powered electrochemical remediation system for the removal of heavy metal waste from wastewater. The system integrates 
solar energy harnessing with electrochemical processes to achieve efficient and sustainable removal of heavy metal ions. 
Key performance indicators, including removal efficiency, energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, downtime reduction, 
treatment capacity, and environmental impact, are considered to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the proposed 
framework. Through a comprehensive literature review and comparative analysis of existing countermeasures, this project 
aims to develop a scalable, environmentally friendly, and economically viable solution to address the pressing problem of 
heavy metal ion pollution in wastewater.

1. Introduction
Heavy metal pollution is an environmental phenomenon that causes environmental pollution and health issues. It causes 
water and soil pollution as well as contaminates the food supply chain by exposing the ecosystem to serious diseases. 
Due to the emergence of UAE's economic diversification, UAE has become a major source of mineral dust- containing 
heavy metals. There are different methods used in removing heavy metals from wastewater, like membrane filtration, 
adsorption, ion exchange and others. Out of all these techniques, a ""solar-powered electrochemical remediation system 
(SPEC)"" is currently prevalent globally for removing heavy metal ions from wastewater. It is a technology which uses 
solar energy to engage power in an electrochemical separation procedure required for water purification and removal of 
waste from water. SPEC takes into account a semiconductor, which is used to manipulate the electric charge of ions that 
are separated from water. SPEC is considered to be a suitable uniform process for treating municipal wastewater. Several 
successful attempts have been made wherein SPEC has separated and removed diluted arsenate- a derivative of arsenic, 
which is one of the main waste components from steel and mining industries from wastewater. One electrochemical 
method for treating heavy metal-contaminated water and wastewater is electrocoagulation. By passing an electrical 
current through electrodes, this technique destabilizes pollutants that are dissolved, suspended, or emulsified in 
wastewater; then, filtration is used to remove the contaminants. 
Removing heavy metal ions from wastewater is crucial for maintaining environmental cleanliness and safeguarding 
human health. Various methods have been developed for this purpose, categorized into adsorption, membrane, chemical, 
electric, and photocatalytic treatments. While adsorption techniques have been the focus of recent research, they face 
challenges such as simultaneous removal of different ion types, prolonged retention times, and the stability of adsorbents. 
Chemical and membrane methods are practical but encounter issues like the formation of large-volume sludge and the need

3.1.1 Advantages over conventional remediation systems 
As revealed in Table 4, solar power reduces reliance on conventional energy sources, resulting in lower operational costs 
and carbon emissions compared to grid-powered electrochemical remediation systems. Moreover, Solar-powered 
electrochemical remediation utilizes renewable energy sources and minimizes environmental impact, aligning with the 
UAE's sustainability goals and commitment to renewable energy. The modular design allows for easy scalability and 
adaptation to different site-specific requirements, making it suitable for both small-scale and large-scale applications 
across various contaminated sites in the UAE.

Remote monitoring and control capabilities enable operators to remotely manage and optimize system performance, 
reducing the need for on-site personnel and enhancing operational flexibility. Electrochemical remediation processes offer 
high efficiency and selectivity in heavy metal removal, achieving rapid and comprehensive remediation of contaminated 
environmental matrices compared to conventional methods such as physical or chemical treatments. Overall, the 
implementation of a solar-powered electrochemical remediation system offers a cutting-edge and sustainable solution 
for toxic heavy metal removal in the UAE, providing significant advantages over conventional methods in terms of energy 
efficiency, sustainability, effectiveness, and operational flexibility. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The scope of the ""electrochemical remediation system"" is considered to be vast and is currently trending toward treating 
and controlling wastewater and water pollution caused by industries with the help of electrochemical procedures. 
Fundamental and engineering research has established electrochemical deposition technology in metal recovery and heavy 
metal-effluent treatment. The development of an advanced solar-powered electrochemical remediation system offers a 
promising solution to the challenges posed by heavy metal waste contamination in wastewater. By leveraging solar energy 
and electrochemical processes, the proposed system demonstrates significant potential for efficient and sustainable 
removal of heavy metal ions. Through the integration of key performance indicators and a thorough analysis of existing 
countermeasures, this project lays the foundation for the design and implementation of a scalable, environmentally 
friendly, and economically viable remediation technology. Moving forward, continued research and development efforts 
are essential to optimize the performance and practical application of the proposed system, ultimately contributing to the 
preservation of water quality and the protection of human health and the environment.

Abstract 
This paper outlines the application of Lean Six Sigma principles in enhancing inventory management at a water and 
electricity distribution company. Employing the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control) methodology, 
the project targeted critical inefficiencies in the inventory systems, particularly focusing on electrical and mechanical 
equipment. Key achievements included a significant reduction in lead times from 13.08 days to 3.08 days, 
considerable cost savings, and enhanced operational efficiency. The integration of tools like Value Stream Mapping, 
Refurbishment operations, and advanced forecasting models facilitated these improvements, demonstrating the 
effectiveness of Lean Six Sigma in optimizing complex inventory systems. 
1. Introduction
This study presents a comprehensive application of Lean Six Sigma to optimize inventory management within a water 
and electricity company. The project was driven by the need to address inefficiencies caused by prolonged inventory 
lead times and demand variability, which impacted service delivery and operational costs. By adopting the DMAIC 
methodology, the project aimed to streamline inventory processes, enhance forecasting accuracy, and reduce 
operational waste. This approach not only aligned with organizational strategic goals but also ensured a structured 
pathway toward achieving significant improvements in inventory management.  
2. Literature review
Six Sigma is a statistical approach used to reduce variation within processes. It is primarily a project-focused approach 
that uses statistical tools to guide improvements through different stages. Six Sigma adopts the DMAIC (Define-
Measure-Analysis-Improve-Control) methodology to guide improvement teams through the stages of an 
improvement project (Antony and Scheumann 2022). Lean (also known as Lean Manufacturing) is another process 
improvement methodology that focuses on identifying stakeholder value throughout the value stream and 5 reducing 
forms of waste by creating value flow (Womack and Jones 1997). 
 Lean is a well-known quality management philosophy that requires involvement and commitment from the 
organization, client, and suppliers. Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a combination of both Lean and Six Sigma that forms a 
much more complete business strategy and philosophy that guides waste elimination and continuous process 
improvements (Zhang and Irfan 2012). Inventory management systems and techniques are used by businesses and 
companies of all sizes to monitor inventory levels, forecast demand, and place orders from suppliers. Among the 
frequently used inventory management systems are Just in Time (JIT), Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), and 
Materials Requirement Planning (MRP). The best system for a particular business will depend on several factors, 
such as the type of products the business sells, the size of the business, and the business's budget (Strack  2010). 
In sectors like water and electricity distribution, companies hold particular significance for inventory management 
due to the provision of essential services to customers (Becerra and Mula 2022.). These industries must ensure a 
consistent resource supply to meet demand, even during unexpected disruptions. However, managing inventory in 
these sectors comes with distinct challenges, including high associated costs, the need for reliable suppliers, and the

new work standards to maintain optimization gains, particularly through lean practices like regular stock reviews, 
dynamic buffer adjustments, and continuous monitoring of inventory processes. The new forecasting framework was 
standardized to enhance accuracy and efficiency, emphasizing documentation, KPI monitoring, response strategies 
for discrepancies, ongoing system audits, and user training. Moreover, the establishment of a Refurbishment Centre 
focused on quality control, sustainable practices, continuous monitoring, and performance metrics to ensure the 
integrity and efficiency of the refurbishment processes. Furthermore, adopting appropriate and customized storage 
and order policies will impact process performance (Al Jaberi, A., Amer, S. 2024). Overall, the Control phase aimed 
to solidify the advancements made, ensuring these systems not only meet but exceed operational expectations through 
continuous improvement and adaptation to changing demands.  
 
10. Conclusions 
The implementation of Lean Six Sigma methodologies within the utility company's inventory management processes 
has demonstrated substantial improvements across various metrics. Notably, the project has achieved significant 
reductions in lead times and operational costs, alongside improved customer satisfaction through more reliable service 
delivery. The successful application of tools such as Value Stream Mapping, various quality tools, and sophisticated 
forecasting techniques has set a precedent for continuous improvement within the company. Future initiatives will 
focus on further refining these processes and extending similar methodologies to other operational areas to sustain 
and enhance the gains achieved. This continuous improvement effort will ensure that the inventory management 
system remains robust and adaptable to changing demands and operational challenges (Gonzalez et al. 2016).

Abstract 
With digital transformation, physician review websites have also revolutionized the healthcare industry, which 
has significantly impacted patient consultation behavior by improving the service delivery process. Also, 
physician review websites offer substantial information on physician profiles, including operational attributes 
such as pre-process wait time and appointment slot duration, to reduce uncertainty regarding service. However, 
there is a paucity of research on pre-process wait time and appointment slot duration and its influence on patient 
preference for a physician in physician review websites. To bridge the gap, this study explores the influence of 
pre-process wait time and appointment slot duration on patient preference using the real-time physician review 
website dataset. The findings of this study reveal that pre-process wait time exhibits a U-shaped relationship with 
patient preference. Appointment slot duration has a positive influence on patient preference. This study highlights 
the moderation effect of appointment slot duration between pre-process wait time and patient preference. Our 
study advances online healthcare literature with theoretical and practical implications on wait time and 
appointment slot duration for healthcare service providers and managers.

1. Introduction
Digital transformation has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of business processes by utilizing big data, 
computing, communication, and connectivity technologies (Vial, 2019). This revolution has brought significant 
changes across various industries, including healthcare. In this era, online healthcare portals facilitate the way 
customers search and evaluate a healthcare service provider. Online healthcare portals provide a platform for 
matching patients with physicians for online and offline consultations (Ghosh et al., 2023). These portals are also 
known as physician review websites (PRWs) for online reporting of physician’s service quality (Chen & Lee, 
2024). After the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of these platforms has accelerated, and the global digital 
health market size is expected to reach $295 billion by 2028 (Xu et al., 2021). 
The patients receive information on PRWs and make informed decisions. However, the healthcare market is 
imperfect because of asymmetric information and uncertainty (Arrow, 1963). Also, healthcare services are highly 
credence and complex in nature, as it is challenging to determine service quality even after consumption. 
According to signaling theory, the information asymmetry and uncertainty between two parties can be diminished 
if one side is offering reliable information to the other through signals (Khurana et al., 2019). Wait time (WT) and 
appointment slot duration (ASD) are the two most critical operational attributes in healthcare services that 
determine patient satisfaction (Patterson et al., 2017). The unavailability of information on WT and ASD can 
significantly contribute to uncertainty about the healthcare service delivery process (Osuna,1985). In healthcare, 
WT is defined as the time duration between patient check-in and being seen by the physician (Patterson et al., 
2017). In the context of PRWs, it is also known as pre-processed WT because it is intimated to patients before 
booking the appointment (Noone & Lin, 2024). ASD is the total time spent with the patient in the examination 
room with the physician (Patterson et al., 2017). PRWs provide information on WT and ASD to reduce uncertainty 
and enhance patient satisfaction (Ghosh et al., 2023). However, extant literature on online healthcare communities 
has investigated the impact of various signals on patients' preferences (PP), such as online reviews, physician 
professional status, patient satisfaction ratings, physicians' education and experience, consultation fees, and profile 
picture (Ghosh et al., 2023; Khurana et al., 2019; Ouyang & Wang, 2022; Shah et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024),

Zhang et al., 2024). Second, this study attempts to extend the research on pre-process waiting time and service 
duration into the healthcare context and discuss the upside of waiting time (Noone & Lin, 2024). Finally, this 
study expands the application of signaling theory and counterfactual thinking in PRWs research.  
 
Regarding implications for practice, first, the findings of this study suggest that physicians with a low waiting 
time may signal that physicians are freshers and lack expertise. These physicians try to show more expertise-
related cues and service delivery-related information in their self-description section of the online profile. This 
will increase transparency about their service delivery process and competence and help them attract more 
patients. Second, physicians with lower ASD can increase the duration because patients' satisfaction increases 
with time spent with physicians in comprehensive diagnosis.  
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper explores the impact of pre-process WT and ASD and its influence on patient preference. The 
quantitative findings of this study highlight the significant impact of operational attributes on PP in the context of 
PRWs. The analysis confirms a U-shaped relationship between pre-process WT and PP, indicating that each 
additional minute of WT initially decreases the log of PP by 0.0238 minutes. However, WT squared suggests that 
as WT increases, the decrease in PP slows down and eventually reverses, leading to an increase in PP. This means 
that beyond a certain threshold, longer WTs can actually enhance PP, likely due to perceived physician quality 
and demand. ASD positively influences PP; this indicates that each additional minute of ASD increases the log of 
PP by 0.02257 minutes, highlighting the value patients place on comprehensive and thorough consultations. The 
interaction between WT and ASD is complex, indicating that WT*ASD means that for each additional minute of 
WT, the positive impact of each additional minute of ASD on the log of PP decreases by 0.00207 minutes. 
However, WT^2 *ASD indicates that as WT increases, the interaction effect with ASD becomes more positive, 
enhancing PP by 0.00004 for each squared minute of WT multiplied by ASD. This depicts a complex relationship 
that calls for further study, whether dividing wait time into categories or investigating this relationship according 
to disease specializations.   
 
Overall, the study provides robust quantitative evidence that operational attributes such as WT and ASD are 
crucial determinants of PP in PRWs. These findings offer valuable insights for healthcare providers aiming to 
optimize their service delivery to attract and retain patients in the digital healthcare environment. This study has 
several limitations; it considered a single PRW and country for the analysis, and further studies can consider 
multiple PRWs and other countries to examine the impact of variables in multiple geographies. Secondly, 
researchers may consider the interaction effect of hospital vs clinic settings for consultations; it may be possible 
that clinics are smaller settings with fewer facilities, and the perception of WT and ASD differs from hospitals. 
Lastly, there are many specialties divided into high-risk vs. low-risk diseases, and researchers can investigate 
whether the perception of WT and ASD changes as per the nature of the disease.

Abstract 
E-waste has become a global problem due to the containing of hazardous substances that limit landfill and incineration
disposal methods. It can be an opportunity for pyrolysis as a possible treatment method and energy recovery. This
research proposal is directed toward enhancing the understanding of the possibility and environmental effects of
pyrolysis, which is used for converting e-waste to energy. The investigation will incorporate suitable data analysis
systems, models, and processes that will help create accurate and reliable results. The selection of e-waste raw material
sample specimens will also be conducted in accordance with ethical and environmental guidelines that align with
corporate ecological exploration. The study will incorporate standardized guidelines to ensure it adheres to regulatory
principles of environmental governance. A data analysis and interpretation of this study for data will help determine
the most favorable condition for better energy recovery and less impact on the environment. The plan for the
implementation path regarding the responsible selection of high-risk waste-to-energy technologies will focus on
dealing with the regulatory framework, technology assessment, infrastructure development, and stakeholder
incorporation. The study sheds light on e-waste disposal policies and offers eco-friendly solutions for e-waste
management, decreasing resource wasting and pollution.

1. Introduction
E-waste, the waste generated by electronic devices, is among the rapidly growing environmental concerns as users
continue buying electronic devices on a large scale with a relatively shorter lifespan. The issue of proper e-waste
disposal is a serious threat to both the world and human health because it mainly contains dangerous elements like
heavy metals, PCBs, and BFRs (Guo et al., 2020). The legacy e-waste handling options, such as landfilling and
incineration, are incompatible with nature's sustainability and can even cause the release of toxic substances into
environmental settings like air, water, and soil.

method. The experiments will be performed systematically and in detail, aiming to obtain insights into the type of 
pyrolysis, the ecological potentials, and the energy output of this process. The approaches proposed in the research 
involve rigorous experimentation, state-of-the-art analytical methods, and thorough impact evaluations to ensure the 
production of the correct and high-quality data. Regarding research gaps and ethical, economic, and societal facets, 
the research will search for contributions toward more ethical and environmentally friendly approaches to e-waste 
disposal. At large, the effective deployment of pyrolysis for e-waste conversion will help create a closed-loop 
economy, reduce environmental impacts, and contribute to an array of sustainable energy generation alternatives. The 
results of this investigation are vital and can be very beneficial as they will provide the policymakers, industries, and 
other stakeholders with reliable information that will flawlessly guide them in making decisions regarding the choice 
of hazardous waste-to-energy technologies to be adopted.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the urge to utilize machine learning to build models to predict biomedical waste 
for futuristic waste management. In this study, the machine learning approach (Random Forest Regressor) is used to 
build a model that predicts biomedical waste weight generated based on the COVID-19 pandemic case. Data 
gathered during the period of COVID-19, which is specific to the United Arab Emirates and key features of the 
study were involved in the machine learning algorithm (PCR tests, vaccine doses, Masks, and Death Wraps). The 
generated model showed 92.67% accuracy, reflecting the overall predictive accuracy relative to the average 
biomedical waste observed. Pareto chart is used to identify which feature affects the overall generated biomedical 
waste; in this case, the model's initial prediction for a hypothetical scenario showed that around 2015.53 kg of the 
total biomedical waste is generated from PCR tests, whereas the least contributor was due to death wraps around 
41.13 kg. The model can predict a COVID-19 case like a pandemic that generates a huge amount of waste, with 
futuristic model improvements to include other vital features to the model's algorithms. The model has shown 
high accuracy which can be used in future pandemics to manage waste produced, especially medical waste.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has not only posed unprecedented challenges to global healthcare 
systems but has also significantly impacted waste management practices, particularly in the field of medical waste. 
Figure 1 shows the number of cases in GCC countries, vaccine doses, and deaths caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic (Mathieu 2020). The rapid growth in infectious medical waste, including personal protective equipment 
(PPE), masks, gloves, and other disposable materials, has strained existing waste management infrastructures 
worldwide. The United Arab Emirates has been no exception to this challenge with its strong healthcare sector 
and dynamic economy. As the UAE continues to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, effective management of 
pandemic-induced medical waste has become a critical priority for ensuring public health and environmental 
sustainability.

6. Conclusion 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in medical waste generated due to the heightened demand 
for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), testing supplies, and disposable medical equipment. Efforts were made 
to ensure the safe and efficient disposal of COVID-19-related medical waste. Therefore, many countries had to 
adapt to the increased volume of medical waste by implementing enhanced disposal practices. Machine learning 
can be used to build models that predict pandemics by analyzing various data sources such as previous pandemic 
data like patient's healthcare information, and the machine learning algorithm can identify patterns and trends that 
may indicate the emergence of a pandemic. In this work, a Random Forest Regressor model is used to model the 
COVID-19 pandemic, in which data is collected from the official COVID-19 dashboard of the UAE government 
(National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management, 2023). Then data is reprocessed for machine learning 
training that involves collecting recent data and scaling these numerical data. The features selection process 
included the weights of PCR tests, vaccines, masks, and death wraps, which were concluded to be the most used 
during the COVID-19 period. The importance Vs. The feature plot showed that the PCR test weight (kg) scored 
the highest in importance, corresponding to the availability of these tests during the COVID-19 period. The model 
also predicted that 6684.94 kg of biomedical waste would be generated in a COVID-19 case-like scenario while 
highlighting the contribution of PCR test weight in kg during the COVID-19 pandemic. The generated model can 
predict a similar case/pandemic in which the main variables/features are similar to the study in this paper, which 
was the main goal of this study, in which most medical treatments use masks and tests, and in later stages, vaccines 
will be developed. To conclude, the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged the utilization of machine learning when it 
comes to waste management by providing a predictive model for proper waste handling and disposal.

Broader Environmental and Economic Impacts 
Considering the rapid expansion of the solar energy sector, understanding the full lifecycle impact of PV 
technologies—including end-of-life management—is critical. Future studies should also examine the broader 
environmental and economic impacts of implementing large-scale recycling operations, including potential reductions 
in greenhouse gas emissions, energy usage in recycling processes, and the overall carbon footprint of solar energy. 
 
This expanded discussion offers a comprehensive view of the potential and challenges of recycling PV cells, 
highlighting the necessity for continued innovation and policy support to harness these technologies for sustainable 
waste management. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper examined the potential for recycling critical materials from photovoltaic (PV) cells, particularly within the 
context of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As the adoption of solar energy expands, the end-of-life waste from solar 
panels is projected to significantly increase, posing substantial waste management challenges. The study assesses the 
current production and material use in PV cells, anticipates the volume of waste generated, and discusses existing 
recycling efforts. It highlights the crucial need for advanced recycling technologies to efficiently reclaim valuable 
materials such as silicon, silver, and Indium from decommissioned solar panels. 
 
Based on the findings of this paper, it is recommended to develop Advanced Recycling Technologies within the UAE 
and to invest in research and development to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of recycling technologies. 
Focus on improving the recovery rates of critical materials like silicon, silver, and Indium, which are key components 
of PV cells not only from the solar panels waste generated from the UAE but also the solar panels waste generated 
from neighbor countries. 
It is recommended to implement regulatory frameworks and to establish and enforce regulations that mandate the 
recycling of materials from end-of-life PV cells. Such policies could include extended producer responsibility (EPR) 
requirements that hold manufacturers accountable for the disposal and recycling of solar panel waste. 
 
The implementation of policies shall be taking place with promoting industry collaboration. This takes place but 
encourage collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, and research institutions to share knowledge, 
technologies, and best practices in recycling processes. This could accelerate the adoption of effective recycling 
technologies across the solar energy sector. 
 
In addition, the UAE as a leading partner in IRENA can lead the process of having global standards and cooperation. 
This shall be by working towards establishing international standards for the recycling of PV cells to ensure 
consistency and effectiveness in waste management practices globally. International cooperation could also facilitate 
the exchange of innovative recycling technologies and strategies. 
 
An important role to establish a system of recycling PV cells is the public. Therefore, it is suggested to have public 
awareness and education. The increase public awareness about the importance of recycling PV cells and the potential 
environmental benefits. Educational programs could help cultivate a culture of sustainability and encourage the proper 
disposal of solar panel waste. 
 
Finally, the economic incentives as providing financial incentives such as subsidies, tax breaks, or grants to companies 
that invest in solar panel recycling facilities or adopt green manufacturing processes. This could make the recycling 
process more appealing and economically viable. 
These recommendations aim to enhance the recycling of critical materials from PV cells, thereby supporting 
environmental sustainability and reducing the ecological footprint of solar energy production. 
 
As global energy demands transition towards renewable sources, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is poised at the 
forefront of this shift with its significant investments in solar technology. However, this transition is accompanied by 
the burgeoning challenge of managing end-of-life photovoltaic (PV) cell waste, which is projected to see a dramatic 
increase over the coming decades. This paper has explored the current landscape of PV waste management and the 
feasibility of recycling critical materials within the UAE, reflecting broader global practices and technological 
advancements in this field.

The study underscores a critical need for robust recycling technologies that can effectively reclaim valuable materials 
such as silicon, silver, and Indium from decommissioned solar panels. While the current global efforts and emerging 
technologies show promise, particularly in the European Union and parts of Asia, there is a pressing need for localized 
strategies that cater to the specific environmental and industrial dynamics of the UAE. 
 
Conclusively, the sustainable management of solar panel waste not only addresses environmental concerns but also 
represents a significant economic opportunity for the recovery of precious materials. The UAE, with its strategic 
investments and policies, is well-positioned to lead by example in the innovation and implementation of effective 
waste management solutions. This will not only help mitigate the environmental impact of used PV cells but also 
bolster the economic viability of the renewable energy sector.

Abstract 
 Cyber Insurance (CI) is an important cyber risk management tool in industry and academia. Despite several 
commitments, its adoption rate is meagre. This research provides significant insights and analysis into the complex 
issues of i) identifying the key challenges in the cyber insurance (CI) market and ii) understanding how these 
influential challenges and their cause-effect relationships can inform policymakers to improve the CI ecosystem. An 
extensive literature review identified twenty-three challenges in the cyber insurance market. Industry experts in this 
field further validated these challenges, filtering them down to eleven major challenges for further analysis. The cause-
effect analysis of the challenges is determined using the fuzzy DEMATEL (FDEMATEL) approach. Finally, this 
study concludes that for a cyber insurance (CI) ecosystem to be successful, it is crucial to a) tackle the significant 
challenges posed by the cascading effects of correlated cyber risks and b) ensure the active participation of Chief 
Information Security Officers (CISOs) to grasp the CI value chain.

1. Introduction and Literature Review
The development of information technology reduces business costs and operation time but enhances information 
security risks at an unexpected level. In order to protect themselves from cyber risks, organizations are implementing 
various information security controls. However, complete mitigation of those cyber risks is not feasible. There was 
always an element of risk that cannot be mitigated. (Marotta et al. 2017.;Pal et al. 2014.;OECD. 2017) CI is designed 
to transfer those residual risks to a third party i.e., the insurer (Bohme 2005) . Despite several commitments, the CI 
adoption rate is abysmal (Meland et al. 2015;Eling, M., and Schnell,W. 2016.). Several studies have investigated the 
various barriers in the cyber insurance market, focusing on specific contexts such as small and medium businesses, 
geography-specific rules and regulations, and specific business scenarios (Meland et al. 2015;Woods, D., and Simpson 
2017). However, an exhaustive literature review revealed a lack of comprehensive studies on the major challenges in 
the cyber insurance market. To address this research gap, this study formulated the following research questions. RQ1: 
What are the primary challenges confronting the present cyber insurance market? RQ2: How can the correlation

5. Discussion 
Table 5 indicates that C1, C2, C4, C5, C6 and C7 are identified as cause alternatives, all characterized by a positive 
value when considering the difference (ri-ci) (Lin 2013). Moreover, these cause alternatives can be divided further into 
subgroups when looking at their prominence values (ri+ci), categorizing the challenges from a spectrum of low to 
high. C7 (The cascading effect of correlated cyber risk) is ranked high in prominence and scored as rank one. C4 and 
C5 also have significant prominence values (7.9816 and 8.148 consecutively) and also have causal influence power 
towards others' challenges.   Out of 11 interaction effects, six positive (ri-ci) values are identified as a causal group, 
and the remaining five have negative (ri+ci) values.  
 
On the other hand, out of 11 interaction effects, C3, C8, C9, C10 and  C11 fall under the effect group. The effect group 
is represented by the negative values of (ri-ci) (Lin 2013,Patil and Kant 2012). These are less influential in influencing 
others and are affected by cause group elements. C10 and C11 are getting maximum influenced by the causal group 
of elements. Hence, it is evident that the challenges of “High premium prices” and “Delays in the claim settlement 
process” are the worst consequences of the causal effect. These have a moderate prominence value (8.160 and 7.785, 
respectively) and are scored as rank 3 and rank 7, respectively. 
 
Considering the acceptable range of values (Above threshold values), the elements in the total relation matrix in Table 
6 are given three types of coloured shades, signifying different levels of interaction. It results in the following 
interaction effects: weak (red; values ranging from .3584 to .4096), moderate (yellow; values ranging from .4097 to 
.4608) and strong (green; values ranging from .4609 to .5119). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study employs Fuzzy DEMATEL analysis to reveal major challenges hindering the adoption/ecosystem of CI. 
Although this study revealed that the Cascading effect of correlated cyber risk (C7) and the Underrated value chain 
1353","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

(C5) are the influential components, the role of higher management remains crucial. The study's findings indicate that 
the absence of standardization in component C3 is insignificant as it does not exceed the threshold value. Therefore, 
additional research and insights from experts are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of C3. This fuzzy DEMATEL 
approach has better cause-effect analyzing power compared to other well-accepted methods like structural equation 
modelling. This study significantly measured the relationship between the current CI market's challenges. The findings 
of this work will help cyber insurance providers, regulatory bodies, and policymakers to minimize the challenges and 
to build a better CI ecosystem. However, this work, like other research, has some limitations. A more significant 
number of experts may reveal some other challenges. Hence, future work can be done with a larger number of expert's 
opinions.

Abstract 
The present research is intended to investigate the concept of lean thinking in managing of supply chains with a 
specific focus on technical theoretical models and frameworks based on Industry 4.0 technologies. To create value, it 
is important in identification of steps required to value, mapping of the value stream and creation of rapid sequence 
steps for value creation as well as elimination of excessive material handling steps and reduce inefficiencies. This 
research adopts a methodological framework based on a hybrid model consisting of two proposed and existing

1. Introduction
The application of lean thinking in supply chains typically entails the improvement of the involved processes based 
on the concepts of waste reduction, process simplification, and optimal value creation. The basic premise of lean 
thinking is the production of more value using fewer resources while providing the end-customer with the intended 
quality of the end-product (Vanichchinchai, 2019). The primary objective of lean supply chains is to produce an almost 
exact quantity of needed products, at the time needed, and where it is needed (Garcia-Buendia et al., 2021; Yu and 
Te, 2023). In the creation of value, lean supply chains determine the value system through the identification of steps 
required for value, mapping of the value stream, and creation of rapid sequence steps for value creation. In terms of 
waste reduction, the technique aims to stop defective products, eliminate excessive material handling steps, and reduce 
time wasted (Reyes et al., 2023; Cvetić et al., 2023). In this regard, lean supply chains focus on improving value-
adding activities that can transform materials into end-products that the customer is willing to pay for while reducing

In terms of elements associated with the LSCM 4.0, the supply chain flows are based on a framework that consists of 
three interrelated sub-elements, including the network of the supply chain, which involves different stakeholders such 
as customers, producers, and suppliers; the supply chain business processes, which include techniques such as agile 
manufacturing and just-in-time (JIT); and, lastly, the supply chain management, which involves the relationship 
between the stakeholders and the applied management practices. According to the findings, the integration of the 
supply chain network, processes, and management with lean thinking practices based on Industry 4.0 technologies 
ensures the integration of the flow of information, materials, products, and finance with the different stakeholders, 
which ensures seamless supply chain operations. 
 
Secondly, in terms of risk management, the adoption of lean thinking practices in supply chains can be crucial in 
addressing existing constraints and challenges such as lack of strategic vision, lack of competent personnel, and lack 
of understanding of Industry 4.0 technologies, which pose significant challenges for the supply chain system. In 
essence, therefore, lean practices can be considered as standard indicators of weaknesses in supply chain operations 
and deliveries. 
 
Also, in relation to lean design, the findings show that the application of lean thinking principles provides the perfect 
opportunities for improvement of system flow through the elimination of non-added value, management of stakeholder 
relationships, and management of technological aspects of the supply chain. 
 
Lastly, the technological structure of the LSCM techniques provides useful information on the highly complex and 
automated manufacturing systems, services, and business processes that are applicable for ensuring optimal supply 
chain operations. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Research Directions 
The primary objective of lean thinking principles in supply chains is to produce an almost exact quantity of needed 
products, at the time needed, and where it is needed. In the creation of value, lean supply chains determine the value 
system through the identification of steps required for value, mapping of the value stream, and creation of rapid 
sequence steps for value creation. The success of the application of these techniques is reliant on the sincerity of the 
relationship, which can further lead to the development of conflicts among the stakeholders of interest within the 
supply chains since most of the relationships are often adversarial rather than collaborative. There are theoretical 
models and frameworks that relate lean thinking principles with supply chains, and most of them focus on improving 
the relationship between the involved stakeholders to enhance value and eliminate waste. The present study provided 
an analytical review of existing literature on lean thinking in supply chain management with a specific focus on 
technical theoretical models and frameworks based on Industry 4.0 technologies and added to the existing literature 
on the research topic regarding the efficiency of supply chain management based on lean thinking principles. 
 
The research findings show that supply chain flows, technological structure, risk management, and lean manufacturing 
practices are crucial elements of lean thinking principles in supply chain management. These elements play an 
important role in various aspects of supply chains within an organization, including logistics, suppliers, collaborative 
management, strategic decision making, production, and marketing. Based on the results, it can be hypothesized that 
the integration of the supply chain network, processes, and management with lean thinking practices based on Industry 
1361","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
4.0 technologies ensures the integration of the flow of information, materials, products, and finance with the different 
stakeholders, which ensures seamless supply chain operations. Based on the findings, there is a high accuracy for 
measuring the efficiency of the supply chain system. Therefore, there should be a focus on further enhancing the 
accuracy of the model to provide near-exact simulation-based forecasts for supply chain systems based on the value 
of the efficiency factor.

Abstract 
This article seeks to establish how lean thinking has become a game-changer in enhancing operational excellence 
across various industries. Lean thinking, which originated in the Toyota production system, has evolved into a 
more general set of concepts for businesses. Among the lean manufacturing principles, value, value stream, flow, 
pull, and continuous improvement remain central to eliminating waste, increasing efficiency, and improving the 
value delivered to customers. This research focuses on both lean methodologies and lean tools such as Value 
Stream Mapping, 5S, Kaizen, Just-In-Time, Poka-Yoke, and Kanban. Practical examples and real-life cases 
demonstrate how lean thinking has provided substantial benefits in terms of waste elimination, product quality 
improvement, productivity rates, customer satisfaction, cost reduction, and employee motivation. However, the 
application of lean thinking is not without challenges, which may include resistance due to a lack of understanding, 
cultural barriers, and difficulties in measurement, among others. This analysis addresses these challenges and 
offers techniques for overcoming them and achieving successful lean transformation. The aim of this analysis is 
to distill insights from both the conceptual and managerial contexts of lean thinking that may be useful to 
organizations seeking operational excellence, cost reduction, and sustainable competitive advantage in today's 
challenging and highly competitive world. 
Keywords 
Lean Thinking, Operational Excellence, Waste Reduction, Continuous Improvement, Customer-Centricity. 
1. Introduction
In a modern world characterized by intense and ever-growing competition, business success is distinguished by 
one's ability to operate efficiently. Operational excellence is defined as the state of enduring high performance in 
organizations, catalyzed by regular optimization of key processes and consistent responsiveness to customer needs 
(Carvalho et al., 2020). It is not only specific to the task but also a concept that includes the optimality of creating 
as much value for the organization as possible and cutting costs from all angles within the organization. 
The core of operation management is lean thinking, a global movement and a set of practices that have changed 
the face of economic performance (Smith A, 2015). Born out of what is referred to as the Toyota Production 
System or lean manufacturing, lean thinking originated in the post-World War II Japanese automobile industry 
(Toyota Motor Corporation, 2023). Toyota's gripping story of consistent growth since its post-war beginnings, 
particularly founded on the organization's commitment to a unique management philosophy, namely, the 
elimination of waste and improvement of productive efficiency, drew the interest of businesses globally (Toyota 
1363","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
 
part of the lean transformation. Such measurements are useful when carried out routinely, as they supply vital 
information and a reality check on the lean change process. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Lean thinking is a great example of how the various ideas and strategies of operative improvement and focusing 
on customer needs help to build up the environment for success. Its principles and methodologies are portable 
across organizations and have revolutionized industries by improving efficiency, effecting productivity and 
innovation, and minimizing cost. There are some obstacles in the implementation of such practices, but if 
leaders of organizations provide their subordinates with the proper training and encourage them to work on the 
formation of a new organizational culture, the problems under consideration will be solvable. 
 
The incorporation of lean as a digital concept along with sustainability shows that lean is a concept that remains 
relevant in the contemporary business environment. In an ever-competing and increasing transitional 
environment, lean thinking gives organizations an upper hand, thus directing them to a confirmed successful 
way of operating. Due to its focus on continuous change and the implementation of keen customer satisfaction, 
Lean is optimistic that it will remain a competency strength in management operations in the future.

Increased Efficiency: Lean Thinking helps to eradicate non-value creating activities and waste that enhance the 
operational effectiveness and efficiency of an organization. A fundamental lean principle known as Just-in-Time 
(JIT) production keeps inventory to a minimum while products and resources are acquired at the time they are 
required. It helps to cut the storage costs of excess stock and provide better acknowledgment of customers' 
requests. For instance, the MDPI journal research on production economics has confirmed that the application of 
JIT cut the production lead time and cost by over 70%. 
 
Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: Customer focus is created in Lean as it is oriented towards the understanding 
and creation of the value of the goods and services provided to customers. Because of a system that seeks to 
identify customer needs and preferences and a systematic approach that strives to have the right products ready at 
the right time, lean organizations possess thorough means that would enable them to meet and deliver more than 
the expectations of their customers. For example, the introduction of lean in a hospital led to decreased patient 
waiting time and enhanced communication, along with a positive score of patient satisfaction. 
 
Cost Reduction: The continuous outcomes in waste reduction, enhancements in quality, and increases in efficiency 
result in considerable cost savings. All types of waste, particularly those found in the lean system, including stocks 
on hand, wasteful processes, and flawed products, are great costs to the firm (Milewski, 2022). When quality is 
enhanced, it leads to less demand for inspections and rework, which are expensive exercises; therefore, it reduces 
costs. Efficiency increases result in resources being used optimally, leading to lower costs. 
 
Employee Engagement: Lean Thinking also covers aspects of employee involvement, improvement, and 
knowledge sharing. This is well exemplified in the Kaizen business management system, where everyone in the 
business organization is encouraged to provide and participate in improvement initiatives. It not only promotes 
the spirit of the employees' involvement and responsibility in their work but also utilizes their experience and 
ideas, which in turn creates creativity and a high morale among them. A survey of a service organization's 
experience revealed that lean methods boosted employee contentment and organizational performance by over 
50% (Schwantz et al., 2023). Those businesses that adopt lean thinking as their management values can be 
considered to be on the right track towards gaining a competitive advantage in a world economy that is becoming 
progressively more challenging. 
 
5. Implementation Challenges  
It is equally important to note that lean thinking does not come without its challenges. One of the challenges for 
change management is resistance to change, which is usually caused by several factors, some of which are fear of 
the unknown or threats from change processes to already existing practices (Primeast, 2020). This can be 
counteracted through intervention that comprises achieving extensive leadership, communication, and 
accomplishment of change through engaging the employees. Likewise, one should stress the advantages of lean 
and explain doubts that may arise while implementing lean; this generates ownership and increases interest in the 
transformation process. 
 
The other major issue is the general misunderstanding of Lean concepts and practices. The issues and 
recommendations of Lean go beyond the mere use of operational tools and practices and are a complete system 
of management thought. To facilitate the use of lean thinking at the workplace, extensive training and education 
procedures are necessary in order to provide employees with the necessary knowledge and skills. It covers the 
philosophy with regards to particular approaches such as VSM, 5S, the Kaizen methodology, and others, while 
developing a conceptual approach to continuous improvement and elimination of waste. 
 
There are also institutional factors that can hinder lean adoption; these are cultural issues (Zimmermann and 
Bollbach, 2015). This is because certain organizational cultures may not easily embrace the changes that Lean 
brings with it, including the utilization of employees and their collaboration, as well as the constant striving for 
perfection. Of these cultural barriers, it is crucial to address leadership commitment, cultural surveys, and change 
strategies to integrate the organization's culture with Lean. This may include such practices as reducing certain 
hierarchical barriers to communication, rewarding risk-taking, and acknowledging the part played by workers in 
the process of change. 
 
Lastly, the assessment and monitoring of the lean principles' effectiveness are also necessary for implementation. 
The development of relevant and specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are in line with Lean's goals 
allows companies to assess the alterations, reinforce good working practices, and recognize achievements. The 
KPIs can be defined as key performance indicators that encompass lead time reduction, inventory turnover, the 
rate of defects, and the customers' satisfaction ratings (Lara et al., 2023). These are actualizations that should form

Abstract 
 Lathe machines are a technological advancement involved in cutting and shaping materials and are widely used 
across several industries. However, many injuries and fatalities arise due to the improper handling of the machine 
and its malfunction. A range of safety approaches have been developed to reduce incidents from training to P.P.E. 
Nevertheless, incidents still occur due to the unpredictability of the machine's function and human error. In our 
approach to taking on this issue, we proposed a system that identifies potential accidents through computer vision 
and records potential risks in real time with the help of a deep learning model. Based on previous studies, our 
proposed method shows great potential in the advancement of health and safety measures to reduce on-site damage 
to equipment and personnel.

1. Introduction
A lathe machine, a cornerstone in the world of manufacturing and engineering, is designed for shaping and 
machining various materials, including metal, wood, and plastic. By rotating the workpiece on its axis against cutting 
tools, lathes allow for precise and intricate shaping, making them indispensable in the production of symmetrical 
objects and parts. Despite their utility, operating these machines comes with inherent risks. Accidents involving 
lathes, often resulting from unsafe working conditions or equipment malfunctions, can lead to severe injuries, 
fatalities, and substantial material losses (Bureau of Labor Statistics,2020). 
Recent statistics highlight the gravity of this issue: Also, in 2020, machinery and equipment-related fatalities 
constituted 15% of total fatalities in the United States (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2020). Analyzing the data 
regarding accidents and diseases in working industries, it is worth mentioning that the primary causes were machines, 
at least in terms of mining significance (U.S. Mining Industry Report, 2010). Perhaps one of the most discussed 
pieces of equipment in this regard is the lathe. For example, there have been a lot of reports on how lathe accidents 
happen frequently, which calls for a strong and efficient organization to avoid them. This report is concerned with 
the assessment of the key operational variables for lathe machines, identification of trends in the control systems, 
and evaluation of the measures that can be taken to minimize the risks of accidents in order to improve the safety 
and performance of these machines. The full adoption of Artificial Intelligence solutions in safety measures could 
have the potential of changing safety measures through real-time surveillance and the use of Artificial intelligence 
to predict accidents before they happen (Weerasinghe et al., 2012).

database of photographs of workers and lathe machines for object detection. 
 
4.3 Deep Learning Model 
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that processes patterns from visual content and 
is especially useful in computer vision applications (Mandal, 2023). To utilize this model, important features will first 
be extracted from the database created using image capturing, including posture, joint angles, motion patterns, speed 
of movements, distance from potential hazards, lathe machine parts, and the presence of safety hazards. Such features 
will be annotated with labels to indicate whether the practices are normal or deviated and to categorize worker's 
performance. The labeled data will be input into the CNN model land and will be randomly divided into training and 
testing sets. To detect movement and proximity (operator and machine) for hazard evaluation, the coordinates of the 
objects obtained from the model will be used. The deep learning model will be integrated into the monitoring system 
using a Software Development Kit (SDK) interface (Liu et al. 2019), and the surveillance will then be assessed for 
abnormalities in real-time. 
 
4.4 Alert Mechanism 
 Severity levels of abnormal behaviors will be identified based on the categorization of the worker's performance, 
and warning alerts will be generated depending on the level of the risk conditions (Table 1). The abnormal behavior 
may be less severe, in which case the alert can be displayed on a dashboard or a monitor within the operator's vision 
as flash warnings and as sound alerts to enhance the attraction of the operator. In the case of severe danger, the 
machine may have an emergency shutdown mechanism whereby the machine's operation will be halted to prevent 
the occurrence of an accident.

Conclusion 
Due to the high prevalence of injuries (nonfatal and fatal) whilst operating on lathe machines, it is necessary to take 
proactive safety measures to prevent such incidents. Our proposed method involves predicting and preventing injuries 
by utilizing deep learning and computer vision to identify unsafe acts, record the act in real-time, and generate an alert 
to notify the worker of a potential hazard. Moreover, this information can be used for training and educational 
purposes, furthering the safety of the workers involved. Based on the high accuracy of the model demonstrated by 
Luoetal., our model shows great potential to be applied by management-site; however, a multidisciplinary team is 
required to fully implement the strategy while paying more attention to the details of the model's logarithm.

Abstract 
Effective Improvement the loan portfolio is crucial for banks as it directly influences their profitability and overall 
performance. Effective Improvement allows banks to achieve greater diversification, enhance asset quality, and 
improve liquidity management. Profitability and liquidity risk management of this portfolio are influenced by 
several factors, with the budget allocated to each product being one of the most significant. This budget directly 
impacts profitability and customer satisfaction. The product budget refers to the maximum loan amount that the 
bank offers to customers for each product. In this research, we aim to create an appropriate portfolio of bank loan 
products by analyzing the behavior of loan applicants and determining the budget ceiling for each product. Our 
objective is to meet the diverse needs of our customers, including the amount and variety of loans, while 
maximizing profitability. To achieve this goal, we employ a fourth-step approach. First, we analyze customer 
behavior and create a simulation model to determine the budget ceiling increase for each product. Second, due to the 
large number of scenarios, we use the design of experiments approach to select and evaluate a subset of scenarios 
using the simulation model. Subsequently, we employ a neural network approach to assess the remaining scenarios. 
Finally, we develop a mathematical model for the optimal allocation of funds to different products, resulting in the 
formation of the optimal product portfolio. The results of the proposed approach, compared to the bank's 
performance last year, demonstrate average improvements of 9.2% in profitability and 8.7% in customer 
satisfaction, underscoring the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of lean tools in the improvement of warehouses in terms of reducing 
costs and waste in a warehouse. After the determination of waste, specific lean tools were used to reduce waste and 
improve the performance of the warehouse. To evaluate the warehouse efficiency, value stream mapping, 
benchmarking, and activity profiling were used. The combination of these three tools facilitates the identification of 
waste in the warehouse that would have been challenging to identify using only one tool. As a solution to reduce lead 
time and non-value-added activities in the warehouse, various lean tools including 5S and visual management were 
implemented. The main critical issue in applying lean is to sustain the work and to sustain the idea of continuous 
improvement, hence employees’ training was key in improvement. A future state map was conducted after applying 
lean tools, it was concluded that the lead time has decreased by 25%, and non-value-added activities time was reduced 
by 33% in various operations such as loading, receiving, storage, inspection, and order picking.

1. Introduction
In their book, ‘Lean Thinking’, Womack et al. (1996) introduced the lean production philosophy to the Western world. 
According to them, lean thinking entails the following: defining value, aligning value-added tasks in the optimal 
sequence, and performing these activities uninterrupted. To achieve this, it is very important to follow the main 
principles of lean thinking introduced by Womack et al.: 
•
Specify value from the customer’s point of view.
•
Map all the product’s value streams.
•
Design flow within the organization.
•
Manufacture based on the customer’s need (establish pull).
•
Seek perfection.
Warehouses play a significant part in the logistics system of any company. Companies use warehouses as a source of 
time and space to deliver raw resources, work-in-progress, and final outputs. It consists of multiple processes including 
receiving, storing, and shipping of the products or items. The activities of a warehouse include the receipt and

Taking the financial constraints into account, the optimal solution for implementing lean tools in the warehouse was 
to use low-cost resources such as board, colored papers, cleaning tools, and pins. Another limitation to apply lean 
concepts in the warehouse is availability of different resources such as time and workers. It was difficult to apply lean 
tools in the whole warehouse in the project duration. Moreover, it was difficult to apply all steps of 5S in all the 
locations, as it required a larger number of workers and more material handling equipment. Humans and other errors 
are responsible for various errors in the current and future construction of value stream mapping. The duration of each 
process was recorded multiple times for more accuracy.  
 
6. Conclusions 
In this work, lean manufacturing tools were used for improvement in a warehouse of a large retail company specialized 
in electronics and accessories. VSM, activity profiling, and benchmarking were utilized throughout the evaluation 
procedure. The current state of value stream mapping gives a snapshot of the situation in the warehouse with all the 
required processes. It identifies where materials and items are in storage, where overproduction occurs, and how many 
personnel are engaged in various activities. However, The VSM will not provide a massive data set detailing, for 
example, how consumers order from warehouses or whether products are frequently requested together. Activity 
Profiling accomplishes this, which was a crucial consideration when selecting this concept for this study. Both cannot 
define the warehouse's performance, so benchmarking was used with various KPIs to measure the warehouse's 
performance based on standards as determined by the gap analysis. The model used in this research combines TPS, 
kaizen, HRM, and quality management. This model has features that make it highly pertinent to warehouse systems; 
it is extensive in design, simple to implement in a variety of warehouse types, and useful in the warehouse evaluation 
process. The aim is to use a model to apply lean in warehouse and use this model as a study resource in workshops 
conducted to explain the lean concepts to workers. The proposed implemented changes could reduce lead time by 
25%, reduce Non-value added time by 33%, and reducing WIP by 30%.

Abstract 
Manufacturing defect mitigation focuses on identifying the causes of defects and reducing their occurrence by 
adjusting process configurations. This requires the development of a smart decision-making system that can assist in 
self-configuration and self-optimization of a production line. To achieve this, this paper proposes a case-based domain 
knowledge modeling and reasoning approach for cognitive intelligent defect mitigation using knowledge graphs and 
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). Unlike conventional case-based reasoning, the proposed approach employes 
knowledge graph database for knowledge modeling and case representation, enhancing the efficiency of case retrieval. 
Additionally, the large-language model (LLM) is employed to assist in knowledge acquisition and knowledge 
reasoning for case adaptation. An example of defect mitigation in an assembly line with in-process inspection is 
presented to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

1. Introduction
Since the advent of Industry 4.0, manufacturing industries have been continuously integrating cutting-edge 
technologies into various applications, creating a more dynamic and complex manufacturing environment. New 
characteristics have emerged within the manufacturing system, including high-precision manufacturing, high-mix 
low-volume manufacturing, self-configuration, self-optimization, and so on. During production, manufacturing 
inspection plays an important role in ensuring product quality by identifying defective parts. Additionally, inspection 
aids in process control by mitigating defect generation through a manufacturing-inspection-mitigation control loop. 
This self-configuration process, known as defect mitigation, involves mitigation planning to adjust process 
configurations which produce defect parts by inferencing inspection results (Borish et al., 2019).  
1.1 Manufacturing Defect Mitigation 
In the manufacturing industry, defect mitigation encompasses the methodologies and tactics aimed at minimizing, 
controlling, and eradicating defects in products, systems, and processes. This approach is pivotal in enhancing the 
efficiency and sustainability of manufacturing operations (Psarommatis et al., 2021). Advanced data-driven 
technologies are instrumental in this context, facilitating real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance, which are 
essential for effective defect mitigation. The implementation of robust data management systems is crucial as it ensures 
the accuracy and usability of data for defect detection and classification (Thung et al., 2012). Research underscores 
the importance of a strong data management system and effective information management in achieving successful 
defect mitigation (Woo & O’Connor, 2021).

8. Concluding Remarks 
This paper has presented a novel approach to manufacturing defect mitigation through cognitive intelligent case-based 
reasoning, utilizing generative AI and knowledge graphs. The proposed approach is validated with a case of ultrasonic 
welding defect mitigation for its feasibility and effectiveness.  
 
There are several contributions of this paper. Firstly, by leveraging LLMs for knowledge acquisition and inference, 
the proposed system offers a robust solution for defect detection and mitigation in dynamic and complex 
manufacturing environments. Secondly, the integration of knowledge graphs also enhances the efficiency of 
knowledge modeling, facilitating case representation and retrieval. Thirdly, case adaptation is enhanced through a 
RAG application, increasing the flexibility of case-based reasoning. In conclusion, the proposed cognitive intelligent 
case-based reasoning approach not only works in the field of manufacturing defect mitigation but can be applied to 
other applications to improve reasoning quality and efficiency.

Abstract 
Urban rideshares have become a cornerstone of urban transportation, offering unparalleled convenience and presenting 
a significant market opportunity. However, safety concerns are escalating as their usage proliferates. By harnessing 
advancements in computer vision and mobile technologies, alongside the widespread adoption of shared vehicles, 
urban rideshare systems can now deliver real-time road information and safety advisories. A critical gap remains in 
predictive capabilities and the translation of image data into human-understandable language or actionable safety 
recommendations. This paper investigates the potential of creating a real-time generative AI-based intelligent 
cognitive assistant for updating road information, specifically designed for urban rideshare safety recommendation 
services. Utilizing computer vision to collect road data during rides, the platform employs a generative AI database to 
comprehensively store and analyze this information. Users receive immediate safety updates through intuitive 
interfaces using a retrieval-augmented generation system. To demonstrate the ICA’s viability, a test case of shared e-
scooters is studied, showcasing the system's effectiveness and potential impact on urban scooter rideshare safety. This 
test case highlights how the GAI-based ICA can enhance the safety and reliability of urban rideshare services by 
providing timely and accurate safety information and recommendations.

1. Introduction
The rideshare system is widely used in urban environments, providing convenience for daily public life and 
representing a significant market opportunity. Service providers such as Citi Bike, Lime, and Bird quickly achieved a 
strong service-market fit, reaching billion-dollar valuations shortly after their inception (Ma et al. 2021). Ensuring the 
safety of riders is paramount for both the users and the rideshare companies. Much research has focused on this area, 
examining data analysis aspects (Zakhem and Colin 2024) and policy regulation analysis (Riggs et al. 2021). However, 
practical methods for real-life applications to monitor road conditions and provide safety suggestions are still limited. 
With recent advancements in computer vision technology, numerous methods have been developed to monitor road 
conditions. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained on pavement images to create deep 
learning models that provide detailed information on road conditions (Zhang et al. 2016). Mobile device cameras, 
being highly accessible and convenient, can be combined with computer vision technologies to become powerful and 
easy-to-use tools for daily applications. Modern computer vision technology has leveraged data from simple sensors 
in cell phones, employing methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for 
model training (Ashqar et al. 2020). Therefore, with the help of computer vision technologies and modern mobile 
device sensors, road safety conditions and traffic information can be effectively gathered and analyzed. However,

6. Rideshare Safety Recommendation Chatbot Interface 
After setting up the database and RAG system, a final chatbot interface is essential for providing user feedback. The 
chatbot retrieves safety information from the database and offers safety suggestions based on the calculated safety 
score. Once a real-time image is provided and the safety score is calculated, the chatbot automatically generates and 
displays the safety suggestions to the user. This interface ensures users receive timely and relevant safety information 
in an easily accessible manner. Figure 9 shows an example of the user interface. 
 
7. Conclusions 
This paper proposes the GenICA as a new concept designed to generate road safety information and test its feasibility. 
The GenICA, embedded with a knowledge graph database and generative algorithms for information retrieval, has 
been examined and compared to traditional online recommendation systems. The GenICA provides users with 
enhanced situational awareness and serves as a reference for self-generation. It offers deeper insights into data features 
for designers monitoring the system, highlighting the generative capabilities of the model. The GenICA allows for the 
generative application of industrial knowledge, showcasing its potential to improve road safety and provide valuable 
information to both users and designers. 
 
However, there are limitations to this approach. One significant issue is hallucination, where large language models 
generate incorrect or misleading answers. This can result in significantly wrong advice being provided during riding, 
even when performing the same function or building the same model. To mitigate this, more specific knowledge 
should be generalized and standardized to minimize discrepancies. Additionally, real-life environmental conditions 
are crucial to consider, as real traffic is more complex and can dramatically affect the analysis process, potentially 
causing instability. Therefore, future work should focus on training the model with more specific knowledge and 
refining the learning process to enhance its reliability and accuracy.

Abstract 
This paper explores the application of a robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning to 
enhance the precision and efficiency of object manipulation tasks. Leveraging OpenAI’s GPT-4o image recognition 
model along with OpenCV, we implement smart computer vision techniques to accurately recognize, locate, and 
manipulate targeted objects. By automating control and minimizing human intervention, our approach has the potential 
for improving traditional kinematics-based methods. The integration of AI enables robots to learn from vision data, 
adapt to various scenarios, and improve over time. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing AI and deep 
learning to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in robot manipulation, with profound implications for manufacturing 
automation and beyond.

1. Introduction
Robot manipulation refers to the ability of a robot to interact with objects in its environment, typically through the use 
of a robotic arm or end-effector (gripper, tool, etc.). This involves a range of tasks such as grasping, moving, placing, 
and assembling objects. Robot manipulation is a crucial aspect of robotics because it enables robots to perform 
complex tasks that require precision, dexterity, and adaptability. Robot manipulation is a cornerstone of manufacturing 
automation, enabling the development of sophisticated and efficient automated systems that can perform a wide range 
of tasks with high precision and reliability (Anderson and Kurez, 2024). 
With this problem in mind, we explore the application of a robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and 
deep learning to recognize, locate, and manipulate targeted objects. The release of OpenAI’s GPT-4 model has 
significantly advanced computer vision capabilities, allowing for seamless access through simple prompts. Its 
enhanced contextual and language understanding surpasses the limitations and rigidity of previous vision models. This 
benefit enables the GPT model to be utilized in a variety of scenarios, reducing the need for programs to be specifically 
tailored to a single use case (Liu et al., 2021). 
This research is motivated by the need to improve efficiency and precision in robot manipulation. Manual calibration 
of robot control not only consumes valuable time but also introduces the possibility of human error. By automating 
these tasks, we aim to minimize errors, increase throughput, and equip robot manipulation with vision-based 
intelligence. The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning neural networks in robot 
manipulation presents many advantages over traditional kinematics-based methods (Liu et al., 2024). AI enables 
robots to learn from vision data, adapt to new use cases, and improve their performance over time as more valid data 
is used for self-training throughout their lifespan. Deep learning, a subset of AI, allows for the development of

compared to the two-step model. Both models implement our smart robot control strategy powered by GPT Vision. 
The all-in-one model treats smart robot control as a pure machine learning problem, overlooking the domain-specific 
context. In contrast, the two-step model enhances performance by integrating domain knowledge. This aligns with the 
consensus on the hallucination problem of LLMs’ in that they struggle with understanding cause-and-effect 
relationships and logical flow, for which domain knowledge matters.

7. Concluding Remarks 
By harnessing OpenAI’s GPT-4o model in conjunction with computer vision capabilities like OpenCV, this study 
illustrates great potential in object recognition, localization, and manipulation within robotic arm systems. The GPT-
powered smart robot control approach not only automates manual calibration processes but also reduces errors, 
enhances throughput, and enhances adaptability to diverse environments. By integrating AI and deep learning, robots 
can autonomously learn from visual data, continually improving their performance over time. This represents a 
promising shift towards more intelligent and efficient automated manufacturing. These findings highlight the 
transformative potential of AI in robotics, offering extensive applications across various industrial sectors beyond 
traditional kinematics-based methods.

Abstract 
This research explores the application of the Sustainability Triangle in the development of forest city to address 
critical environmental challenges facing modern urban areas, with a special focus on the development of forest city 
in Indonesia's new capital city (IKN). Forest cities integrate extensive vegetation into the urban environment, 
offering an effective ecological solution while providing significant economic and social benefits. By improving air 
quality through the absorption of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, urban forests contribute to a healthier urban 
atmosphere. Additionally, urban vegetation helps reduce the urban heat island effect by lowering surface 
temperatures and reducing energy requirements for cooling. Urban forests also function as habitats for various flora 
and fauna, increasing biodiversity and ecological balance. Analysis carried out on existing urban forest projects at 
IKN, highlights the important role of commitment and collaboration between government, the private sector, local 
communities, and research institutions in the success of these initiatives. Policy recommendations, such as 
increasing community participation, adopting environmentally friendly technologies, diversifying plant species, and 
developing supportive policies, aim to strengthen and optimize the implementation of urban forests. This research 
makes a significant contribution to the academic literature and practice of sustainable urban development, 
demonstrating that the forest city concept is an effective and comprehensive approach to addressing urban 
environmental challenges. It is hoped that the sustainable development and implementation of this concept can 
create future cities that are more environmentally friendly, economically competitive, and socially prosperous.

1. Introduction
Sustainability has become an important issue in global development in the economic, environmental, and social 
sectors. Sustainability challenges are increasingly prominent in the context of urban development, requiring 
strategic planning and implementation to balance economic growth, environmental conservation, and social welfare 
(Kleine & von Hauff, 2009). Amid these dynamics, the ambitious project for Indonesia's new capital or Indonesian 
National Capital (IKN) has emerged as the focus of attention. The Indonesian government has ambitious plans to 
develop a new capital city (IKN) with a forest city concept, which aims to mitigate environmental damage, 
especially in forest areas. The concept of forest cities has received much attention in discussions around 
urbanization and sustainability. Forest cities offer innovative solutions to various environmental problems facing 
modern cities, such as air pollution, urban heat island effect, and loss of biodiversity (Ibrahim et al., 2023). Over the 
past few decades, extensive research has been conducted to explore the potential of urban forests in creating 
healthier and more sustainable urban environments. This concept is not just a temporary trend but is an integral part 
of modern urban planning strategies that integrate ecological principles with urban development (Gabrys, 2022). 
Rapid urbanization has negative impacts on the environment, such as air pollution, noise, urban heat islands, and 
1458","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Increasing research and development is another important improvement. Increased investment in research and 
development related to urban forests, including studies of ecological, social, and economic benefits, could enrich 
knowledge and best practices. Collaborating with universities and research institutions is essential to obtain new 
data and insights that can be used to improve urban forest design and implementation, adapt to changing 
conditions, and improve forest management strategies. 
 
Public education and awareness campaigns are also important. Launching an educational campaign to increase 
public awareness about the importance and benefits of urban forests can be done through social media, seminars 
and educational programs in schools. These campaigns increase public understanding and support for urban forest 
development and conservation efforts, building a culture of environmental stewardship and sustainable living. 
 
Finally, fostering multisectoral collaboration is the key to successful urban forest management. Building 
collaboration between government, private sector, NGO’s and local communities in urban forest planning and 
management ensures that all stakeholders are actively involved. This multisectoral approach increases the 
effectiveness and sustainability of urban forestry programs through synergy between various stakeholders, 
leveraging diverse expertise and resources to achieve better results. 
 
By implementing these proposed improvements, the development of forest cities can be optimized more effectively 
to achieve sustainability goals, improve the quality of life of residents, and preserve the environment. This strategic 
action will contribute to creating a greener, healthier and more resilient urban environment. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research highlights the importance of applying the forest city concept in addressing various environmental 
problems facing modern cities, including air pollution, urban heat island impact, and loss of biodiversity. Through 
the integration of vegetation into the urban environment, forest cities not only offer an effective ecological solution 
but also provide significant economic and social benefits. Urban forests can significantly reduce air pollution 
through the ability of trees and plants to absorb carbon dioxide and other pollutants while releasing oxygen. In 
addition, vegetation in urban forests can lower urban surface temperatures, reduce the heat island impact, and 
reduce energy requirements for cooling. Urban forests also provide natural habitats for various species of flora and 
fauna, increasing biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem balance. The presence of urban forests can increase 
property values, attract tourists, and create new economic opportunities in the tourism and environmental education 
sectors, as well as reduce public health costs through improving air quality. Additionally, urban forests offer green 
spaces that encourage physical activity, recreation, and social interaction, which collectively improve the quality of 
life for their residents. 
 
This research also identifies the importance of balancing the three main pillars of sustainability, namely 
environmental, economic, and social, which can be achieved through the application of the sustainability triangle 
theory in the development of forest cities. Analysis of existing urban forestry projects shows that the success of 
these initiatives relies heavily on the commitment and collaboration of various parties, including government, the 
private sector, local communities, and research institutions. The policy recommendations suggested in this research, 
such as increasing community participation, adopting green technology, diversifying plant species, and developing 
supporting policies, aim to strengthen and optimize the implementation of urban forests in the future. With a strong 
framework and active participation from various stakeholders, forest cities can be a real and sustainable solution for 
creating greener, healthier, and more prosperous cities. 
 
This research is expected to make a significant contribution to the academic literature and practice of sustainable 
urban development, providing evidence that the forest city concept is an effective and comprehensive approach to 
addressing urban environmental challenges. By continuing to develop and apply this concept, it is hoped that future 
cities will be more environmentally friendly, economically competitive, and prosperous for their residents.

Abstract 
The people dimension in the service industry is a critical asset, where companies have the pressure to retain talent and 
continuously deliver value to their customers. Sharing knowledge among employees is crucial to sustain quality 
services and incorporate the voice of the customer in their activities. As Lean Service (LS) is the application of Lean 
principles to service, this research aims to present how LS can develop and enhance a team learning process. Hence, 
using a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data, and through case study research, two 
years of investigation were performed. Based on the set up of different and innovative action learning activities, which 
enrolled a universe of 73 workers, it was possible to perform 27 innovative training sessions, which represented an 
amount of 114 training hours to 170 participants, where an average of 89% of success was obtained. Additionally, an 
organised and standard on-job training process was set up with 6 communities of practice (CP), and over one year, 80 
on-job training hours were delivered by subject matter experts. Each CP is working on a daily basis as a Lean cell, 
producing and sharing knowledge within the organisation, and addressing problem-solving. The study highlights the 
potential of Lean Service in developing and enhancing team learning and provides actionable insights for effective 
interventions in people’s dimension.

1. Introduction
As Lean can be applied to whichever organisation (Womack and Jones 2003), it is possible to move production 
principles to services (Levitt, 1972), and literature demonstrates the applicability of Lean to the service industry 
(Osborne et al. 2013; Radnor et al. 2013; dos Reis and Vieira, 2015; Ferreira et al. 2018). Hence, Lean Service is the 
application of Lean principles to services (Ahlstrom 2004). 
In Bowen and Youngdahl’s (1998) research, the first Lean study in service industries, the relevance of people in Lean 
adoption was pointed out, as well as the risks of a Lean implementation without considering this critical success factor. 
Consequently, the relationship between Lean and people is identified in the literature review (Ciano’s et al. 2019).      
As services are delivered by people-to-people (Gupta et al. 2016), the service industry is highly dependent on human 
resources, thus, this research focuses on the contextual as well as on the technological aspects of Lean Service in 
peoples’ domain, particularly in the learning domain. Hence, the purpose is to study how Lean, based on action 
learning activities, can develop and enhance a team learning process within a service organisation. 
Tan et al. (2023) presented different field-training interventions from the literature to demonstrate its positive effects 
on employees, particularly on divergent thinking and problem-solving behaviour. These authors cited several studies

Figure 1. Total of participants per session  
Regarding the average dropout rate over this period, from the participants who filled in the form and not attending the 
sessions, the rate was 3.5% and the attendance average of participants was 21 per session. As each session had an 
evaluation form, the average achieved in all sessions was 89%. From the trainers’ point of view, as they were all 
internal workers (managers and subject matter experts) it was possible to invite and involve a total of 16 trainers along 
the 27 sessions, which were supported by the project team.  
On average and per each training session, 3 documents were produced or reviewed representing more than 80 training 
materials produced/reviewed over these two years of investigation. This material will be reutilized for next training 
editions and future customer training.  
Additionally, and in each community of practice (CP) per knowledge subject, the subject matter experts (SME) are 
providing on-job-training to members based on a defined plan. On average, 80 planned hours of on-job-training were 
performed over one year, between SME and contact persons, plus the hours of unstructured communication spent 
daily through the Microsoft Teams chats when it was required to work in problem-solving. Furthermore, analysing 
the last figures of customer requests answered by each worker, it was possible to verify the increase of number of 
employees who are now replying and helping others in problem-solving.  
As a Lean journey can transform workers into thinkers, improving their technical competences as well as the soft 
skills, particularly team building, polyvalence, decision-making, assumptions of responsibility, self-learning and self-
adaptation (Alves, Dinis-Carvalho and Sousa 2012), during this team learning process with Lean Service, 5 team 
building sessions were held to invest in team working and networking.  
In the same way, as Emiliani (1998) raised the importance of empowering Lean behaviours such as self-awareness, 
humility, compassion, calmness, reflection, honesty, consistency, and generosity (Almeida-Sousa 2021), these 
behaviours were also addressed during the process. However, in doing so, during the on-job training both managers 
and co-workers realised the real and negative impacts of the pandemic situation and its consequences in the workers’ 
personal lives, thus, in their mental health. 
Additionally, the changes introduced by the hybrid work and the new ways of working, particularly more 
communication channels and new procedures, had also effects on the workers’ mental health. Therefore, to help its 
work force, in 2023 X set up a psychologist line plus psychologist appointments with a third-party company. 
Nowadays, this service is still encouraged by X to all its employees.   
6. Conclusion 
As the research question of this paper was to demonstrate how Lean Service can develop and enhance a team learning 
process, two years of investigation using a mixed method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data 
through service case study research, thoroughly proved its effectiveness.  
 
Two P-D-C-A Lean Service improvement cycles were performed and based on the insights gathered from the first 
cycle, an innovative and flexible training program was set up, focused on each employee and his personal context.

Hence, 27 training sessions were delivered by 16 internal trainers, in a total of 114 training hours. The total of 
participants in all these sessions was 170, with an average of 21 participants per session. Based on the quantitative 
data gathered, a high level of participation was proven, with an average of 89% obtained in the session’s evaluations, 
which demonstrates the success of these action learning activities. From the 73 enrolled employees, the average of 
participation was more than 2 sessions per worker with a dropout rate of 3.5%. The qualitative data obtained in each 
online session, supported by semi-structured interviews conducted at the end of the sessions, allowed to perceive that 
the employees wanted to learn and improve and were happy to be engaged in the learning process.  
 
The on-job-training strategy and the creation of communities of practices for the main knowledge subjects, was a bust 
to empower knowledge, and over one year, an investment of 80 on-job training hours were delivered by subject matter 
experts to workers. This action learning activity allowed to increase the number of experts within the organisation, 
particularly in problem-solving and answering critical customers’ requests.    
 
Hence, after two years of investigation, it was concluded that a Lean Service approach can develop and enhance team 
learning process in this service industry organisation. In the meanwhile, further action learning activities will be 
planned to achieve continuous improvement of this team learning process.
