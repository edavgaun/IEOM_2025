Abstract 
This study examines the dynamics of implementing Dojo training centers in the manufacturing industry and how 
management commitment influences these dynamics. Dojo training centers are recognized for their structured approach 
to enhancing employee skills, which can significantly improve operational efficiency.  Utilizing the system dynamics 
approach, the study employs a methodology that models how different components within a manufacturing training 
system interact and influence each other over time. The modeling and simulation process uses the software tool Vensim, 
which allows the construction, simulation, and analysis of system dynamics models of the training system.  The findings 
indicate that as management commitment to training increases, there is a corresponding increase in the conversion of new 
or unskilled workers to skilled workers, leading to an increase in profit and target revenue ratio. In particular, an 80% 
management commitment to training is identified as the optimal solution for achieving a steady increase in profit and 
target revenue ratio. The key conclusion drawn from this research is that management commitment directly and 
significantly impacts the overall performance of a manufacturing organization employing Dojo training centers. The study 
emphasizes the importance of using the system dynamics approach in training program evaluation and resource allocation 
decisions, which enhances operational efficiency and maximizes profitability in the manufacturing industry.

Introduction 
1.1 Introduction to Dojo Training Centers 
Dojo training centers play a crucial role in developing and enhancing technical skills in the manufacturing industry. These 
centers provide a structured and systematic approach to training, focusing on process development, skill improvement, 
and production planning. The effectiveness of Dojo training centers in equipping assembly line personnel with the 
necessary technical skills has been widely recognized and researched. Learning by simulation can be very effective 
because learners can test the effects of various decision parameters on natural and artificial processes in a controlled 
environment (Kotir et al. 2024). In recent years, there has been a growing interest in incorporating Industry 4.0 
technologies into the training and development of manufacturing industries. These technologies, such as virtual and 
augmented reality, can significantly enhance the learning experience for individuals in the manufacturing industry by 
providing realistic industry simulations and interactive training exercises.

Figure 10. Target Revenue Ratio Based on Different Management Commitment to Training 
 
Figure 10. illustrates an increase in the target revenue ratio compared to the organization's actual performance. 20% 
Commitment to training results in a 71.46% target revenue ratio at the end of the 60th month of simulation. 30% 
Commitment to training demonstrates a continuous increase in the target revenue ratio from 71% in the 1st month to 
93.53% in the 60th month. 40% Commitment to training demonstrates a continuous increase in target revenue ratio 
from 71% in the 1st month and reaches its peak in the 24th month with a 94.75% target revenue ratio. 50% 
Commitment to training demonstrates a continued increase in target revenue ratio from 71% in the 1st month and 
peaked in the 16th month with a 95.33% target revenue ratio. Lastly, 50% Commitment to training demonstrates a 
continuous increase in the target revenue ratio from 71% in the first month. It peaked in the fifth month with a 94.5% 
target revenue ratio. This result can determine how management reacts to different product types. Organizations with 
slow-moving and non-developing products may commit to training with a 30% commitment. In contrast, fast-moving 
and continuously evolving products should commit to 80% commitment to training to remain competitive in the 
market and maximize the full potential and revenue an organization can obtain. 
 
The holistic analysis of the impact of training on profit and performance, in conjunction with the management’s 
commitment to training, underscores the importance of leveraging Vensim and System Dynamics methodology in 
ensuring the success of Dojo Training in the manufacturing industry. By embracing this approach, the Dojo Training 
Center can proactively adapt its training programs to meet evolving sustainability goals, optimize profitability, and 
foster long-term operational success. The Dojo Training Center must continue harnessing the power of Vensim and 
System Dynamics methodology to refine its training strategies and integrate sustainable practices into its operational 
framework. This iterative approach will enhance the center's operational resilience and position it as a frontrunner in 
sustainable manufacturing practices.

Abstract 
This study utilized a hybrid scholarly network analysis by combining citation-based and text-based approaches to 
understand the conceptualization, measurement, and antecedents of operational resilience in the supply chain risk 
management literature. Specifically, we employed a Bibliographic Coupling Analysis in the research cluster 
formation stage and a Co-words Analysis in the research cluster interpretation and analysis stage. Our analysis 
reveals three major research clusters of resilience research in the SCRM literature, namely (1) supply chain 
network design and optimization, (2) organizational capabilities, and (3) digital technologies. We portray the 
research process in the last two decades in terms of the problems studied, commonly used approaches and theories, 
and solutions provided in each cluster. We then provide a conceptual framework on the conceptualization and 
antecedents of resilience based on studies in these clusters and highlight potential areas that need to be studied 
further. Finally, we leverage the concept of abnormal operating performance to propose a new measurement for 
resilience. This measurement overcomes the limitation of most current measurements that focus on the resistance 
or recovery stage - without capturing the growth stage.

Abstract 
This research paper unveils PERT 3.0, an innovative analytical framework designed to address the prevailing 
ambiguities associated with the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) in project risk simulation 
leveraging expert judgments. By conducting a comprehensive historical analysis, we trace the evolution of PERT from 
its inception as a second-moment analytical tool (PERT 1.0) to its development into a hybrid probability distribution 
within the beta distribution family (PERT 2.0), emphasizing three-point subjective uncertainty assessments. PERT 3.0 
emerges as a refined, ambiguity-free solution, clarifying misunderstandings surrounding PERT 2.0's perceived 
uniformity. This advancement not only sheds light on the misinterpretations but also significantly enhances the 
theoretical and practical applications of PERT in project risk management, offering a more precise and reliable tool 
for expert-driven risk assessment.

Abstract 
Managing projects to ensure optimal performance is a major challenge. As organizations prioritize efficiency and 
excellence in project execution, accurate performance measurement mechanisms become more important. This study 
uses statistical process control principles to explore how organizations can monitor and enhance project performance, 
using an anechoic chamber for Electro Magnetic Compatibility (EMC) as an example to illustrate these concepts. This 
specialized chamber serves as a critical environment for conducting electromagnetic compatibility testing, 
underscoring its pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and functionality of electronic equipment. Our investigation 
evaluates the project's performance, focusing particularly on cost and schedule management. Statistical Process 
Control (SPC) and Earned Value Management (EVM) methodologies are used to effectively monitor the project 
schedule's progress in this study. By leveraging EVM, we derive key performance metrics, including the Schedule 
Performance Index (SPI) and the Cost Performance Index (CPI). Subsequently, SPC analysis is employed to scrutinize 
SPI and CPI outputs, discerning whether these indices fall above or below the Center Line (CL), thus providing 
insights into project performance trends. Our findings provide a picture of project performance. SPI study shows three 
months of performance above the CL, six months around the CL, and three months below the CL. Similarly, CPI 
analysis shows three months above the CL, four months near the CL, and five months below the CL. Incorporating 
EVM and SPC techniques provides the project team with actionable insights, allowing proactive decision-making and 
efficient problem-solving. This comprehensive strategy enables stakeholders to optimize project results, resulting in 
greater success.

Figure 3. Control chart for CPI 
 
As for the CPI, the results show that during the first two months of the project, the CPI indicator was above the center 
line but still under the upper control limit, where the EV > AC, resulting in the progress being effective and budget-
wise. Also, in months 4 and 9, the CPI indicator was above the center line but still under the upper control limit. In 
months 5, 6, 7, and 11, the CPI value is nearly in Center Line (CL), indicating that a project progress is most likely on 
budget. However, in months 3, 8, 10, and 12, the CPI value of the project is under the Center Line, and less than 1 
where the EV < AC,  indicates that the project progress is over budget. 
5. Conclusion 
The application of Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques, particularly through the utilization of Schedule 
Performance Index (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI) analysis from the Earned Value Management (EVM) 
approach, has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of our project's schedule progress and budgetary 
performance. Using Statistical Process Control methods, we constructed a control chart with computed center lines 
and control limits derived from 12 observations of the SPI indicator. This rigorous approach enabled the team to 
promptly detect deviations from the project timeline and facilitated targeted interventions to address underlying issues 
or capitalize on emerging opportunities. 
 
Moreover, utilizing the SPI provided valuable insights into the project's performance dynamics. The initial months 
witnessed a slower pace of progress, prompting a detailed examination of individual activities to identify bottlenecks 
and inefficiencies. Subsequent interventions based on these findings resulted in gradual improvements, reflected in 
the SPI rising above the center line in certain intervals. However, the notable surge in progress during months 10 and 
11 underscored the project's resilience and adaptability. This rapid advancement demonstrated the team's capacity to 
overcome challenges and hinted at the project's potential for overall success. 
 
Similarly, the analysis of the CPI shed light on the project's budgetary performance over time. While periods of cost 
efficiency were observed during the project's inception and at intermittent stages, indicating effective resource 
utilization, challenges with budget management surfaced during other phases. During certain months, the CPI values 
falling below the center line and below 1 signaled over-budget progress, necessitating corrective measures to realign 
expenditures with planned targets. In essence, the combined insights from SPI and CPI analysis facilitated proactive 
decision-making and empowered the project team to navigate challenges effectively and capitalize on opportunities, 
ultimately enhancing the project's chances of success. 
 
Incorporating SPC principles into the project management approach enabled the team to make informed decisions and 
take proactive steps to ensure project success. Moving forward, the insights gleaned from this analysis will serve as a 
foundation for continuous improvement, guiding the efforts to enhance project efficiency and effectiveness in future 
endeavors. By applying SPC principles, the project team remains committed to achieving its project objectives and 
delivering value to stakeholders. 
 
Future research could investigate the integration of advanced predictive analytics with SPC and EVM techniques to 
improve early identification of potential project deviations. The use of machine learning algorithms could enable real-
time data analysis and predictive modeling, allowing for more accurate and timely interventions. Moreover, extending 
the study to encompass a wider variety of projects across different industries could help confirm the effectiveness of

these methodologies in various settings. Additional research could also examine the influence of team dynamics and 
external factors on SPI and CPI fluctuations, providing a more comprehensive view of project performance. Finally, 
refining control limits and center lines using larger datasets and longer project timelines could enhance the precision 
of SPC charts, leading to even more effective project management practices.

Abstract 
We present a two-stage redistricting-location problem in the context of emergency evacuation planning. The first stage 
is a multi-objective fair redistricting problem re-evaluating the pre-existing district assignments to optimize the 
prioritization of equitable population distribution and hazard risks mitigation while ensuring spatial adjacency and 
compactness. The optimal re-districting solution enters the second stage as a parameter for the facility location-
allocation problem, which yields the optimal location of short- and long-term evacuation centers and allocation of 
districts to chosen facilities. A real-world case from Cagayan de Oro City in the Philippines is considered. Numerical 
results demonstrate that the solution approach significantly improved the emergency response of the local government 
during Super Typhoon Rai, the second most destructive typhoon in the Philippines.

Abstract 
In this study, an approach is proposed to address a variant of the Pollution Traveling Salesman Problem (PTSP), which 
focuses on fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Since PTSP generalizes the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), 
it is classified as NP-Hard. This problem involves visiting all customers by a vehicle, minimizing an objective function 
that considers various factors such as speed, truck load, and distance traveled. Computational experiments were 
conducted to evaluate the performance of several integer linear programming solvers. Additionally, a metaheuristic 
was developed that combines mathematical models and metaheuristic techniques to find near-optimal solutions in 
reduced times. The implementation was carried out in Julia 1.7, using the JuMP 1.0 library for both the metaheuristic 
and mathematical models. In the first phase of the metaheuristic, the PTSP model with the minimum distance objective 
function was executed to quickly find a solution, followed by the application of various metaheuristics to improve it. 
In the second phase, previous solutions were used in the PTSP model, which yielded promising results in terms of 
solution quality and computation time. Among the evaluated solvers, it is highlighted that Gurobi outperformed others 
in terms of execution time and solution quality.

organizations and users have become accustomed to the interfaces. Microsoft Teams and Zoom have a global presence 
and are commonly known by organizations worldwide. However, web-based remote desktop tools such as Glance 
software can leverage modern security protocols and encryption standards to ensure secure remote connections. It is 
crucial for IT companies dealing with sensitive data and compliance requirements; thus, switching and upgrading to 
this new technology is critical. System Usability Scale (SUS), which provides a standardized measure of perceived 
Usability, will be used primarily in this study to provide valuable insights into the user's perception of system usability, 
allowing organizations to make informed decisions for enhancing user experience. Integrating Usability measurement 
and Process Sigma helps ensure process improvements enhance efficiency and align with user needs and expectations. 
Results from Standardized Usability Metrics of Glance show that the quality level for Task Completion is 96%, Error 
Rates of 4%, Task Times of 1.7795 in minutes, and User Satisfaction is 92% with an overall sigma level (z-score) of 
3.3276, this is 0.9280 higher than the combined usability average of Microsoft Teams and Zoom applications. By 
integrating usability considerations, organizations can strike a balance between operational efficiency (as emphasized 
by Six Sigma) and user satisfaction, leading to a more holistic approach to process improvement, which in this case 
is switching and upgrading an IT company to a Web-based Screen Share Remote Access Tool from traditional desktop 
support applications.

1. Introduction
As technology evolves, so do the needs of IT companies. Web-based tools may leverage the latest advancements, such 
as improved performance, enhanced user interfaces, and better user experiences, contributing to the decision to switch 
from traditional apps. IT companies are increasingly upgrading and switching to web-based remote desktop tools over 
conventional communication and collaboration platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams for their external clients 
for several reasons. These traditional apps usually require participants to install software on their devices. Web-based 
tools eliminate this requirement, reducing user friction and making initiating remote sessions or collaborations easier. 
Web-based remote desktop tools can provide the necessary features for IT support teams to connect to users' machines 
and resolve issues efficiently. A case study of a software company that typically uses Microsoft Teams and Zoom for 
remote sessions with their clients implements a significant shift of switching to Glance Software as part of process 
improvement and providing a more efficient, effective, and secured client support experience will be the basis for this 
study.

6. Conclusion 
Usability improvements in the Glance system stemmed from a more intuitive user interface, simplified navigation, 
and thoughtful design choices. Users found adapting to the Glance system easier, increasing satisfaction and 
productivity. Compared to the traditional Remote Desktop tools, Glance's user-centric design contributed to a positive 
user experience, minimizing the learning curve and allowing users to focus on their tasks rather than grappling with 
the complexities of the interface. Moreover, analyzing box plot data for completion, error, and satisfaction rates 
provides a comprehensive understanding of the new system's performance. Higher completion rates, user satisfaction, 
and lower error rates suggest that the new system delivers positive outcomes. It's essential to continue monitoring 
these metrics over time to ensure the sustained success of the implemented changes. 
 
These findings have practical implications for organizations seeking effective remote collaboration tools. The Glance 
system not only outperforms competitors in terms of Usability but also has the potential to enhance overall productivity 
and user satisfaction in remote work scenarios. As businesses continue to adapt to remote work environments, the 
usability advantages offered by the Glance system position it as an asset in facilitating seamless and user-friendly 
collaboration. Considering these results, it is recommended that organizations consider the Glance system as a 
preferred choice for remote desktop screen sharing, taking advantage of its superior usability features to enhance 
communication and collaboration among team members. The insights gained from this case study underscore the 
importance of prioritizing Usability in selecting collaboration tools, ultimately contributing to the overall success of 
remote work initiatives.

Abstract 
Due to the inherent trustworthiness of blockchain features, its implementation is expected to substantially enhance 
trust in supply chain relationships. While the topic of blockchain and trust has recently garnered attention from supply 
chain scholars, consensus in the current literature is lacking, and empirical studies remain limited. This study aims to 
address these gaps by exploring the impact of blockchain on inter-organizational trust through case studies of 
blockchain usage. Through 22 interviews with blockchain practitioners in the food and banking industries, the findings 
reveal four scenarios illustrating how blockchain implementation can differently impact inter-organizational trust in 
supply chains. First, blockchain can facilitate trustless transactions, similar to cryptocurrency trading, where trust in 
blockchain replaces the need for trust between supply chain partners. This scenario is likely to happen in transactional 
relationships or spot trading. Second, in scenarios where blockchain use is mandatory, its implementation can 
strengthen inter-organizational trust in established partnership relationships. Third, in scenarios where blockchain use 
is voluntary, the technology can be used as a signaling tool in early-stage relationships. Suppliers, for instance, can 
utilize blockchain to communicate trustworthiness signals to potential and new buyers, thereby initiating and 
developing their inter-organization trust. Fourth, in certain scenarios where blockchain is implemented among 
unfamiliar supply chain parties with limited trust, blockchain can establish swift trust in itself, which can subsequently 
be transferred to increased inter-organizational trust between these parties. The study contributes to blockchain 
literature by providing comprehensive views of different scenarios in which blockchain can impact trust in supply 
chains.

Abstract 
This paper aims to analyze how information technology are related to organizational performance, firm innovation, 
and customer relationship management. It also examines how firm innovation, customer relationship management, 
and environmental compliance influence on organizational performance. In addition, this study adopts a quantitative 
approach, with questionnaires distributed to 110 respondents collected from both large enterprises and small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam applying convenience sampling approaches. The structural analysis will 
be carried out utilizing PLS-SEM modeling. The result shows that information technology has a positive effect on 
organizational performance as well as firm innovation and customer relationship management. Additionally, firm 
innovation and environmental compliance enhance organizational performance. While previous studies have delved 
into the impact of information technology on organizational performance, as well as the impact of firm innovation and 
customer relationship management on performance, this study makes an original contribution by examining these 
relationships concurrently in a Vietnamese context. It, furthermore, offers valuable insights for Vietnamese businesses 
striving to improve their performance through the use of information technology, innovation, customer management, 
and environmental practices.

Abstract 
In the current flow of sustainable development, corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and their related 
supporting factors become vital foundations for running a business successfully. This paper's objective is to identify 
the relationships among environmental regulations (ER), CSR practices, and ethical culture (EC) affecting business 
performance (BP) under the stakeholder theory. The implemented questionnaire follows a quantitative approach with 
107 valid responses collected from various industries and company sizes in Viet Nam using the method of convenience 
sampling. The PLS-SEM modeling was used to test the hypothesis of the research model. The analysis suggested that 
CSR practices and EC have significantly positive relationships with BP. Whereas, ER indirectly affects firm 
performance through promoting CSR practices of the organizations. In addition, the ethical factor is revealed to have 
a positive significance in the relationship with CSR practices. The results of this contribute detailed insights to the firm 
strategists on how to drive business effectively in terms of sustainable development management and CSR engagement 
through the combination of incorporating ethical culture management and corporate social responsibility practices. 
Additionally, it brings further implications for consideration of business prosperity aligning with CSR pursuing and 
the environmental regulations enacted by the government due to society's needs.

Abstract 
Supply chain management (SCM) has emerged as a strategic tool to gain competitive advantage through cooperative, 
collaborative and partnership arrangements between the firms. The large number of interdependent activities in the 
supply chain needs effective management of its performance. We argue that an effective performance measurement 
system (PMS) can help to manage, control and improve supply chain management practices (SCMP). Limited 
literature is available to explore the innovative way to develop effective PMS and its impact on organizational 
performance. The data were collected from manufacturing firms in Australia. The theoretical research framework was 
tested using the partial least square (PLS) method by using 'SmartPLS'. Structural equation modelling was used to 
develop a structural model to reliably measure the relationships between the constructs of supply chain management 
practices (SCMP), supply chain performance measurement system (SCPMS), and organization performance (OP). 
The findings suggest that supply chain management practices positively influence the development of the performance 
measurement system of the firm. It also confirms that supply chain management practices significantly affect 
organization performance directly. Regarding the mediating effect of the performance measurement system on firm 
performance, this study identified that the performance measurement system has a significant positive influence on 
financial performance but a negative on market performance. This study provides useful information and guidance to 
practitioners for designing an innovative process-based supply chain management framework. The innovative process-
based supply chain management practices provide the structure that can help develop an effective performance 
measurement system to gain competitive advantage and, ultimately, organizational performance.

Abstract 
Shared taxis are ubiquitous throughout Southeast Asia. Unlike buses, this mode of transportation does not have fixed 
routes or schedules. Its distinctive feature is the transport of multiple passengers with different origins and destinations 
in one trip. Thus, shared taxis can be regarded as a public transportation service that is an intermediate between taxis 
and shared buses. More specifically, passengers inform the driver of their destinations, as in regular taxi services, with 
the driver picking up other passengers heading in the same direction along the way. If there are drop-off points for 
other passengers before they reach their destination, the driver makes a slight detour to drop them off first. Thus, travel 
distance can increase depending on the number of additional passengers along the path. Although the taxi visits the 
drop-off points of passengers in order of proximity, the drop-off points of any new passengers picked up during a trip 
are continuously added to the route. Consequently, passengers might not necessarily travel the shortest route to their 
destinations. In this study, we modeled a formula to determine the average travel distance of a shared taxi using 
Crofton's differential equations. We assumed that passengers appear randomly within a circular urban area and travel 
along a straight line between their origin and destination points. In our validation experiment, the average distance 
estimated by the model was compared with that obtained via computer simulation.

Abstract 
This study aims to construct a method of using ICT to evaluate students' “Positive Attitude Towards Learning”. In the experiment, 
we investigated the relationship between student collaboration and student personality in a collaborative learning situation in 
order to determine whether personality could be related to how they performed in an assessment of their “Positive Attitude 
Towards Learning”. In this paper, two hypotheses were formulated and tested. The results showed that (H1) there was no 
correlation between student personality and the number of students involved in exchange learning. (H2) In some cases, there was 
a connection between students with moderate levels of extraversion and openness, otherwise, no relationship was found.

1. Introduction
Transition of Learning Assessment in Japan
Learning assessment within Japanese schools is based on the School Education Law
established in 1947, which, in Article 30, section 2, introduces and broadly defines the concept of “Positive Attitude Towards
Learning”. Japan has adopted an assessment system in accordance to this law, which focuses on three dimensions:
Knowledge and Skills
Thinking, Judgement and Expression
Positive Attitude Towards Learning
These perspectives are used for each subject to evaluate students' learning. In the 
past, the evaluation method of “Positive Attitude Towards Learning” was not elaborated. For example, it was noted that teachers 
recorded situations in which personality and behavioral tendencies were temporarily expressed, such as the number of times an 
individual raised their hand or whether they were taking notes (Central Council for Education 2019). Starting from the three 
dimensions aforementioned, this paper suggests that two other aspects should be considered for a more accurate evaluation, 
namely: 
Aspects of persistent efforts toward acquiring knowledge and skills, and acquiring the ability to think, judge, and express. 
Aspects of attempting to self-regulated learning through persistent efforts 
Self-regulated learning (SRL) is “the self-directive process through which learners transform

5. Discussion  
In this chapter, we summarize our discussion using the two hypotheses established in Chapter 2. 
 
5.1 The relationship between students' personalities and their positivity in exchange learning 
In this section, we summarize our discussion of hypothesis H1. 4.3 and Figure 4 show that there was no correlation 
between student personality and the number of students involved in the exchange learning. Furthermore, it was also 
the case for only those students who conveyed and collected information. Based on these results, hypothesis H1 can 
be adopted only for the present case, but there is a need to increase the number of cases. 
 
According to these results, there is no relationship between personality and the number of students involved in 
exchange learning. We are of the opinion that the evaluation of “Positive Attitude Towards Learning” should not 
dependent on the personality of the students. Extroverted students may score higher on this assessment because they 
are more likely to actively engage with others in the classroom. On the other hand, an introverted student may receive 
the opposite rating. There are a number of studies that have investigated the transformation of this personality as a 
function of age, with some cases reporting a gradual change in personality from childhood to adulthood (Roberts et 
al. 2006). Therefore, we consider this personality to be an invariant value in the short term. In the present case study, 
the number of students involved in collaborative learning did not differ depending on the level of extraversion. 
Therefore, we believe that the number of students involved in exchange learning can be used as a variable to utilize 
in this evaluation. Since the students in this case study were in a state of mutual understanding, the results may be 
different when students are meeting each other for the first time or in a similar state. 
 
5.2 Relevance by student personality through exchange learning 
In this section, we summarize our discussion of hypothesis H2. The results in Figure 3 indicate that in the present case 
study, while there were cases of strong connections between students with moderate levels of extraversion and 
openness, no other relationships were observed. Therefore, it is clear that the relationships between students that occur 
during exchange learning do not tend to be linked by similarities in personality. Confirming previous studies, similarity 
of personality between friends does not determine the level of satisfaction between students, as there is a case that 
similarity of personality does not relate to the level of satisfaction with friendship (Körner 2023). How, then, do 
students decide with whom to interact? Considering internal factors, they may choose to associate with members of 
the same gender, club, or region as themselves. Considering external factors, temporary and arbitrarily formed groups 
influenced by the layout of the classroom and the student proximity may also influence group affiliation. In this type 
of situation where students interact freely, their interactions are governed by a variety of factors as opposed to the 
situation in which they have to interact within pre-assigned groups. 
 
This concept is similar to the free address concept that has been adopted by companies. One of the objectives of free 
address is to improve the facilitation of communication. Simon (1997) states that the layout of offices is one of the 
important formal determinants of the communication system. In exchange classes, it is necessary to create a classroom 
environment in which students can interact freely to facilitate communication and increase motivation to achieve class 
goals. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study investigated the relationship between student association during collaborative learning and the personality 
of students who participated in the class. It also examined whether student personality may be related to the assessment 
of students' attitudes toward independent learning. In this paper, two hypotheses were formulated, and experiments 
were conducted to test the hypotheses. The results showed that (H1) there was no correlation between individual 
personality and the number of students involved in collaborative learning. Furthermore, it revealed that there was no 
correlation between the number of students who were involved in collaborative learning, the number of students who 
only engaged by relaying information, and the number of students who were not engaged at all. It was similar when 
we specified students who provided or collected the information. (H2) In some cases, there were strong connections 
between students with moderate levels of extraversion and openness, but otherwise no relationship was found. 
Therefore, when evaluating “Positive Attitude Towards Learning,” it is possible to use the number of students involved 
in exchange learning as a measure of evaluating performance. However, factors such as internal and external 
motivators for affiliation, as well as student personality should also be considered in any evaluations going forward.

Abstract 
This research aims to reduce the time required to change and install plastic injection molds for automotive parts and 
to increase the number of injected automotive parts produced at an automotive parts manufacturing plant. The current 
situation shows that the machine to be improved undergoes mold changes an average of 21 times per month, with a 
mold change and installation time of 66 minutes per instance. The researcher studied the mold change and installation 
procedures using work-study principles and direct time study methods and analyzed ways to improve by applying the 
Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) technique in conjunction with the ECRS (Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, 
Simplify) and 5W1H (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How) principles. It was found that there was a mix of internal 
and external setup tasks. By separating internal and external tasks, it was discovered that 39.65% of the tasks were 
external, which could be performed while the machine was running. Utilizing ECRS principles, a separate color hot-
runner system was installed to facilitate easier installation, and quick-connect couplings were added to reduce the time 
needed for hydraulic setup. After applying ECRS and 5W1H principles, the time for changing and installing plastic 
injection molds for automotive parts was reduced by 31%, and the number of injected automotive parts increased by 
10%.

Introduction 
Thailand is a significant global production base for the automotive industry. In 2022, Thailand produced 1,883,515 
vehicles of all types, ranking 11th globally, 5th in Asia (behind China, Japan, India, and South Korea), and 1st in 
ASEAN. The production increased by 12% compared to the previous year, reflecting a gradual recovery from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Positive factors include China's reopening, which has led to a recovery in global trade and 
tourism, benefiting Thailand. Issues such as the semiconductor shortage and shipping container scarcity are also 
easing. This has led to positive signals in economic activity and consumer demand/purchasing power domestically 
and in Thailand's key export markets. However, challenges such as oil prices, inflation, the appreciation of the Thai 
baht, and tensions from the Russia-Ukraine war remain significant factors impacting the growth of the global and Thai 
automotive industry [Abdulmalek & Rajgopal 2007]. The case study factory is classified as a Tier 1 plastic parts 
manufacturer, directly supplying automotive manufacturers/assemblers. This group includes approximately 529 
companies, accounting for 23% of all automotive parts manufacturers [Cakmakci et al. 2009 ]. 
In Thailand's highly competitive automotive industry, manufacturers must improve production efficiency to reduce 
waste and costs in the production process, thereby enhancing their competitiveness. The company in the case study is 
an automotive parts manufacturer that produces plastic engine compartment parts. The production line under study is 
a primary product line for the company, which aims to increase production capacity due to machinery limitations and

Figure 4.  Before and After Improvement Showing the Change to Female and Male Couplings for Ease of Use 
 
After the process of changing and installing plastic injection molds was improved, the researcher timed the process to 
compare the results of the improvements. 
 
4.4 Percentage Improvement in Time for Mold and Die Switching 
The percentage change was calculated to indicate the difference in time before and after the improvement using the 
formula: 
 
              ((Time before improvement – Time after improvement) ÷ Time before improvement)×100)) 
 
After the process improvement, it was observed that employee efficiency increased, leading to an increase in 
production capacity. The percentage improvement is as follows: 
 
Percentage Time Reduction= ((3869−2650) ÷  3869)×100 = 31.50 
 
The time reduction from the previous process was calculated to be 31.50 %. 
 
After implementing the SMED, ECRS, and 5W1H techniques, the mold changeover time was reduced by 31.50 %, 
from 64.48 minutes to approximately 44.17 minutes. This reduction in setup time resulted in a 10% increase in the 
production of injected automotive parts. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Implementing the SMED, ECRS, and 5W1H techniques significantly reduced the time required for mold 
changeovers, decreasing from approximately 64.48 minutes to 44.17 minutes, a reduction of approximately 31%. This 
efficiency improvement not only streamlined the production process but also increased the production of automotive 
parts by 10%. 
 
This research made several key improvements to enhance the mold change and installation process. The study began 
with a detailed analysis of the existing procedures, identifying inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement. The 
primary improvements included:

© IEOM Society International 
Separation of Internal and External Tasks: The process was made more efficient by distinguishing tasks that 
could be performed while the machine was running (external) from those that required the machine to be stopped 
(internal). This separation allowed for better time utilization, reducing downtime during mold changes. 
 
Application of ECRS Principles: 
Eliminate: Unnecessary steps were identified and removed. For instance, preparing equipment in advance minimized 
the need for waiting times during tool changes. 
 
Combine: Tasks were combined where possible to streamline operations. For example, setting up cooling and 
hydraulic lines concurrently rather than sequentially. 
 
Rearrange: The workflow was reorganized, assigning specific roles to each technician, ensuring a more coordinated 
and efficient process. This reorganization was supported by detailed training for the staff involved. 
Simplify: Poka-Yoke mechanisms were introduced to prevent errors and simplify the connection of various lines and 
components. Color-coding and labeled couplings made it easier for operators to correctly and quickly connect 
equipment. 
 
Training and Standardization: Comprehensive training sessions were conducted to ensure that all staff 
understood the new procedures and the importance of adhering to them. Standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) were documented and distributed, providing a clear and consistent guide for all personnel. 
 
Enhanced Equipment Readiness: By improving the readiness and availability of necessary tools and 
equipment, the waiting times for equipment were significantly reduced. This included ensuring that all 
necessary tools were in place before the start of the mold change process. 
 
The results of these improvements were substantial. The overall time for mold changes was reduced by 
31%, improving production efficiency and stabilizing the production output, making it more consistent and 
predictable. This stabilization and efficiency boost allowed the company to meet increasing customer 
demands and improve overall competitiveness in the market. 
 
The study demonstrates that significant gains in operational efficiency can be achieved through careful 
analysis and systematic improvements. The methodologies applied in this research provide a valuable 
framework for other manufacturing processes seeking similar improvements in efficiency and productivity.

Abstract 
Global consumption of beef has been growing for decades continuously. However, the production of beef declines 
due to global warming problem. The mismatch between supply and demand means that global trade in cattle and beef 
need to boost to satisfy increasing demands worldwide. Especially, China has been facing the supply-demand state of 
imbalance. Even though China is one of the most potential beef producers, China consistently imports more live cattle 
from Australia and imports remain strong in subsequent years. In addition, Ministry of Commerce recognizes a great 
opportunity to export Thai live cattle crosses boarders into China via overland routes through Laos. Furthermore, Thai 
Agriculture groups have strong potential to develop the quality of cattle to match the international standards and trade. 
The aim of this study is to propose the guidelines for enhancing Supply Chain of cattle based on Thai cross-border 
trade. The systems and non-value-added activities are evaluated by lean approach for system efficiency, production 
cost, and responsiveness in stakeholders’ demands under market conditions. According to data collection, Thai cattle 
are imported via the overland routes significantly affecting the standards of cattle trade: weight and disease-free. The 
study reveals that the core problems are Supply Chain activities and Logistic cost. Therefore, the study suggests that 
1) Animal Quarantine Base in Laos could decrease the possibility of mismatched standard cattle and control
production cost and 2) Route Planning could increase energy-efficient transportation. Ultimately, the results of this
study emphasize the importance of better-informed supply decisions for the future trade.

Abstract 
Sustainable last-mile deliveries are pivotal in addressing environmental challenges. This research paper analyses and 
compares the cost and environmental impact of ICE on EVs in Singapore’s context. In this research, the lifecycle costs 
of EVs and ICE vehicles that have a significant environmental impact were considered. An assessment from a Well-
to-Wheel perspective using data collected from a leading logistics service provider was applied to analyze energy  
consumption and carbon emissions. Furthermore, a survey was conducted to comprehend the awareness of EVs and 
the adoption feasibility among logistics personnel and individuals across various industries while the world transitions 
to more sustainable logistics planning and manufacturing. It gives an overview of public acceptance in moving towards 
lesser carbon emission delivery options for last-mile deliveries. The key findings revealed that firstly the availability 
of adequate charging infrastructures is essential in the EV adoption discussion; however, this can be overcome by the 
current URA-LTA tender, which is set to accomplish at least 60,000 charging points by 2030 (URA, 2020). Secondly, 
switching from combustion vehicles to electric vehicles was cost-efficient with the least environmental impact. The 
LCC results further validate that financial incentives and exemptions positively impact the adoption of EVs.

1. Introduction
Demand for last-mile deliveries increases considerable carbon emissions. (Kromer et al. 2022). They frequently 
involve vehicles that run on non-renewable fuels, causing air pollution and CO2 emissions that are detrimental to 
people and ecosystems. Emissions and fuel consumption is soaring due to delays, and traffic congestion. Fossil fuel 
consumption and deforestation are driving this trend to speed up climate change and increase greenhouse gas levels.   
Speed is prioritized in last-mile delivery procedures now, which raises carbon emissions. (Villena & Gioia  2020). As 
a result, implementing sustainable supply chain practices is essential, with an emphasis on achieving Environmental, 
Social, and Governance (ESG) goals. Implementing reductions in mileage and delivery vehicle deployments are 
possible remedies. Solutions to encounter the impacts and challenges of last-mile deliveries should include the 
adoption of electrical vehicles, including carbon emission tracking tools to measure carbon footprint emissions.

obtained from each specific commercial vehicle brand from the Company S database, whereby the emission factors were 
documented in megajoules per kilometer.  
 
The results showed that the well-to-wheel process for an Opel Vivaro (electric) had a lower energy consumption in 
comparison to Opel Vivaro (diesel) and Toyota Hi Ace (Petrol), which had 1.94MJ/KM and 2.23MJ/KM respectively.  
The tailpipe and GHG emissions were obtained from Company S emission calculators. Emissions from vehicle and 
battery productions were considered. The results allowed us to note that an electric LGV had lower greenhouse gas 
emissions than its petrol and diesel counterparts.  
 
5.2 Graphical Results  
The survey conducted had 83 respondents. Based on the survey data collected, the predominant group of respondents 
were from supply chain industries who had a profound understanding of the industry perspectives. There are other 
sectors, which can contribute to public awareness of carbon emissions and EVs. 77.11% of respondents expressed that 
savings from using electricity instead of petrol or diesel was the encouraging factor for them to purchase an electric 
vehicle. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Electric Vehicles Advantages 
Research Objective 3 
The study conducted a survey to measure consumer beliefs on EV adoption for last-mile deliveries. Survey results 
revealed a lack of awareness regarding government incentives and charging infrastructures. The LTA-URA tender 
aims for 60,000 EV charging points by 2030 (URA 2020). The Busways-Shell Consortium initiated fast EV charging 
since June 28, 2023, addressing infrastructure challenges for commercial fleet owners (Staff Reporter 2023). 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The first logical step for Company S is to obtain a telematic technology to tap into its current fleet to check on the 
route mileage and idle time each day. Investments in training and resources within the organization and among its 
stakeholders to be familiar with the advancements in technologies associated with the transitions to EVs.  
 
Finally, Company S could invest in an online tool similar to the EV Fleet Savings calculator that many fleet owners 
in America have utilised. The online tool enables an organisation to evaluate the costs associated with transitioning 
the current fleet of commercial vehicles to electric vehicles.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The paper has reviewed the adoption of electrified light-duty commercial trucks by analyzing a life cycle cost 
breakdown and a survey. The life cycle cost breakdown indicated the financial and usage effects, while the survey 
gave us insight into the public’s readiness for electric vehicles. The comprehensive direction of this paper is to examine 
EV adoption for last-mile deliveries in the supply chain process.

There were three objectives to be analyzed with specific methodologies. Firstly, a life cycle analysis was carried out 
to achieve the first objective to obtain the expected costs and externalities that may arise from the adoption of electric 
vehicles in Singapore. The findings proved that transitioning to electric commercial vehicles lead to cost reductions 
ranging from S$15,000.00 to S$60,000.00 over ten years. Secondly, an emission calculator and Well to Wheel (WTW) 
approach aided the author in analyzing if the adoption of electric commercial vehicles will promote sustainable last-
mile objectives. The results from tailpipe, GHG emissions and analysis from a (WTW) approach allowed the author 
to note that an electric LGV had lower greenhouse gas emissions than its petrol and diesel counterparts.   
Lastly, qualitative and quantitative methodologies were applied to obtain the objective of finding out how the adoption 
of electric vehicles will either affect or be beneficial to Company S. The findings were crucial in understanding 
consumers’ feelings and behavior if an organization shifted towards EV usage to complete last-mile deliveries.

Abstract 
This research aims to apply Lean techniques to reduce waste in the production process of a pottery company to below 
10%, enabling the company to meet increasing customer demands and shorten production times. Through a case study, 
Lean tools were utilized to improve process planning and control, employing the Deming Cycle for continuous 
enhancement. The research was conducted in five phases, beginning with data collection that revealed a 23% waste 
rate in the firing process over four months. Subsequent analysis identified key issues using Pareto diagrams and 
Fishbone Diagrams. Implementing targeted improvements, including temperature control in the firing process, 
reduced waste by 10-15%, ultimately lowering the overall waste rate to below 10%. This demonstrates the 
effectiveness of Lean techniques in optimizing production efficiency and reducing waste in the pottery industry.

1. Introduction
The pottery industry, characterized by its traditional production methods, often faces significant challenges related to 
waste in the manufacturing process. A lack of structured production planning and quality control measures frequently 
leads to inefficiencies, resulting in various issues such as increased costs, compromised product quality, and extended 
production times. Addressing these challenges is critical for maintaining competitiveness in the market, both 
domestically and internationally (Shah & Patel 2020; Kabir et al. 2020). Many industrial sectors have adopted lean 
techniques to improve efficiency and reduce waste. These methodologies help streamline production by identifying 
and addressing the root causes of waste, enabling the production of high-quality products with minimal costs and 
shorter production times. Lean tools, such as the 7 Wastes, 7 QC Tools, 5S, the Deming Cycle (PDCA), and Why-
Why Analysis, are particularly effective in enhancing production processes and meeting customer demands (Rao et 
al. 2019; Swarna & Mia 2020). 
The case study company in this research is involved in pottery, specifically producing plant pots for domestic and 
international markets. The company's production process is divided between gas-fired and wood-fired kilns. 
Preliminary analysis revealed that significant waste is generated when using wood-fired kilns, primarily due to the 
challenges in controlling firing temperatures. This study aims to reduce waste in the production process by employing 
Lean techniques to analyze the causes of inefficiencies, develop solutions, and establish production standards. By 
implementing these techniques, the company seeks to improve production efficiency and better meet the growing 
demands of its customers (Ziarati 2019).

5. Conclusion
This study investigated waste problems in a pottery factory, focusing on applying Lean techniques to analyze the root 
causes of inefficiencies and develop targeted solutions. The analysis revealed that most waste issues were concentrated 
in incineration, where defects such as cracks and over-firing were prevalent. The root cause of these defects was 
identified as the lack of a standardized temperature reference for firing. To address this, a thermocouple was 
implemented to collect data and establish temperature standards for the firing process. Implementing these standards 
resulted in a significant waste reduction, lowering the defect rate in the production process to below 10%, with a final 
waste rate of 4.87%. This improvement reduced production costs and enhanced the company's ability to effectively 
meet customer demands. 
While the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of Lean techniques in reducing waste in the pottery 
industry, there are opportunities for further research. Future studies could explore the long-term sustainability of these

Abstract 
The chicken farm operations in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, Thailand, prioritize stringent hygiene standards across 
production, transportation, and employee protocols. One critical regulation prohibits employees from bringing or 
consuming external food within farm premises to prevent contamination risks. Consequently, centralized meal 
preparation with strict cleanliness control is mandated, and meals are delivered to various farm units within the supply 
chain. Daily food transportation involves delivering three meals to 12 farms, necessitating 36 trips per day. Drivers 
work 8 hours daily, with a 1-hour break and a 1-hour vehicle maintenance post-delivery, and they are legally entitled 
to one day off per week. This results in driver shortages and the absence of decision-support tools for optimal route 
planning, leading to delivery delays and overtime work. This study aims to develop a mathematical model to optimize 
driver allocation and route planning, ensuring minimal total travel distance using principles from the Traveling 
Salesman Problem (TSP). The results demonstrate a reduction in each driver's trips from 4 to 3 per day, achieving the 
minimum total travel distance. Additionally, the model successfully allocates the daily workforce to 3 drivers and 
facilitates weekly rest day scheduling. This approach significantly enhances operational efficiency and adherence to 
hygiene protocols in the chicken farming industry.

1. Introduction
The operation of poultry farms within the network of poultry companies in Nakhon Ratchasima and Buriram provinces 
is crucial in maintaining biological, hygienic, and health safety standards for the chickens. Biosecurity is essential for 
preventing disease outbreaks and maintaining the health of the chickens on the farms. To prevent the spread of 
pathogens, strict regulations have been established, including prohibiting employees from bringing outside food into

by reducing the total distance, minimizing overtime, and optimizing driver allocation. This improvement leads to more 
balanced and efficient operations for the farm  
 
5.4 Validation 
The validation of the effectiveness of applying the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) theory to food transportation 
route planning demonstrated significant improvements in operational efficiency. Specifically, the total daily 
transportation distance was reduced from 1,767 kilometers in scenario 1 and 1,485 kilometers in scenario 2 to shorter, 
more optimized distances according to the new plan. This reduction in distance not only minimized fuel consumption 
and transportation costs but also contributed to a lower carbon footprint. 
 
Furthermore, the new driver management strategy proved to be highly effective. By providing drivers with regular 
weekly rest days, the strategy helped to mitigate fatigue and reduce the incidence of overtime work. This improvement 
in driver welfare led to enhanced productivity and a more sustainable workforce. The drivers were able to perform 
their duties with increased efficiency, leading to smoother and more continuous operations. The implementation of 
this strategy ensured that the logistics process became more reliable and consistent, thereby improving overall service 
quality and customer satisfaction 
 
6. Conclusion 
Applying the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) theory to food transportation route planning enabled a significant 
reduction in total transportation distance, energy consumption, and operational costs. By optimizing the routes, the 
total distance traveled by delivery vehicles was substantially decreased. This not only reduced fuel consumption and 
emissions but also lowered the overall operational costs associated with transportation. The reduction in distance 
translated directly into financial savings, as less fuel was required, and vehicle wear and tear were minimized, leading 
to lower maintenance costs. 
 
Furthermore, the implementation of a new driver management approach allowed drivers to have weekly rest days 
without affecting the overall operations. This strategy improved driver welfare by ensuring they had adequate rest, 
which reduced fatigue and the risk of accidents. Well-rested drivers are more alert and efficient, contributing to safer 
and more reliable transportation operations. The regular rest days also helped in retaining drivers by improving job 
satisfaction, thus reducing turnover rates and the costs associated with hiring and training new drivers. 
 
The combination of optimized routes and improved driver management resulted in more efficient food transportation. 
The streamlined operations ensured that deliveries were timely and consistent, enhancing the reliability of the service. 
Reduced expenses and energy use contributed to a more sustainable and eco-friendly operation, aligning with broader 
environmental goals. 
 
Overall, the integration of TSP with advanced driver management practices enabled the farm network to operate more 
effectively and balanced. It demonstrated that leveraging mathematical optimization techniques, combined with 
strategic human resource management, could lead to substantial improvements in operational efficiency. This holistic 
approach ensured that the benefits were not only economic but also social and environmental, making the 
transportation system more robust and sustainable in the long term.

Abstract 
In recent years, global warming has become more serious problem because the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions is increased. Therefore, renewable energy such as solar energy should be utilized effectively to reduce GHG 
emissions. However, it is difficult to balance the supply and demand for solar energy because the output depends on 
the weather. The on-demand cumulative control method is the method of inventory control to balance between supply 
and demand dynamically. The on-demand cumulative control method involves the phase of forecasting power 
generation and consumption in order to estimate the effective power supply. However, when they are not taken into 
account the precision of forecasting electricity supply and demand, the appropriate demand-to-supply management 
might be difficult. This study analyzes the forecasting method in solar energy demand-to-supply management by 
comparing the exponential smoothing method and the random forest is implemented under the same explanatory 
variables in terms of the precision of forecasting power generation and consumption. Moreover, temperature, date, 
weekdays or holidays, and period of time are set as explanatory variables and the effect of setting them is evaluated. 
Finally, the total power purchase amount is investigated using the on-demand cumulative control method.

6. Conclusion  
This study analyzed the effect of the difference of forecasting method between the exponential smoothing method and 
random forest in the case of applying solar energy demand-to-supply management at the distribution center. The 
results showed that using random forest could be higher precision for forecasting power generation and consumption 
than using the exponential smoothing method. However, applying random forest made the total power purchase 
amount higher than using the exponential smoothing method. Therefore, the improvement of the precision for 
forecasting power generation and consumption does not necessarily mean that the total power purchase amount will 
decrease. 
 For future study, the implementing quantitative evaluation of GHG emission when the proposed method is applied to 
the solar energy demand-to-supply management is involved. This is because, considering GHG emission are helpful 
for developing more eco-friendly demand-to-supply management.

1. Introduction
Transportation is one of the key areas of efficiency and effectiveness in supply chain management, and a difficult 
problem in transportation is the vehicle routing problem (VRP) (Kumari et al. 2023). Solving transportation 
problems using this technology can provide appropriate and rapid progress in reducing travel time, reducing 
congestion, shortening the distance from the origin location to the destination location, etc. (Al-Khassawneh, 
2023). Dantzig and Ramser (1959) introduced and defined VRP as a problem in scheduling vehicle depots to 
customers by minimizing the distance of the vehicle's travel. Objectives and model categories about VRP have 
been published from 2019 to 2021 in 88 journals (Tan and Yeh 2021). Several types of VRP can be categorized 
based on objectives and constraining factors. Types of VRP based on constraining factors include Multiple Trips 
Vehicle Routing Problem (MTVRP), Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), Pickup and 
Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP), Capacities Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), VRP with Multiple 
Products, Multiple Depots Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP), Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem, VRP with 
Heterogeneous Fleet of Vehicles.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing companies in South Africa (SA) operate in a highly competitive global environment characterised by 
rapid changes in technology and increasing customer demands.  According to Ginindza (2021), SA’s global 
competitiveness has dropped to position 62 from a total of 64 countries based on data from the 2021 World 
Competitiveness Yearbook.  A number of problems have been cited, including the high unemployment rate, electricity 
issues, slow COVID vaccination rates and a struggling economy. Productivity SA indicated that SA’s performance 
has deteriorated significantly since 2005 when it was ranked at position 37, its best performance (Raputsoane, 2020). 
SA’s manufacturing industry has shrunk from 21% in 1990 to 12% in 2019 with more people employed within the 
manufacturing sector in 1969 than today (Venter, 2022).  This presents a serious challenge as more people are losing 
jobs within the manufacturing sector at a time when SA needs to create employment.  
According to Sahoo and Yadav (2017), global competition has led manufacturing companies to adopt cost-reduction 
strategies, focusing on achieving high quality and customer satisfaction.  This has resulted in many companies 
adopting and implementing Lean Manufacturing (LM) as a continuous improvement approach to enhance their 
competitiveness.  LM implementation has produced improvements to operational performance through the reduction

Abstract 
This research examines the process for merit scholarships for undergraduate students, focusing on the scholarship 
subdivision within the student affairs division of Suranaree University of Technology. The issue identified was the 
delay in receiving scholarships for students. The study aimed to 1) Examine the process of merit scholarships for 
undergraduate students, 2) Employ the fishbone diagram tool to scrutinize the factors contributing to students 
receiving scholarships that delay and 3) Aim to minimize the duration of the process for merit scholarships for 
undergraduate students. The research employed the following methods: 1) Record the work procedures as a flow 
process chart, 2) Observation of the work procedures of the general administration officers of the scholarship 
subdivision, 3) Analysis of problems through a fishbone diagram, and 4) Enhancing the process for merit scholarships 
to undergraduate students through the application of the ECRS technique. The findings attributed the primary cause 
of the students receiving scholarships to delay procedural intricacies. Consequently, these issues were addressed by 
implementing the ECRS technique to streamline operations and reduce processing time. A comparison of the process 
for merit scholarships for undergraduate students, before and after the enhancement revealed a decrease in average 
processing time from 7,119 minutes (14.83 days) to 6,075 minutes (12.65 days), signifying a 14.66 percent 
improvement.

Abstract 
Maintenance is crucial for Power Plant Company Limited to uphold efficiency in electricity production, particularly 
concerning the water pump's role in driving the system. Weekly data recording and analysis, especially on parameters 
like vibration, aid in detecting abnormalities and facilitating timely maintenance. However, manual recording poses 
issues such as errors from record data and risks to employees entering high-risk areas for measurements. The company 
integrates Industry 4.0 principles by designing an IoT-based data recording and analysis system to address this. This 
system comprises four layers: Layer one is the sensing layer using vibration sensor SW420 to receive a vibration value 
from the water pump. Layer two network layers using Heltec esp32 LoRa V3 to receive data from layer one and send 
data to the next layer, layer three data processing using MySQL and phpMyAdmin for database and analysis, and 
layer 4 application layers using Line Notify service to notice abnormal vibration from the water pump. Results indicate 
the system has an accuracy of 92.24% from the sensor and effective detection of abnormalities, ensuring stable 
operational use. Implementing this system enhances predictive and preventive maintenance capabilities, minimizes 
employee errors, and provides workplace safety.

1. Introduction
In today's power plant industry, preventive and predictive maintenance ensures efficient and uninterrupted electricity 
production. Power Plant Company Limited relies heavily on the performance of water pumps, which play a vital role 
in driving the overall system. While weekly data recording and analysis of parameters like vibration and temperature 
aid in detecting abnormalities, the current manual process poses several challenges. Firstly, manual data recording is 
prone to human errors, potentially leading to inaccurate records and compromising the effectiveness of maintenance 
activities. Secondly, employees tasked with taking measurements in high-risk areas around the water pumps are 
exposed to safety hazards, which is a significant concern. To address these issues, Power Plant Company Limited 
recognizes the need to integrate Industry 4.0 principles and leverage the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. By 
designing and implementing an IoT-based data recording and analysis system, the company aims to achieve the

in Figure 9. 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Shows a workflow diagram of employees after using the IoT system 
 
Overall, the system designed and installed can actually be used. This results in a workflow diagram, as shown in 
Figure 10. Employees do not need to enter the area to measure various values, reducing the dangers of working in 
high-risk areas. The data received is also accurate. The system can be alerted in real-time. When there is a problem, it 
can be immediately maintained, and the information obtained can be recorded to predict damage or problems with the 
water pump before they occur, leading to action. Maintenance While no serious damage has occurred preventative 
and predictive maintenance become even more effective. 
 
5. Conclusion  
After designing and installing the IoT system at the water pump, it was found that the system the project creator had 
designed was usable. The system can send and receive data to store in the database. The system can also report 
abnormalities in the water pump through the LINE application. The system is accurate, up to 92.24 % compared with 
the vibration meter. Employees are safer because they do not need to visit the worksite for measurement. and reduce 
errors in measuring various values. The by-products received from the system can increase the efficiency of preventive 
and predictive maintenance. Moreover, the life of the machine can be extended with effective maintenance.

Abstract 
This paper studied the enhancement of productivity in the lighting steel pole manufacturing process of a company 
facing issues with production rates not meeting customer demand. The primary causes of these issues are waste 
occurring in the process and inappropriate allocation of resources relative to production volumes. This study focuses 
on applying simulation techniques using Flexsim software, lean manufacturing principles, and waste reduction 
strategies as tools for improving the manufacturing process. These tools provide a virtual improvement framework 
before actual implementation, aimed at reducing time and costs associated with process enhancements. The objectives 
of this research are to create a realistic simulation model of the current manufacturing process and to develop this 
model further to propose improvement strategies for increasing the production output of lighting steel poles to meet 
target levels. In this study, three scenarios were generated plans for improving the production process were presented. 
Analysis of the simulation models indicated that the third improvement plan was the most suitable. The results 
demonstrate an increase in the production capacity of lighting steel poles from 40 poles per day to 55 poles per day, 
which is sufficient to meet current customer demands. Worker utilization increased by 16%, and line balance 
efficiency increased by 14%. Additionally, labor costs were the lowest, decreasing from $3,771 per month to $3,428 
per month due to a reduction of one worker. The developed model also provides a foundation for future alternative 
developments in response to changing customer demands and can be applied to other similar manufacturing processes.

The primary factor considered in selecting among different models is the production rate, in order to meet the target 
demand of 50 units per day. The results of all three model A, B, and C were able to meet the desired production target. 
The result was focused to worker utilization more than machine utilization because worker capacity was a major 
constraint of the system since it limited the capacity of the process. The average worker utilization of Model B and C 
were increased from the real current production model, whereas Model A experienced a decrease because increasing 
the worker by two individuals resulted in additional idle time within the process. The line balance efficiency of all 
model A, B, and C were increased from the real current production model that the idle time has been reduced. The 
labor costs of each model vary, directly proportional to the number of workers. Model C has the lowest labor cost 
among all models. The estimated operating costs will occur exclusively for Model C, as these expenses are associated 
with the relocation of machinery during the re-layout process. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper proposed alternative solutions for production management in order to improve the manufacturing process 
in the production line through alternative strategies based on basic principle of lean manufacturing. Simulation models 
showed great performance to help in making a decision before implementing alternative strategies in real systems 
. From the experiment results, group technology, plant layout, job enlargement, and capacity expansion were able to 
help reduce operating cost, increase average worker utilization, as well as increasing throughput. 
 
As a conclusion, the results showed that Model C is the optimal among of three alternatives, as it exhibits the best 
performance indicators among all strategies. It achieves an average throughput rate of 55 units per day, effectively 
meeting the increased demand from 40 units to 50 units per day. Worker utilization increased from 71% to 87%, and 
line balance efficiency improved from 58% to 72%. Additionally, labor costs were the lowest, decreasing from $3,771 
per month to $3,428 per month due to a reduction of one worker. Operational costs of $428 from the re-layout process 
are considered minimal when compared to the monthly labor costs. 
 
This study also demonstrates that simulation techniques, combined with Lean principles and ECRS techniques, can 
serve as effective decision-making tools for identifying strategies to optimally improve manufacturing process 
efficiency.

Abstract 
Parallel computing involving central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), known as 
heterogenous computing, can greatly improve computational efficiency across various scientific and engineering 
domains. The heterogeneous computing platform best suits algorithms requiring sequential and parallel processing. A 
GPU with shallow pipelines, short caches, and numerous threads doing sequential tasks is connected to a CPU with a 
more complex hardware design via a PCIe bus. It is crucial to note that the complexity of heterogeneous computing 
and the time cost of transporting input data to the GPU for processing and obtaining output results from the GPU is 
useless if the time cost is greater than the savings from processing the data on the GPU. Therefore, to take advantage 
of heterogeneous computing, the best candidates for optimization problems are those that compute on the same data 
multiple times. In this research, the researchers proposed the concept of “solution batching” to take advantage of fewer 
data transfer operations between the CPU and GPU. The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is utilized to verify the 
suitability of the innovative technique in improving heterogeneous computing. Additionally, the nature of the QAP 
problem and solution batching, the obstacles and difficulties, and the possibility of implementation will also be 
covered in this investigation.

Abstract 
Japan is facing a rapid and continuing decrease in the number of younger people as the outcomes of population 
decrease, low birthrate, and population aging. Even in the vicinities of Metropolitan districts, municipalities must 
begin or have started planning core school restructures including school consolidation and closure. Not only the 
decrease in the number of students but also the teacher shortage must be taken into account. To find an objective plan, 
mathematical methods known as facility layout optimization can be utilized. The maximum covering problem (MCLP) 
is adopted to seek optimal layout plans, amongst several candidates. Because the traditional model does not reflect the 
capacities of facilities, the traditional model is modified to incorporate the capacities of facilities. A case study is 
conducted for Machida City, located southernmost of Tokyo. The city plans to reduce the number of public elementary 
schools from 42 to 26 by the year 2040, considering the declining birthrate and aging school buildings. Comparisons 
are made on the traditional and capacitated models. The results highlight that even if the number of schools is reduced 
to 26 from the current number of 42, the population coverage decreases by only 1% with the help of the MCLP-based 
approach.

1. Introduction
Many facility allocation models are available in urban planning. Given a set of users and candidate locations, a facility
allocation problem aims to find the number of facilities and the corresponding optimal facility locations. Traditional
facility location-allocation problems take into account the marginal distance between users and facilities. The
maximum covering problem first formalized by Church and ReVelle (1974) is pioneering research; the problem
maximizes the demand coverage within a standard distance. On the other hand, in actual urban planning, it is common
to adapt to changes in social needs and conditions by establishing new facilities, consolidating, and/or abolishing
existing facilities. Along with financial restrictions, an effective use of existing facilities and resources is pivotal. In
Japan, the circumstances surrounding public facilities have become critical in recent years due to composite changes
such as population decrease, low birthrate, population aging, and needs by diversification of residents. About the
declining birthrate problem in Japan, the number of children in public elementary schools in Tokyo metropolitan is
expected to decrease by 8% over the next five years, and by 18% over the next 10 years. Therefore, some
municipalities in Tokyo have begun making restructuring plans along with consolidation and closures of schools. For

5. Conclusion 
Two decades ago, Japan began facing a rapid and continuing decrease in the number of younger people as the multiple 
outcomes of population decrease, low birthrate, and population aging. Not a few municipalities must tackle this along 
with a school restructuring plan. Not only the continuing decrease in the number of students, but also the teacher 
shortage must be taken into account. School consolidation would be a central solution to achieve sustainability of 
elementary education, while residents must be patient with elongated commuting distances. 
 
Considering these, a benchmark study was conducted for a city in Tokyo Metropolitan. To yield an objective 
consolidation, a traditional service coverage model called MCLP is adopted. Derived from this, a capacitated model 
that averts excessing capacity is constructed. A case study was conducted for Machida City, located southernmost of 
Tokyo, where there are currently 42 elementary schools. Experimental results with the traditional MCLP revealed 
that: even if the number of schools is reduced to 26 from the current number 42, the population coverage would not 
decrease by more than 1%. The results also show that the coverage rate does not change when comparing the cases 
for 25, 26, and 27 schools. A key finding is that there would not be a severe problem even if a further decrease is 
enforced: a solution better than the current plan might exist to cope with the aging and teacher shortage. The 
experimental results of the capacitated model resulted in a population coverage of 49.7%. The optimal placement of 
the capacitated model appears to be densely populated compared to the optimal outlet of the traditional model. For the 
planned target of 26 schools, the maximum number of students that could be covered was 12,116, while the actual 
number of students covered was 9,728, along with a capacity utilization of 80.3%.

Abstract 
This research studied a multi-echelon sustainable supply chain network design problem (SSCNDP) with three 
objectives: economic, environmental, and social. This study used a pharmaceutical supply chain as a case study to 
construct a corresponding mathematical model and applied a fuzzy multi-objective approach to solve the proposed 
multi-objective SSCNDP using IBM ILOG CPLEX software. The results show that the proposed methodology can 
solve the SSCNDP through numerical testing cases. Furthermore, this study performed several sensitivity analyses for 
key parameters and discussed their results. The findings of this study could help managers make better decisions on 
their SSCNDP.

Abstract 
The competitive market pressures organizations to maximize profits, reduce resource consumption, and eliminate 
waste, necessitating the manufacturing industry to enhance its competitiveness and bolster its role in the local and 
national economy. Despite its importance, the integration of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) within the 
manufacturing industry needs to be studied more. This study investigates existing frameworks, applications, and 
challenges of incorporating LSS and I4.0 in manufacturing through a systematic literature review (SLR) and 
bibliometric analysis of 30 publications from the Scopus database since the emergence of this integration. The findings 
reveal the need for a strategic, comprehensive, and practical framework to guide the manufacturing sector in adopting 
LSS and I4.0. Applying LSS along with I4.0 leads evidently to greater efficiency, lower operational costs, improved 
productivity, enhanced customer satisfaction, and better quality. This research provides practitioners, academics, and 
professionals with valuable insights into integrating LSS and I4.0 in manufacturing and its impact on organizational 
performance. However, the quality of available literature and potential biases in the selected search terms and 
databases represent significant limitations of the study.

Introduction 
The competitive market has driven organizations to maximize profits, reduce resource consumption, and eliminate 
waste (Silva et al. 2018). This has led to growing interest in developing and applying continuous improvement 
methodologies to enhance competitiveness (Antony et al. 2023). Industry 4.0 (I4.0), a high-tech initiative from 
Germany, promotes automation through digital technologies, enabling real-time data input for service systems and 
manufacturing analysis (Arcidiacono et al. 2012). I4.0 fosters significant operational improvements influenced by 
social, economic, and political dynamics (Lasi et al. 2014) and is crucial for digital transformation in businesses (Gadre 
and Deoskar  2020). Key I4.0 technologies, such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), IoT, big data, automation, cloud 
computing, Blockchain, AI, and data sharing, integrate seamlessly into value chains, making organizations agile and 
responsive (Anvari et al. 2021; Hirsch-Kreinsen 2016). Strategically I4.0 enhances productivity, cost efficiency, 
quality, customer satisfaction, and reduces lead times (Bibby and Dehe 2018; Lu 2017). 
Among continuous improvement methodologies, Lean Six Sigma (LSS) has gained prominence for reducing waste 
and variation (George 2002) and has seen extensive global adoption due to its ability to enhance efficiency, 
competitiveness, and profitability (Snee 2010; Antony et al. 2023). As organizations digitize with I4.0, Lean, and LSS, 
have evolved into the technologically enabled LSS 4.0 initiative (Antony et al. 2021), aiming for operational

Abstract 
The rise of information and communication technology (ICT) tools as well as the emergence of new technologies has 
provided wider opportunities for business and trade to thrive, not only during but especially in the post-pandemic era. 
With the global pandemic that began in 2019, there was a greater appreciation of the digital economy. There are new 
opportunities that have arisen from e-commerce that boost growth and consumer welfare; hence, the opportunities and 
benefits of cross-border e-commerce are a subject worthy of analysis. The objective of this paper is to make an analysis 
and utilize SHEIN as a case study to document and benchmark its success stories as it stood out with cross-border e-
commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic and even afterward, specifically in the areas of supply chain advantages. 
Based on the literature, studying Shein can provide experiences, best practices, and lessons for other cross-border e-
commerce companies, as well as promote the development of other emerging companies’ e-commerce industries. 
Findings revealed that the major reasons that contributed to Shein’s remarkable success in cross-border e-commerce 
operations are its design and trends, production, distribution, supply chain management, and customer feedback. 
Following Shein’s ultra-fast fashion business model, it is expected that subsequent guidelines that are needed in the 
way the clothes are produced and how the value chain is shaped may be developed so that its lessons and successes 
can be well documented for benchmarking purposes.

Introduction 
The rise of information and communication technology (ICT) tools as well as the emergence of new technologies has 
provided wider opportunities for business and trade to thrive, not only during but especially in the post-pandemic era. 
With the global pandemic that began in 2019, there was a greater appreciation of the digital economy. It was during 
the past years that e-commerce and cross-border electronic business, or online transactions (in the buying and selling 
of goods), became more apparent and useful, and they have emerged as prominent means of doing business both in 
national and international trade. While we believe that new opportunities have arisen from e-commerce that boost 
growth and consumer welfare, the opportunities and benefits of e-commerce require an understanding of what e-
commerce and cross-border e-commerce are today.  
E-commerce takes place through a range of different commercial relationships, involving any possible pairing of
consumers (C), businesses (B), or governments (G). These include classical B2B transactions, which still account for
the lion’s share of turnover resulting from private sector e-commerce, as well as business-to-government (B2G)
transactions (e.g., government procurement). E-commerce transactions increasingly involve consumers directly, most

Abstract 
In this paper, we develop a model for bed allocation problems under Indonesia's National Health Insurance Scheme 
(Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional - JKN) managed by the Social Security Organizing Body (Badan Penyelenggara 
Jaminan Sosial - BPJS). This scheme categorizes patients and beds into three insurance classes. However, patients 
often face bed shortages in their designated classes. To address these bed shortages and the consequences of patients 
residing in beds other than those of their designated classes, we propose a bed allocation model using an overflow 
queueing model with repacking: when a patient arrives and finds all beds in its treatment class occupied, according to 
the BPJS-JKN the patient will be put in the first higher class bed and transferred immediately to its original class as 
soon as a bed is available in that class. We obtain a product form expression for the stationary distribution of bed 
occupancy, allowing explicit evaluation of various performance measures, including the blocking probabilities. 
Furthermore, we maximize the expected profit from the inpatient care under the BPJS-JKN health insurance scheme. 
Using the model, we develop a capacity planning tool to maximize the total revenue. To illustrate our model, we apply 
our model to our partnering hospital in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

Abstract 
In recent years, hot-desking has been introduced to improve worker productivity and increase opportunities for 
innovation through interactions between collaborating departments. However, when workers are free to choose their 
own seats, problems arise such as fixed seating due to biased preferences. In addition, when workers work together, 
they may prefer to be seated close to their co-workers instead of individually selecting their own seats. In contrast, 
office managers expect increased opportunities for innovation by placing departments that often collaborate with each 
other on the same office floor. However, no model exists that considers a worker's positional relationship with his or 
her co-workers in selecting seats. In contrast, office managers expect increased innovation opportunities by placing 
collaborating departments on the same office floor. However, simply assigning workers to seats near workers in other 
departments makes it difficult for them to cooperate within their departments. But there is no model that considers 
complementarity between departments to improve operational efficiency. What is needed is a seating assignment 
model that considers not only workers' seating preferences but also their relationships with co-workers and facilitates 
inter-departmental collaboration.In this study, worker externalities are represented by a network that represents the 
strength of the relationship between collaborators, and office complementarities is represented by a utility function 
that ideally assumes that workers from various departments congregate in a single booth. We propose an algorithm to 
search for two-sided many-to-one matching with the above two properties.

Abstract 
Cooperative platooning between multiple companies can lead to improved efficiency by increasing the opportunities 
for forming a better platoon. A platoon service provider (PSP) is an entity that facilitates and manages the formation 
and operation of vehicle platoons from the same or different companies, and the hubs distributed throughout the 
highway network can act as PSPs. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables the exchange of information 
between vehicles and various entities including road infrastructures and so on. Specifically, vehicle-to-hub (V2H) 
communication allows motorway hubs to collect information on incoming vehicles. V2H can consider both vehicles 
scheduled to arrive at a hub and those currently staying at the hub, allowing PSPs to coordinate better platoons and 
maximize energy savings. This study aims to design an optimal system of platoon coordination service for vehicles 
from multiple companies visiting the motorway hub considering V2H communication. The hub collects information 
such as maximum waiting time, expected arrival time, and vehicle type about incoming vehicles within the data 
exchange point in advance. The data exchange point refers to the extent to which the hub can collect information about 
incoming vehicles. The wider the data exchange point, the more information the hub can collect about more vehicles 
incoming to the hub. In this study, the effect of changing the data exchange point on efficient platoon management is 
compared and analyzed. The results proved that the earlier the information is provided, the more efficient platooning 
schedule is derived.

Abstract 
Carbon cap-and-trade is installed in many countries to give economic incentives for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction. 
Each country or region introduced an individual carbon market so that GHG emission allowance and carbon price 
differ in countries. However, since a supply chain network is constructed globally, different GHG emission allowances 
and carbon prices among countries need to be considered simultaneously for GHG reduction with an affordable cost 
using a carbon cap-and-trade system. Moreover, customs duty, FTAs, GHG emissions, and procurement costs are also 
different among countries due to different energy mix and economic situations. This study models a global supply 
chain network with custom duty, FTAs, and carbon cap-and-trade under different GHG emission allowances, and 
carbon prices among countries using integer programming. Sensitivity analysis of carbon price is conducted to analyze 
impacts on total costs, GHG emissions, and supply chain configuration. It was found cases in the numerical 
experiments that required carbon prices in 2030 and 2050 to reduce GHG emissions such as 215 and 670 [USD/t-
CO2eq] were effective for GHG and cost reductions under carbon cap-and-trade.

5.4 Comparing Two Scenarios to Change Carbon Price for carbon neutrality in 2050 
2 scenarios that Japan raises its carbon price later or earlier than other countries were compared in this section. 
Comparing these scenarios, it would be better to raise Japanese carbon price later than other countries since the 
scenario of Japan raising earlier had cases that GHG emissions could not be reduced as shown in Table 4. Moreover, 
the scenario of Japan raising later could reduce much GHG emissions in 5 out of 7 cases as shown in Table 3. 
Regarding factories, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur were selected as factory locations in all cases. Comparing suppliers, 
if carbon price in Japan is raised earlier in Section 5.3, many Chinese suppliers were selected so that the amount of 
reduction of GHG emission was smaller. Additionally, parts were sourced from the U.S. only when carbon price in 
all countries reached 670 [USD/t-CO2eq]. On the other hand, in the case of raising Japanese carbon price later, many 
Japanese supplier were selected.  
 
Based on these results, the 3 heaviest parts (#9, #10, and #14) and the 2 highest parts of GHG emissions (#12 and #16) 
should be supplied from Japan or the U.S. to reduce GHG emissions in carbon cap-and-trade. Also, all other parts 
would be better to be supplied from Malaysia to save procurement cost. 
In addition, comparing reduction results and reduction targets, if carbon prices are set as 215 [USD/t-CO2eq], the 
target of 45% reduction will be achieved. Moreover, while this model cannot achieve carbon neutrality, when carbon 
prices were set as 670 [USD/t-CO2eq], GHG emissions reduced by about 70%. Therefore, the reported carbon price 
such as 215 and 670 [USD/t-CO2eq] would be effective in the numerical experiments. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Studies 
This study models a global supply chain network with carbon cap-and-trade, custom duties, and FTAs. Different 
carbon price depending on countries are modeled base on Kinoshita et al. (2023). A mathematical model is proposed 
to determine suppliers, factory locations, and the number of transported parts/products. The design example was 
illustrated using a vacuum clear, and analyzed different carbon price in each country and different scenarios to reach 
670 [USD/t-CO2eq] of carbon price in all countries. Results and discussions indicated that Japan would raise its carbon 
price in carbon cap-and-trade later to reduce GHG emissions in supply chain. Carbon prices of 215 and 670 [USD/t-
CO2eq] reported by Suk et al. (2022) would be effective in the numerical experiments to achieve Japanese 46% 
reduction in 2030 compared to 2013 level, and carbon neutrality in 2050. 
Future studies should consider implementing mix carbon policies consisted of carbon tax and carbon cap-and-trade 
with different carbon prices across countries.

Abstract 
Sustainable Human Resource Management (SHRM) plays an important role in environmentally friendly 
organisations, as its practices and policies respect human beings and natural resources in line with the economic, social 
and environmental pillars of sustainability. A tremendous rise in the significance of sustainable organisations has been 
observed over the last previous years. However, academic research currently lacks a coherent conceptualisation and 
empirical operationalisation of the concept of sustainable employee performance. Moreover, very little is known on 
the relationship between SHRM and sustainable employee performance. Therefore, the aim of this systematic 
literature review is to analyse their relationship and provide an understanding of how the implementation of SHRM 
practices can help to achieve sustainable employee performance. Articles have been extracted from google scholar 
and Scopus database. They were selected based on the PRISMA framework. After a detailed analysis, research trends 
have been identified and research gaps have been uncovered. Thus, this study has contributed to the literature of  the 
relationship between SHRM and sustainable employee performance. A conceptual framework that can advance 
knowledge in this field has also been proposed.

1.Introduction
The whole world is facing an increasing demand and challenges of sustainable development such as overpopulation, 
climate change, social inequities and environmental problems due to which many organisations are committed to 
include sustainability in their operations (Järlström et al. 2023). Faisal (2023) stated that businesses can achieve 
sustainable business development by becoming more aware of social and environmental issues and thus adopt 
environmental objectives and economic goals when formulating objectives. Therefore, the concept of sustainability is 
being spanned on several management disciplines including human resource management (HRM), supply chain 
management, knowledge management, strategic management, marketing, operations and production (Kainzbauer et 
al.2021). In the area of HRM, the process of incorporating sustainability, have led to the emergence of a new approach 
known as the sustainable human resource management (SHRM). 
Ehnert et al. (2016), defined SHRM “as the adoption of HRM strategies and practices that enable the achievement of 
financial, social and ecological goals, with an impact inside and outside of the organisation and over a long-term time 
horizon while controlling the unintended side effects and negative feedback. Additionally, Ehnert (2009a) stated that

Abstract 
In recent years, the second-hand market in Electronic Commerce (EC) platforms has grown. The trading of second-
hand product enables the protect the environment by conserving natural resources, reducing production costs of the 
equivalent new products, and preventing the second-hand products from becoming waste. On the other hand, it is 
difficult for second-hand products to determine the selling price. To evaluate the selling price of second-hand products 
without personal bias, it is necessary to predict prices based on objective information such as specifications and quality 
of the second-hand product. Hedonic regression is well known to use the prediction for values such as real property 
and product. This approach is expected to objectively determine prices based on multiple factors, such as specifications 
and quality, inherent in second-hand products. This study proposes the hedonic regression model for second-hand 
laptops on the EC platform. First, proposed hedonic regression procedures are illustrated for predicting the selling 
prices of second-hand laptops. Second, the hedonic regression model is formulated using specification information 
and quality information. Third, the data processing process is described based on exploratory data analysis. Finally, 
the proposed regression model is analyzed and discussed.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
In recent years, the second-hand market in Electronic Commerce (EC) platforms has grown (Ministry of Economy,
Trade and Industry 2021). One of the advantages of the trading in EC platform is that customers can find out the
specifications and quality of second-hand products without having to visit a physical store. Additionally, the trading
of second-hand products enables to protection of the environment by conserving natural resources, reducing
production costs of the equivalent new products, and preventing second-hand products from becoming waste (Yeh et
al. 2011). On the other hand, since second-hand products vary, their potential value is not known in advance (Nakajima
et al. 2020). Therefore, this makes it difficult to procure second-hand products, predict sales profits, and determine
the selling price. To evaluate the selling price of second-hand products without personal bias, it is necessary to predict
prices based on objective information such as specifications and quality of the second-hand product. Hedonic
regression is a well-known method for predicting the values or the demand of a product (Diewert 2003). It applies
multiple regression techniques to large data sets and requires a formal basis in microeconomic theory (Helim 2009).
Therefore, the hedonic regression is expected to objectively determine prices based on the multiple factors, such as
specifications and quality, which are inherent in second-hand products.

6. Conclusion
This study proposes the hedonic regression model for the second-hand product of laptops on EC platform. From results 
it can be considered that the quality information has more influence than the specification information Future works 
should design demand model of customer for the second-hand product. Furthermore, it is need to examine the 
compatibility of the seller's sales price model and the buyer's demand model.

Abstract 
This paper presents a strategy that controls the formation of vehicle platoons while driving and maintains the target 
formation. Before reaching destinations, platoons can be affected by unpredictable factors such as an error in wireless 
communication, malfunctioning sensors, and weather conditions. These factors can lead to the transformation of 
platoon formations, with their shapes being randomly determined. Therefore, this paper focuses on returning to the 
target formation from the randomly determined changes while minimizing the loss of energy savings. To account for 
this randomness, the model treats unpredictable factors as variables that can affect formation, leading to the 
development of two mathematical models. Both models have a common purpose of minimizing the loss of energy 
savings, but one model consists of a platoon directed by the leading vehicle to minimize the loss of energy savings for 
all vehicles in the platoon, while the other model consists of a platoon in which each agent minimizes its own loss of 
energy savings. Furthermore, safety for vehicle platoons should be considered when platooning. To consider this, 
penalties related to velocity that determine the gap between adjacent vehicles are added to the developed model. To 
identify the most appropriate method for real-world application, simulations are conducted using an algorithm suitable 
for a stochastic dynamic game, based on the developed mathematical models.

Abstract 
 
Due to various factors, such as the significant decrease in international travel and the restrictions on indoor activities 
and gatherings caused by the pandemic, the demand for golf rounds has surged. This increase has led to a rise in green 
fees by more than 30%. However, in Korea, the golf industry is facing a crisis as the number of golfers decreases due 
to the end of COVID-19 and the associated cost burden. In this situation, this study proposes a marketing product that 
connects screen-golf and field-golf to retain golfers and maintain stable revenues for the golf industry. The proposed 
marketing product incorporates the concept of a loyalty program that provides a coupon for field-golf after a certain 
number of screen golf. In other words, it rewards purchase behavior. This study classified customer clusters based on 
their characteristics and determine the number of issues for each coupon by considering the response rates to coupons 
by cluster. Mathematical modeling and optimization techniques of operations research were utilized to find optimal 
decision-making in various scenarios. Additionally, game theory was adopted to analyze the reasonable decisions for 
screen golf and field golf stores based on their competitive and cooperative relationships. Through this study, it is 
expected that the decline in the golf population can be prevented, and the revisit rate can be increased, thereby enabling 
stable revenue management in the golf industry.

Abstract 
The research explores the transformative integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into technological entrepreneurship 
education, addressing significant gaps in traditional pedagogical methods, particularly those outlined in Bloom’s 
Taxonomy. Despite various revisions, Bloom’s framework is increasingly inadequate in meeting the dynamic and 
complex demands of modern educational environments. The study proposes an innovative AI-enhanced educational 
model that positions AI as a central element in the learning ecosystem. This model conceptualizes AI’s roles as an 
Advisor, Mediator, and Supplementary Assistant, facilitating more personalized, efficient, and collaborative 
educational experiences. The research methodology includes a comprehensive literature review and an in-depth case 
study of a technological entrepreneurship course. The findings demonstrate that AI significantly enhances traditional 
methods by providing real-time feedback, automating routine tasks, and bolstering cognitive processes such as 
analyzing, evaluating, and creating. AI’s capability to personalize learning experiences, support collaborative projects, 
and aid decision-making is highlighted as crucial for modernizing education in the digital age. Furthermore, the study 
underscores the importance of ethical considerations and robust governance in AI’s deployment, advocating for a 
balanced integration that complements rather than replaces human cognitive processes. This research contributes to 
the ongoing discourse on the future of education by offering a structured, scalable framework for AI integration, with 
significant practical implications for educators and policymakers aiming to enhance teaching and learning processes 
through advanced AI technologies.

Abstract 
The plastic products sector in Peru plays a crucial role as a strategic ally for various industries, due to the versatility 
of plastic products in multiple applications. However, it faces significant challenges, including a high rate of order 
returns, which generates considerable economic losses and affects operational efficiency. Warehouse management 
with Lean techniques, particularly Lean Warehousing, has shown a potential to improve operational efficiency and 
reducing waste, although its application in the warehouse context requires further research. One of the urgent problems 
in the sector is the inefficient management of inventories and order preparation, resulting in delays and errors in 
deliveries. This study proposes a warehouse management model based on Lean tools such as Value Stream Mapping 
(VSM), slotting, and visual control principles, with the aim of reducing the return rate and improving warehouse 
management efficiency. Necessary actions include the implementation of VSM to identify non-value-added activities, 
the use of slotting to optimize product placement, and the adoption of visual controls to improve order preparation 
accuracy. Key findings of the research show a significant reduction in the order return rate, from 17.65% to 10.5%, 
and an improvement in operational efficiency with a 10% increase in the order fulfillment rate. Additionally, the 
implementation of the Lean Warehousing model led to a 15% reduction in operational costs and a 12% increase in 
warehouse productivity. The academic impact of this research is reflected in the contribution to the body of knowledge 
on the application of Lean techniques in warehouse management, while the socio-economic impact includes improved 
competitiveness of companies in the plastic sector and reduced operational costs, benefiting both companies and end 
consumers. This study calls for action for researchers and industry professionals to explore new directions in the 
implementation of Lean techniques in warehouses, focusing on adapting tools to specific contexts and evaluating their 
long-term impact. The adoption of these practices can result in significant improvements in operational efficiency and 
the economic sustainability of companies.

1.Introduction
Organizations have made continuous efforts for a long time to adopt management tools and techniques for the 
continuous improvement of their processes. Thus, all of these are focused on the Lean concept (Paredes et al.2018; 
Villareal et al. 2016; Shah & Khanzod 2017; Bellido et al. 2017). Lean thinking has become one of the most influential 
management philosophies in the efficient management environment. Among its applications, we note the inclusion of 
good practices to reduce the impact of problems generated by inadequate control of its main operations. Among the

With the Arena simulator, the optimal N was found to equal 587 repetitions. With this, the simulator was run again to 
obtain the reports, both of the current situation and of the short-term, medium-term and long-term improvement 
situations. In this way, the following results were obtained, which are shown in the following table.

5.  Conclusions 
This research study details a case study and identifies the main problem and its causes.  In this way, it is determined 
that the main problem is the high rate of returns on orders in a plastic products distribution company, which is 
equivalent to a return rate of 17.65% and represents an economic impact of approximately 380,639 PEN. 
 
For the validation of the solution proposal, the Arena simulator was used, using distributions obtained with real data 
from the company under study and working with a confidence level of 95%. In this way, results were obtained that 
allow to analyze various scenarios. 
Through the reports generated by the Arena simulator, it is concluded that the implementation of the solution proposal 
increases the level of care from 80.98% (current situation) to 90.67% (long-term improvement situation), which is 
equivalent to an increase of 9.69%. Also, the reports of the simulator Arena show that the cost of 79,426 PEN (current 
situation) is reduced to 69,582 PEN (long-term improvement situation), which is equivalent to a reduction of 12.39%. 
 
Future recommendations 
Because there is a shortage of information in the literature about the implementation of Lean tools in warehouses, it 
is recommended to develop future in-depth research on the implementation of Lean Warehouses to contribute to the 
literature and to the improvement of warehouse management. It is recommended to emphasize the training of 
personnel so that, as far as possible, mistakes in the implementation of the solution proposal can be avoided; as well, 
to be able to comply with the deliverables according to the established schedule. It is recommended to continuously 
monitor the progress of the project to comply with everything previously proposed.

Abstract 
The metal-mechanical industry, particularly the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), plays a critical role in 
economic development globally, especially in Latin America and Peru. Previous studies have highlighted the 
importance of this sector in fostering industrial growth and innovation. Despite its significance, SMEs in this sector 
face numerous production challenges, including deficiencies in machine setups, operational errors leading to rework, 
and inadequate inventory management, which disrupt supply chains and affect overall efficiency. This research aimed 
to address these urgent challenges by proposing a Lean Manufacturing-based production model tailored for SMEs in 
the metal-mechanical industry. The proposed model incorporated Lean Manufacturing tools such as Poka Yoke, 
SMED, 5S, Kanban, and A3 reports to streamline production processes and enhance operational performance. The 
model focused on reducing setup times, minimizing operational errors, and optimizing inventory management. 
Through a structured implementation of these tools, the model sought to eliminate waste and improve production 
efficiency, thereby ensuring timely order fulfillment and high product quality. 
Key findings from the study showed significant improvements in several performance indicators. The on-time delivery 
rate improved from 66.40% to 87.85%, setup times were reduced by 30.11%, productivity increased by 28.00%, and 
cycle times decreased by 23.77%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Lean Manufacturing 
model in addressing the critical production issues faced by SMEs in the metal-mechanical sector. The impact of this 
research extends beyond operational improvements. Academically, it contributes to the existing body of knowledge 
on Lean Manufacturing applications in SMEs, providing a robust framework for future studies. Socioeconomically, 
the enhanced production efficiency and reliability can lead to increased competitiveness and sustainability for SMEs, 
fostering economic stability and growth within the region. In conclusion, this study calls for further exploration and 
validation of Lean Manufacturing tools in diverse industrial settings. The demonstrated success of the proposed model 
highlights the potential for broader application, encouraging researchers and practitioners to continue innovating and 
refining production processes to meet evolving market demands and technological advancements.

Abstract 
The robustness of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models is a cornerstone for their effectiveness and 
trustworthiness in high-stakes environments. As AI technologies permeate sensitive areas such as environmental 
monitoring and energy management, the demand for models that not only perform consistently but also offer 
transparent decision-making processes intensifies. This study introduces a transformative methodological innovation 
in XAI that significantly enhances the robustness and interpretability of predictive models. Employing advanced 
machine learning algorithms—XGBoost, Multi-layer Perceptron, and Keras Sequential Neural Networks—integrated 
with leading-edge XAI tools like Tree SHAP, Kernel SHAP, and Deep SHAP, our framework sets a new standard in 
the fidelity and accountability of AI systems.Central to our methodology is the development of two novel metrics: the 
Stability Correlation Index (SCI) and the Explanation Integrity Metric (EIM). These metrics are specifically designed 
to critically evaluate the stability and reliability of explanations provided by AI models across varied and unpredictable 
data landscapes. By quantifying the consistency of model explanations under dynamic conditions, these metrics 
address a crucial gap in current AI practices—ensuring that AI systems remain robust against data perturbations and 
environmental changes, which is essential for their deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract 
The Peruvian textile MSE industry faces significant operational and management challenges, impacting its 
competitiveness and sustainability. Previous studies have shown that the implementation of methodologies such as 
Lean Manufacturing can optimize processes and improve efficiency in small and medium-sized manufacturing sectors. 
However, there is a gap in the specific application of these methodologies in the textile jeans manufacturing industry, 
particularly in supplier management and quality control. Textile MSEs frequently deal with problems such as delays 
in the delivery of raw materials, operational errors that generate rework, and inadequate planning and inventory. These 
challenges affect the profitability, reputation, and competitive capacity of these companies. It is urgent to address 
these problems to ensure their long-term growth and sustainability. In response to these challenges, a production model 
based on Lean Manufacturing was developed, integrating tools such as Poka Yoke, work-study, and supplier 
management. This model included an initial diagnosis, personnel awareness activities, process analysis and 
optimization, implementation of Poka Yoke mechanisms to avoid errors, and rigorous supplier management. These 
actions sought to eliminate waste and improve production efficiency and quality. 
The results showed a 26.98% improvement in order fulfillment, a 98.21% reduction in reworked products in the 
embroidery area, and a 92.97% decrease in errors due to incorrect thread selection. In addition, late delivery of 
products due to lack of raw materials was reduced by 98.29%, and non-standardized registrations decreased by 
96.57%.The research has a significant impact both academically and socioeconomically. Academically, it provides a 
practical model for the application of Lean Manufacturing in textile MSEs, filling a gap in the existing literature. 
Socioeconomically, it improves the competitiveness and sustainability of MSEs, contributing to local and national 
economic development. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to explore new research directions, integrating 
Industry 4.0 technologies with Lean methodologies, and evaluating their long-term impact in different operational 
contexts. This research is an important step toward process optimization in the textile industry, but much remains to 
be discovered and improved.

6. Conclusions 
The study developed has allowed to identify and address the main causes of non-fulfillment of orders in a textile MSE 
dedicated to the manufacture of denim garments. The most significant findings include the high incidence of 
reprocesses (39.77%), delays in the delivery of raw materials (30.36%) and the lack of knowledge of the inventory of 
finished products (22.29%). Through the implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools, such as Poka Yoke and 
supplier management, a significant reduction in production errors and cycle times was achieved. In addition, an 
objective evaluation system was established for the selection of suppliers, which improved the quality and timeliness 
of the raw material received, resulting in a decrease in the order noncompliance indicator from 37% to 10%.The 
research conducted is of great importance because it addresses critical problems that affect the competitiveness and 
sustainability of textile MSEs. The implementation of Lean methodologies not only optimizes production processes, 
but also promotes an organizational culture of continuous improvement and commitment to quality. This is crucial in 
a context where operational efficiency and the ability to meet delivery deadlines are crucial to maintain customer 
loyalty and compete in global markets. 
 
The contributions of this study to the field of industrial engineering are varied. First, it provides a practical and 
effective model for the application of Lean Manufacturing in textile MSEs, a sector that has traditionally faced 
significant challenges in supply chain management and quality control. Second, it highlights the importance of 
rigorous, quantitative-based supplier management, which is essential to ensure consistency and quality of inputs. 
Third, it demonstrates the positive impact of error-proofing tools such as Poka Yoke in reducing rework and improving 
accuracy in production processes. 
 
Finally, observations and suggestions for further study include the need to explore the integration of Industry 4.0 
technologies with Lean methodologies, which could provide an additional layer of real-time control and optimization 
of production processes. Longitudinal studies are also recommended to assess the sustained impact of these 
improvements over time and in different operating contexts. In addition, it would be beneficial to investigate the 
applicability of these approaches in other manufacturing sectors to validate their versatility and effectiveness in 
different industries.

Abstract 
Food waste negatively affects the planet, people, and economy.  The issue of food waste is an increasing source of 
concern for suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, and end consumers, mainly in the era of online shopping. This study 
aims to (i) reveal the major causes of waste across the online food supply chain (O-FSC), (ii) identify the food waste 
mitigation and destination strategies, (iii) measure food waste contribution at each supply stream, and (iv) impose 
practical policies and practices for decision/policymakers to boost food waste management for the case country food 
waste in an O-FSC. This research used a mixed-method approach to deliver research objectives. First, the literature 
was thoroughly analysed via template analysis to surface food waste management throughout supply chains, focusing 
on three aspects: food waste enablers, destinations, and mitigation strategies. Second, structured interviews and 
surveys were employed to collect data from a leading regional retailer and consumers, respectively. The template 
analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the collected data. This research highlights key waste enablers

Abstract 
Supply chain managers are under pressure to accommodate multiple demands in their decision-making processes, 
including considering environmentally friendly, resilient, and digitally integrated supply chains. However, a supplier 
selection and order allocation (SS/OA) solution that integrates such demands has not yet been identified. Thus, this 
article proposes a framework that integrates digitalization, economic, green, and resilient SS/OA criteria and tests this 
framework using multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) algorithms and multi-objective optimization approach 
methodologies. The applied methodologies can help purchasing managers to better evaluate suppliers based on 
multiple criteria and take direct action towards improving priority areas and order allocation. For example, a multi-
tier supply chain approach is necessary to navigate multiple demands. This article advances the current debate on 
supplier selection by proposing and testing an integrated framework, called ‘digitalized econogresilience’. This 
econogresilience is a portmanteau word created by combining the terms ""economic"", “green” and ""resilience,"" and it 
describes the ability of an economic system, organization, or society to absorb shocks, adapt, and recover from them 
while preserving or swiftly recovering its stability and usefulness while remaining green.

The order allocation plan might change when focused on different objectives since each Pareto solution might yield a 
different order allocation plan with respect to objective values. For example, solution 1 in Table 9 requires a minimum 
related cost of 408,420; nevertheless, the desired value of digitalized econogresilient purchasing at its minimum value 
equals 312. Likewise, in solution 10 in Table 8, the desired value of econogresilient purchasing is maximized to 900, 
whereas the undesired value of related cost is increased to 1,173,666. This reflects the contradiction between the two 
objectives. In other words, the purchasing team must spend more money to improve their digitalized econogresilience 
status. Finally, the decision to select one solution was discussed with the purchasing manager; the optimal solution 
can be determined based on the purchasing team’s preferences or using mathematical algorithms.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Supplier selection is a multi-criteria decision-making problem that must take into account several qualitative and 
quantitative criteria. A supplier selection and order allocation strategy should be digitalized, resilient, and green to be 
able to handle unexpected events/disruptions, increases in environmental regulation, and high demand for e-
commerce. Thus, an integrated methodology that helps decision-makers obtain a digitalized, green, and resilient 
SS/OA is essential; this article advances the current debate on the sourcing decision-making process in proposing and 
testing an integrated digitalized econogresilience framework. Overall, this paper makes an original contribution to the 
field of sourcing decision-making by extending previous work, which considered either sustainability and resilience 
or resilience and digitalization criteria for the SS/OA problem. This article integrates four critical pillars related to the 
SS/OA problem: digitalized, economic, resilient, and green.

Abstract 
The franchise business sector, particularly in the food industry, has demonstrated significant growth and widespread 
branch distribution. However, a challenge arises when a franchised stall has a single worker who must make decisions 
regarding preparing cooked products. Given these food items' limited one-day shelf life, it becomes crucial to strike a 
balance between meeting in-day demand and minimizing end-of-day leftovers. This paper aims to enhance the 
efficiency of product sales preparation in franchised food stalls by presenting a more effective method for planning 
and control approach. It describes the implementation of a case study conducted in franchised stores located in 
Thailand. The research methodology involves a meticulous examination of hourly product demand, prices that change 
depend on franchisor promotions., as well as a detailed analysis of the work processes and conditions in a 
representative single-worker case study shop, which handles multiple products and operates under cooking constraints. 
The study encompasses various aspects, such as pre-cooking product preparation, cooking durations, post-cooking 
procedures, product selling durations, monetary transactions, and ordering processes from the franchisor. Based on 
these findings, preparation and control policies are formulated for each product category. MS programs are employed 
to expedite processing and for design and testing purposes. The outcomes derived from this research hold potential 
for application in other branches, franchise stores, and various sales-oriented businesses. This study concludes with a 
summary of key findings and an outlook on prospects for research and development in this field.

1. Introduction
Planning the preparation of products for sale in a franchise food stall is an important part. To have products ready for 
sale and in sufficient quantity when there is a demand from customers who come to buy products at the store. Because 
there is high competition If preparing products for sale is not good enough There may be a situation where there is an 
overstock product left at the end of the day or there is a shortage of products during the day. This may result in 
opportunity costs, scrap product costs, and loss of trust with customers. Currently, franchise food stalls in the case 
study also face this problem. This is because operators only use experience to estimate the quantity of products sold. 
No data is collected. There is no plan for working. Only had been trained in the process of preparing products for 
cooking and selling. In this highly competitive economic environment, Store operators therefore need to adjust 
themselves to suit the situation for their stores to survive and increase their profits.  
The franchise store in the case study is a takeaway-type store. Products for sale can be divided into grilled, fried, and 
steamed. There are a variety of menus for customers to choose from and eat. This case study franchise has been famous 
in Thailand for more than 38 years. Currently, this franchise has more than 5000 branches in Thailand. One of the 
rules of this franchising is that if there is a finished good product left at the end of the day, it must be thrown away 
and cannot be reused after it has been cooked Thailand (2020). Work start time is 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM, with 1 employee

5. Conclusion  
This article presents the design and planning of product preparation for sale for a franchise food stall. By collecting 
data and various conditions to analyze and set policies to control the ordering of cooked products for sale, then use 
the policies in franchise food stalls, including designing programs with Microsoft Excel for operators to use, there is 
a notification at the Reorder point to cook products. All this design aims to increase efficiency in preparing products 
for sale. Reduce the number of out-of-stock products and the number of products remaining at the end of the day. The 
results from the actual implementation of the policy and program found that it was possible to increase efficiency in 
reducing the time needed to produce products for sale in the first period by having all products complete by 34.21 % 
from the order of product production. Establishing a policy for preparing products for sale can reduce the number of 
products remaining at the end of the day on average per day for all products. Reduce products out of stock during the 
day by an average of 100%. Reduce products out of stock at the end of the day by an average of 10 items per day. In 
addition, Able to reduce loss value compared to total profit by 22.84%.

Abstract 
The plastic sector in Peru has experienced significant growth, but SMEs face challenges such as high rates of 
defective products and low operational efficiency. Lean Manufacturing tools have been shown to improve 
productivity, but their combined application to reduce defects in SMEs in the plastic sector is limited. Challenges 
include inadequate machine maintenance and low calibration efficiency, leading to significant economic losses. 
This research proposes a model combining Lean tools like 5S, Poka Yoke, and Standardized Work with 
Autonomous and Preventive Maintenance from TPM to organize and optimize production processes. The results 
show a 2.68% reduction in defective products and a 4.77% increase in machine efficiency. Additionally, 5S audits 
improved by 41% and setup times were reduced by 26%. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed 
model in enhancing the competitiveness of SMEs in the plastic sector. Academically, this research provides a 
framework for future studies. Socioeconomically, the model can improve the competitiveness and sustainability 
of the plastic sector in Peru. It is recommended to explore new directions in the application of Lean Manufacturing 
and TPM in SMEs to maximize operational and economic benefits.

1. Introduction
Currently, the plastics sector is one of the most important economic activities in Peru and the world because, 
according to the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics, the plastics sector had a growth of 4.8% with 
respect to the level of purchases of durable consumer goods, which includes plastic manufacturing products with 
7.5% (INEI 2021). At the same time, around 2,425 companies belonging to the plastics sector were also registered, 
representing an increase of 31.5%. It should be noted that there are approximately 2,000 plastics companies in 
Metropolitan Lima. It is also estimated that the plastics sector generates more than 60,000 direct jobs per year. In 
2020, it was recorded that less than 3% of the companies in the plastics sector sold more than $50 million (INEI 
2021). According to the National Superintendence of Tax Administration, exports of plastic industry products 
totaled $555 million dollars. On the other hand, according to the SNI, the plastics sector brought as a benefit an 
increase of 3.5% of the industrial GDP (SNI 2021). 
For several years, companies in the plastics sector have been operating below the utilization rate, which represents 
71.5%. With this result, it is evident that the process must be improved using new work methodologies. Due to

The contributions of this study to the field of industrial engineering are manifold. Firstly, it provides empirical 
validation of the effectiveness of integrating Lean and TPM tools in an SME context, an area that has been 
underexplored in the existing literature. Secondly, it highlights improvements in key indicators such as the 
reduction of defective products, machine efficiency, and workplace organization. These findings offer a 
foundation for the application of these tools in other sectors and contexts, promoting a culture of continuous 
improvement and operational efficiency. 
 
In final observations, it is suggested that future studies delve deeper into exploring new combinations of Lean and 
TPM tools and their application in various industrial sectors. Additionally, it would be beneficial to investigate 
the impact of these tools on economic and environmental aspects, providing a more holistic view of their benefits. 
Training and employee engagement should also be areas of focus, as the effectiveness of these tools largely 
depends on active participation and commitment at all organizational levels. In conclusion, this research makes a 
significant contribution to the field of industrial engineering, providing a practical and validated model for 
improving production efficiency and quality in plastic sector SMEs and establishing a solid foundation for future 
research and practical applications.

Abstract 
The textile and garment sector in Peru is crucial to the economy, contributing to productive diversification and 
generating foreign exchange through exports. However, SMEs in this sector face significant operational challenges, 
including inefficient machine setup, high rates of rework, frequent breakdowns, and excessive sewing times due to 
lack of standardized processes. Addressing these issues is essential to enhance their competitiveness and sustainability. 
The proposed model integrates Lean Manufacturing and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) tools, such as 5S, 
Standardized Work, SMED, and Autonomous Maintenance, aiming to optimize production processes, reduce waste, 
and improve operational efficiency. This approach targeted deficiencies in machine setup, operational errors, and 
inadequate maintenance practices prevalent in the sector. The implementation of the model demonstrated significant 
improvements. Operational efficiency increased by 32.01%, defective product rates decreased by 29.81%, and setup 
times were reduced by 27.26%. These results were achieved through the systematic application of Lean and TPM 
principles, which streamlined processes, minimized downtime, and enhanced overall productivity. The research's 
impact extends beyond operational improvements, contributing to the academic literature by filling a knowledge gap 
in the application of Lean and TPM tools in textile SMEs. Socioeconomically, the model promotes job creation, 
preserves cultural traditions, and enhances the competitiveness of SMEs, fostering economic growth in the region. 
This study underscores the importance of adopting efficient production practices in the textile sector. It calls for further 
research to explore the integration of advanced technologies and methodologies to sustain and enhance these 
improvements. Scholars and practitioners are encouraged to build on these findings to drive innovation and growth in 
the industry.

1. Introduction
The importance of the SMEs in the textile and garment sector worldwide is undeniable, as these companies play a 
crucial role in the global economy by generating employment, driving innovation, and significantly contributing to 
international trade (DIVRIK & Baykal 2024). In Latin America, textile SMEs represent a fundamental part of the 
industry, serving as a driving force for economic and social development in the region (Ali 2022). In Peru, specifically, 
SMEs in the textile and garment sector are pillars of the economy, contributing to productive diversification and 
generating foreign exchange through their exports (Palacios-Mateo et al. 2021). These companies not only generate 
wealth but also preserve cultural traditions and foster creativity in garment design (Hrouga & Michel  2023). 
The production problems faced by SMEs in the textile and garment sector are related to deficiencies in machine setup 
when changing products, operational errors that generate rework, breakdowns due to poor maintenance, and excessive 
sewing times due to a lack of standardized work (Juanga-Labayen et al. 2022). These difficulties negatively impact

The analysis and implementation of the model resulted in a significant improvement in the efficiency of the sewing 
process. Work standardization not only reduced the preparation time from 12.00 to 8.00 minutes but also improved 
the quality of the work performed, decreasing handling errors and increasing operator productivity. This sequential 
and detailed approach allowed for a more streamlined and controlled process, reducing non-productive times and 
optimizing the use of available resources. Figure 7 shows that by eliminating certain activities, we eliminated the 
confection time from 9.30 minutes to 6.91 minutes (a reduction of approximately 26%).

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of this study revealed that the implementation of the proposed model based on Lean Manufacturing 
and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) resulted in a significant improvement in operational efficiency in the 
analyzed textile company. Productive efficiency increased from 64.27% to 84.84%, and the defective product rate 
decreased from 11.81% to 8.29%. Additionally, the average sewing cycle time decreased from 9.1 to 7.9 minutes, and 
machine setup time was reduced from 11.59 to 8.43 minutes. These results were validated through simulations and 
pilot tests, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in improving key performance indicators in textile production. 
The importance of this research lies in its ability to address and resolve critical issues in small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) in the textile sector, which is vital to the Peruvian economy. By improving productive efficiency 
and reducing defects in the production process, the research not only contributes to the sustainability and 
competitiveness of these companies but also promotes more efficient and sustainable production practices, benefiting 
both the industry and the local economy. 
 
Regarding contributions to the field of study, this work fills a gap in the literature on the application of Lean 
Manufacturing and TPM tools in textile SMEs. The integration of methodologies such as 5S, SMED, and Autonomous 
Maintenance not only optimizes production processes but also empowers workers through standardization and active 
participation in machine maintenance. This holistic and participatory approach has proven effective in improving the 
efficiency and quality of the production process, setting a precedent for future research in the sector. 
 
Final observations suggest that, although the proposed model has proven effective, additional studies are 
recommended to explore the integration of advanced technologies such as Industry 4.0 and artificial intelligence in 
textile production processes. These technologies have the potential to take optimization and efficiency to new levels, 
providing textile SMEs with even more powerful tools to compete in the global market. Additionally, continuous 
evaluation and periodic adjustments of the implemented model are suggested to adapt to market changes and the 
specific needs of each company. In conclusion, this research underscores the importance of adopting efficient and 
standardized production practices in the textile sector. It invites researchers and professionals to continue exploring 
and refining these methodologies, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and sustainability in the textile 
industry. The application of these approaches not only enhances productivity and quality but also contributes to the 
economic and social development of the communities where these companies operate.

Abstract 
The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector in the fashion industry, particularly in jeans manufacturing, is 
crucial globally, in Latin America, and specifically in Peru. However, it faces significant challenges such as excessive 
waste in the cutting phase, unproductive times during manufacturing, and low quality of subcontracted products, 
affecting operational efficiency and market competitiveness. To address these challenges, a production model based 
on Lean Manufacturing philosophy and Work Study was proposed, structured into four phases: organization of 
workstations using the 5S methodology, critical process analysis, production process control using poka-yoke, and 
consolidation of the production process. This model aimed to improve operational efficiency and product quality by 
standardizing processes and reducing errors and waste. The results showed an improvement in operational efficiency 
from 68% to 74%, a 177.08% increase in the 5S audit, and a 50% reduction in the occurrence of errors. Additionally, 
labor productivity increased from 4.6 to 5.2 units per PEN, representing a 13.04% improvement. These findings 
demonstrated the model's effectiveness in optimizing the jeans production process in SMEs. The academic and 
socioeconomic impact of this research is significant, as it provides a comprehensive framework for continuous 
improvement in jeans production, contributing to the sustainable and competitive development of the fashion sector 
in Peru. It also offers a solid foundation for future research on implementing Lean methodologies in other 
manufacturing contexts. It is imperative that researchers and professionals in industrial engineering explore new 
directions to further enhance operational efficiency and sustainability in jeans manufacturing. This study invites 
continued development and adaptation of Lean models to address the dynamic challenges of the industry.

Abstract 
Translational research focuses on bridging the gap between pure research and practical applications, often involving 
the development of prototypes for real-world use. In this paper, we use a systems engineering process including rapid 
prototyping, system architecture modeling, and user testing to translate research in optimization-based simulation of 
terminal airspace traffic from technology readiness level 3 (TRL 3) to TRL 6 (full-scale prototype demonstration). 
We deliver an analyst-ready tool for conducting design and evaluation studies in response to airspace restriction 
events. The paper provides a valuable framework for future translational research efforts in academic environments. 
Keywords 
Translational research, system architecture modeling, airspace design, optimization applications 
Introduction  
The terminal maneuvering area around an airport is typically defined in terms of Standard Instrument Departure (SID) 
and Standard Instrument Arrival (STAR) routes which connect the airport to the en-route airspace. The high-level 
problem statement for this research is on how to re-design the terminal airspace for an airport and evaluate the 
performance of that design if a portion of the airspace becomes unavailable for some reason. This may happen due to 
weather systems, or forest fire plumes. Alternatively, even with the full airspace available, traffic volumes may 
increase to the point of requiring additional or modified routes (SIDs and STARs) to cope with the volume. The 
importance of this work is two-fold: we provide an analyst-ready tool for conducting such studies and we establish 
valuable patterns for conducting translational research in academic environments. 
Objectives 
The objective of this translational research was to take a research concept in airspace design evaluation from 
technology readiness level 3 (“validate critical properties and predictions using non-integrated software components”) 
to level 6 (“Prototype implementations of the software demonstrated on full-scale realistic problems”) (NASA 2017). 
Our vision was to provide an analyst-ready integrated tool to support the re-design of terminal airspaces by following 
a structured systems engineering approach. 
2. Literature Review
Validating an airspace design typically requires a high-fidelity simulation of the design with representative flight 
schedules, physics-based aircraft trajectories, accurate arrival and departure sequencing, and mimicking of controller 
decisions to set approach speeds, vector aircraft, or to place aircraft into holding patterns. Commercial software such 
as AirTOP (AirTOP 2024) is specialized to support the development of such high-fidelity simulations. The challenge 
is that such development can take weeks of an analyst’s time (Odoni et al. 1997). Another approach is to use 
optimization-based simulation which can quickly evaluate an airspace design. These approaches are often referred to

6. Conclusion 
This paper documents the successful translation of a sophisticated algorithm for the estimation of delays in terminal 
maneuvering areas into an analyst-friendly tool for evaluation of alternative airspace designs. The use of system 
engineering techniques such as rapid prototyping, system architecture modeling, and user testing contributed to the 
success of the implementation. The online system architecture document is useful for case studies in systems 
engineering: it features the progression of analysis for this tool from Operational Analysis, through System Analysis, 
to Logical Architecture and includes database design as well.

Abstract 
The quality of an assembled product and cycle time are significantly influenced by a workstation's ergonomics. A 
study was carried out to investigate how the cycle time and assembly quality were affected by minor workstation 
modifications that could potentially reduce the ergonomic strain. For the investigation, a single workstation from the 
main assembly line—which assembled eight components and was the cause of 43% of quality defects—was chosen.  
In an experimental design, the standing surface surrounding the workstation, the assembly height, and the reachability 
of components were all changed. Many times, complaints or injuries serve as the impetus for ergonomic solutions. 
This study measured the effects of implementing suggested ergonomic conditions using profit-focused measures to 
promote proactive action. The findings show that workstation setups varied significantly in terms of cycle time and 
product quality. The components' reachability showed a notable reduction in cycle time. The standing surface of the 
workstation and the reachability of the components led to a markedly reduced assembly quality. There was no 
difference between the current conditions and assembly taking place at the recommended height.

1.Introduction
The study of ergonomics focuses on matching an employee's surroundings and job needs to improve productivity, 
quality, and output while reducing fatigue, overexertion, and musculoskeletal problems associated with the workplace 
(Edwards C. 2023). The study of ergonomics reviews the posture and movements of a person to find potentially 
dangerous or unfavorable conditions. This includes but is not limited to, curvature of the spine, angles of joints, 
rotation of limbs, forces, action frequency, noise, vibration, and lighting (Rexroth 2012). In assembly, an employee is 
expected to complete sequential tasks where staged parts are placed together to construct another product or 
component. This process could include pushing or pulling parts together, lifting objects, and accurately placing or 
rotating objects. This process could be repeated thousands of times throughout the tenure of an employee.  
The characteristics of an assembly workstation drive the ergonomic load placed on the user. Characteristics such as 
the size and height of the table, the locations of the tools and parts they are using, and actions required to assemble, 
and drive the angles, forces, and postures the user endures. In addition to the physical characteristics, ambient 
conditions, like temperature and volume, impact the worker and the load placed on them. Ergonomics is important in 
the workplace as employees can be faced with the conditions of an environment for an entire career. Poor ergonomics 
can lead to an extensive list of injuries or conditions, especially in extended periods. 
Reducing joint angles, improving posture, decreasing lift requirements, or any other improvement to the ergonomics 
of a workstation is known to make for safer working conditions. These changes reduce the risk of musculoskeletal

need to be lifted higher. Lastly, the addition of the antifatigue mat without a corresponding change in the reach points 
would further increase the reach required.  
 
Conditions expected to produce the shortest cycle time are: 41-inch assembly height, components located 16 inches 
diagonally from the assembly, and standing on steel grates. The combination of the lower assembly height and 
recommended position of components increases the density of the reach points. These points include tools as the 
distance from the table surface to the assembly height is reduced. In addition to reduced reach requirements of the 
workstation, assembly occurring in a more ergonomically efficient region might assist in cycle time reduction. Using 
the regression equation, the expected cycle time of this condition would be 47.75 seconds, 3.85 seconds shorter than 
the expected worst case, 51.6 seconds.  
 
Assembly Hysteresis 
The factorial plot, visualizing the effects of the three factors on hysteresis, shows a large difference in effects from 
reachability and standing surface, while assembly height change shows very little effect. Using this plot, the 
combination of workstation characteristics that is expected to result in the most hysteresis in a shock is: 41-inch 
assembly height, components located 16 inches diagonally from the assembly, with an antifatigue mat. Each of these 
conditions are recommended for their ergonomic benefits, none of which are used in normal production at the 
manufacturer. Considering these conditions in the regression equation, hysteresis is expected to be 0.965 pounds.  
The combination expected to produce the least amount of hysteresis is: 50-inch assembly height, components located 
on the table surface, and standing on the steel grates, all conditions practiced during the manufacturers normal 
production. These two sets of conditions show that seal installation is more efficient in the conditions practiced during 
normal production. Hysteresis is expected to be reduced 0.304 pounds, down to 0.661 pounds, from the worst to best 
conditions. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study examined the effects of simple workstation changes, potentially reducing the ergonomic load, on the cycle 
time and quality of the assembly. The study was conducted at an automotive shock absorber manufacturer in Lakeville 
Minnesota. A single workstation of the main assembly line, responsible for assembling eight components and the 
source of 43% of quality defects, was selected for the study. Through two replications of four different experiments, 
assembly height, reachability of components, and the standing surface around the workstation were controlled. Each 
of the three factors had two levels, the lower being the current configuration during normal production, and the higher 
being a condition recommended for its ergonomic qualities. 
 
Ergonomic interventions are often motivated by complaints or injuries. To encourage proactive intervention, this study 
used profit focused metrics to measure the impacts of implementing recommended ergonomic conditions. The results 
demonstrate a significant difference between workstation configurations for both cycle time and product quality. 
Reachability of components demonstrated a significant improvement in cycle time. Workstation standing surface and 
component reachability resulted in significantly lower assembly quality. Assembly occurring at the recommended 
height was no different than the current conditions.  
 
Using results from the regression equations developed during analysis, optimal conditions considering both measures 
were determined. Recommended conditions of a 41-inch assembly height and components 16 inches from the 
assembly are expected to provide the best quality and cycle time results without the use of the recommended 
antifatigue mat. The two recommended conditions were not practiced during normal production at this manufacturer. 
This demonstrates how ergonomic intervention can positively influence the quality and cycle time of assembly.

Abstract 
This research presents an in-depth examination of a Six Sigma project undertaken at The Marwin Company, which 
aims to improve the manufacturing process of Knee Wall Doors — specifically, reducing the defective units and the 
reprocessing time. The project is based on the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) approach and 
utilizes various tools from the Six Sigma methodology, such as Statistical Process Control (SPC), control charts, and 
Design of Experiments (DOE). After an objective evaluation, we define a possible root cause and propose 
improvements based on the data collection and statistical analysis results. This study's results allowed a better 
understanding of which factors can affect the quality of the product and what decisions can be taken to control it. This 
research concludes that temperature when gluing and pressing is a significant factor in the process. The higher the 
temperature, the more viscous the glue will be, resulting in a more significant amount of adhesive flowing out to the 
edges when the door enters the pressing machine, which reduces the amount of glue in contact with both surfaces. 
Hence, the time factor can be adjusted based on the temperature to get better bondage between materials.

Introduction 
Knee Wall Door's assembly process happens in two different areas. The project intends to address where the door is 
built, glued, pressed, and cured. The other area is a CNC machine, which cuts or removes the material to form the 
knob and hinges sections (figure 1). Finally, the door is assembled with the jamb. Building and gluing processes 
involve the utilization of Medium Density Fiber rails (MDF), two hardboard panels, and an insulation core, as depicted 
in Figure 2. Glue must be applied evenly across rails to create a strong joint between rails and MDF panels. It is crucial 
to complete the gluing and assembly process as quickly as possible to prevent the glue from setting prematurely.  
The Marwin Company, which produces Knee Wall Doors, has experienced a surge in defective units, resulting in a 
significant waste of materials and time. The assembly process of a door is a continuous, single-operator procedure that 
involves several steps: 
1.
The operator applies adhesive to the edges of the hardboard using a dedicated gluing table. This step takes
approximately 10-15 seconds to complete.
2.
The operator assembles the glued hardboard sheets with MDF rails using a specially designed fixture to ensure 
precise 90-degree angles between the rails, as shown in Figure 3.
3.
Each door is secured with an elastic strap that pulls the assembly towards one corner. Those straps guarantee
squareness.
4.
After stacking four doors with interleaved slip sheets and a protective cap on top, the operator introduces the
loaded fixture plate into a specialized pressing machine (Figure 4).
5.
The pressure forces air and glue outwards, spreads the glue into a thin film of uniform thickness, forces the
glue into the material interstices, holds the joint in the correct position while the glue sets, and prevents
warping.
6.
The operator starts a timer, which is set up to 20 minutes. Then, the loaded fixture plate is pulled away.

Abstract 
This study investigates the impact of resource orchestration, innovation, and diversification on firm performance. 
Resource orchestration theory highlights the role of managerial actions in acquiring, exploiting, and leveraging firms’ 
resources to overcome a critical situation, seize business opportunities, and thrive in the post-crisis landscape. The 
conceptualization is to understand how firms can leverage their resources effectively, invest in innovation, and 
diversify their operations to achieve superior performance following a crisis. The methodology involves a mixed-
method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative research. The qualitative research employs in-depth 
interviews with seven business owners, and the findings are content analyzed to capture emerging themes regarding 
firms’ strategies post-COVID-19 crisis: resource orchestration, innovation, business diversification, and firm 
performance. Based on these themes, this study develops a theoretical framework and tests it using a survey of 350 
small- and medium-sized enterprises in Indonesia. The data are analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). 
The qualitative aspect provides insights into how firms navigate the business post-crisis, while the quantitative surveys 
offer a broader perspective on the strategies adopted. The results reveal that resource orchestration significantly 
influences firms’ innovation and diversification. No significant evidence is found on the direct relationship between 
diversification and firm performance; however, innovation, in turn, improves diversification and firm performance. 
By synthesizing this comprehensive approach and findings, this study enhances the understanding of how firms 
strategically leverage their resources, innovate, and diversify their business to thrive in the post-crisis environment. 
This study further brings practical insights into how firms navigate in the aftermath and provides a roadmap to foster 
business sustainability.

Abstract 
Like some other cities in Japan, Kiryu City faces challenges such as an aging population and over-reliance on 
automobiles, making the development of new transportation methods an urgent necessity. Therefore, efforts focused 
on multi-mobility optimization utilizing autonomous vehicle technologies have gained attention. One of the main 
challenges Kiryu City faces is the increased risk associated with elderly drivers. Additionally, the excessive 
dependency on private vehicles throughout Gunma Prefecture is a significant problem. Furthermore, securing 
transportation for elderly individuals who have surrendered their driver's licenses and the weakening of public 
transportation due to population decline are serious concerns. Hence, there is a demand for new mobility services that 
combine safety, reduced environmental impact, and convenience by solving these problems. Therefore, this research 
aims to construct effective mobility services using autonomous vehicle technologies. We are developing a smart 
satellite city simulator as part of this initiative. Using this simulator, we conduct simulation analysis and optimization 
of mobility services, employing Kiryu City as a model case. Specifically, it employs various autonomous mobility 
options to meet citizens' transportation needs while optimizing multiple objectives such as revenue, operational costs, 
and user satisfaction. Through these efforts, we examine business models and strategies for implementation after the 
technology is completed to realize a sustainable urban transportation system.

Abstract 
The ever-growing link between food waste and climate change has led the European Commission (EC) to introduce 
the Industry 5.0 framework, aiming to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by fostering sustainable, 
human-centric, and resilient systems. Along these lines, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered a blueprint for this 
change, with great potential for the agri-food industry. To accelerate the shift towards Industry 5.0, an Edge-AI system 
is proposed. This system captures timely data through visual recognition of the On-Shelf Availability (OSA) index at 
supermarket shelves, monitoring which products are in high or low demand for efficient distribution. For this purpose, 
a bi-objective model is designed to: 1) identify the type of agri-food shelf detected, and 2) determine whether the OSA 
is fully stocked. An original dataset was compiled, comprising up to 16,000 imagery samples for these objectives. For 
the first one, Deep Learning (DL) was employed through a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 
reasonable computation time, achieving a testing accuracy of up to 99.78% in identifying eight products. Transfer 
Learning (TL) using the Residual Network (ResNet) yielded a testing accuracy of up to 98.76% for OSA detection. 
To blur the lines among different Agri-Food Supply Chain (AFSC) facilitators, a web platform will be developed to 
represent this real-time information intuitively. This platform will serve as an interactive decision-making tool to 
simulate “what if” scenarios. From a holistic standpoint, this approach contributes to building an equitable food 
security construct while upholding environmental responsibility to meet Industry 5.0 pillars.

1. Introduction
Almost a decade has passed since the inception of Industry 4.0 in Germany in 2011, and the controversies surrounding 
it have yet to begin (Xu et al.  2021). Certainly, it has proven central to many successes across the industrial dimension. 
Yet, the EC speculates whether its profit-centric and operationally-oriented nature can address current social and 
environmental issues. In the immediate past, the dynamics of supply chains were disrupted during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Its impact exceeded that; it revealed their vulnerability in maintaining societal and environmental 
stewardship. As a result, the model of Industry 5.0 was brought to light, emphasizing the role of technology amidst

3.) Variety in Dataset:  
The current dataset contains direct line-of-sight images. To enhance the performance of this system under different 
scenarios, considering obstructions from employees or customers could be added, thereby simulating realistic retailing 
environments. 
 
6. Conclusion  
To conclude, this research aims to accelerate progress toward Industry 5.0 by elucidating its role in promoting 
environmental and societal stewardship. To achieve this, an Edge-AI system was proposed to enhance operational 
efficiency, contributing to food security and environmental responsibility. As a result, this ongoing project contributes 
to the literature by establishing a smart system to determine OSA in agri-food retailing, facilitating intuitive planning. 
An original dataset, comprising up to 16,000 imagery samples from various agri-food retailers, was compiled for these 
objectives. For agri-food classification, DL using a custom CNN with low computational complexity achieved a 
testing accuracy of up to 99.78% in identifying eight products. For OSA detection, TL using the ResNet50 architecture 
yielded a testing accuracy of up to 98.76% with a quick computation time.  
 
Despite these promising outcomes, this system still has several limitations. The current ResNet50 has not been 
evaluated against other architectures regarding computational efficacy and overall performance. Additionally, real-
time testing of the custom CNN and ResNet50 models for simultaneous classification and OSA detection remains a 
critical evaluation once the prototype is fully developed. Moreover, the dataset lacks diversity in terms of obstructions, 
which may limit its adoption in retailing environments. Future work will focus on improving these aspects, in addition 
to building a unified web platform to integrate insights from the Edge-AI system. Through this interactive decision-
making tool, AFSC operators will be able to simulate various “what if” scenarios and optimize their operations 
accordingly, in alignment with Industry 5.0 vision.

Abstract 
In recent years, automated driving technology has improved, and in some regions in Japan, automated vehicles (AVs) 
are being operated to serve the public. However, unlike other countries, Japan has many railway-level crossings in 
both urban and rural areas, which poses an additional concern for safe AV operation as there are reported failing cases 
of gate non-closure during train crossings. Therefore, AVs need a system to pass through safely, ensuring no train is 
approaching even when the gate is open due to malfunctioning the sensing and operating systems. Furthermore, a 
level crossing often causes traffic bottlenecks since each vehicle must manually ensure safety as per mandatory traffic 
rules in Japan. This research investigates and summarizes various aspects of traffic flows at an existing railway-level 
crossing in Kiryu City, Japan, and proposes a safety-ensuring mechanism to enhance the traffic flows and alleviate 
congestion. Specifically, a camera-based online image processing mechanism for AVs is developed to detect the 
presence of any approaching or passing rail while driving at a low speed. If safety is ensured, an AV can pass the level 
crossing swiftly without a complete stop. Based on such an advanced safety ensuring system, we have shown that 
traffic flows on the model level-crossing at Kiryu are significantly improved, besides reducing fuel consumption, 
emissions, and vehicle idling time.

Abstract 
This paper aims to discuss the developments of different cost models and their use in manufacturing firms. It starts 
by presenting the historical background of cost accounting, from the basic process of allocating direct costs to 
more modified models used in the current manufacture. The paper also focuses on tables and models. It analyzes 
the main cost models, which cover Activity-based Costing, Standard Costing, Job Order Costing, Process Costing, 
Lean Accounting, Target Costing, and Marginal Costing. Every identified model is discussed in detail, and the 
emphasis is placed on its general principles, methodologies, and practical use. In addition, the paper described the 
implementation of artificial intelligence in cost modeling to advance the chances of accuracy, efficiency, and 
adequate decision-making in manufacturing. In this regard, the paper compares the strengths and weaknesses of 
each model and assists manufacturers in choosing the right approach. The research also assesses the new trend in 
cost modeling, which includes artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and cloud solutions as major 
developmental trends for cost management in the manufacturing industry. The present paper outlines the main 
issues and drawbacks of current cost models. It might be useful for orientation for manufacturers who strive to 
enhance their cost management and remain competitive in the climate of constant change in industrial relations.

Introduction 
Evaluations regarding the cost have been pursued central to the industry of manufacturing, all over the progression 
in the need of the business. Originally, cost accounting could be done with basic methodologies and more involved 
procedures to document the costs; however, the costing methods have become necessary to adapt to more complex 
manufacturing processes. In the early forms of cost estimations, organizations concentrated mainly on tangible 
costs, including the cost of the materials used in the process and the cost of salaries for the workers involved in 
the process (Anggraeni et al. 2019). Nevertheless, after the Industrial Revolution and in specific mass production 
by the manufacturers, the addition of indirect costs and overheads became inevitable. This need to pave the way 
for more advanced models such as Activity Costing (ABC) and Standard Costing, which provided a more 
extensive look at how costs were incurred and distributed in several manufacturing activities (Kenton 2023). 
The objective of this research is to identify various cost models prevalent in the manufacturing segment and 
provide an explanation of their usage. By analyzing these models, manufacturers become aware of the 
opportunities to minimize the costs of production and maximize the rate of profitability. This study intends to give 
a competent analysis of the main cost models, which include ABC, Standard, Job Order, Process, Lean, Target, 
and Marginal Costing. In reviewing these models, each model’s cardinal principles, methodologies, and examples 
of use to enhance cost management in manufacturing will be considered to achieve that understanding. This work 
will also compare the models, review their applications, and analyze case studies and practical examples to 
demonstrate the efficiency of each model with respect to the manufacturing context. Therefore, cost models are 
instrumental in achieving cost control over resources and improving the profitability of manufacturing firms. 
Thus, with the help of the proper cost model’s application, manufacturers can enhance their productivity with 
minimal waste and increase their competitiveness. This study aims to provide manufacturing professionals with 
the knowledge they need to choose and apply the cost models that work best for their particular requirements.

Changing Market Conditions 
Some of the factors that influence costs include raw material price, exchange rates, and the price of labor, and 
these factors change within a short period of time, hence leading to the obsolescence of the cost models. 
Manufacturers need to update their models periodically to conform to the changes. 
 
Complexity 
It should also be noted that some of the cost models, such as ABC, can be quite tough to incorporate and even 
sustain. Their collection and analysis involve massive efforts, costs, as well as the necessity of qualified staff. It 
may be difficult for small manufacturers to come up with a complex cost model, mainly because of a lack of 
capital. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper advanced a discursive understanding of different cost models in manufacturing, the development of 
concepts, theories, and current trends. Activity-Based Costing is advantageous when there are several activity 
centers and numerous cost drivers, Standard Costing is beneficial when there is minimal fluctuation in the market 
price of products. Job Order Costing is appropriate where production is based on orders received, Process Costing 
is right where production is in batches, Lean Accounting lets the cost of overheads be determined at a central 
point; while Target Costing’s strength is that it is flexible and covers a broad The ultimate process of cost control 
is essential in achieving high standards and production costs, as well as an increase in profitability. It has to be 
noted that manufacturers should pay special attention to their particular needs while defining the kind of cost 
model to use given their operating environments. The effectiveness of using real-time information and advanced 
technologies may improve cost precision and decision-making even further. As a result, it is crucial to include AI 
and IoT as more technologies with which cost models ought to be more accurate and dynamically integrated into 
future studies. Furthermore, understanding the effects of these innovations on various manufacturing contexts can 
be informative for the systems’ further enhancement of cost management.

Abstract 
This article aims at reviewing the advancement of smart manufacturing, also referred to as, Industry 4.0., as an index among 
the global industrial players. This paper explores a literature review of recent trends in smart manufacturing, the use of smart 
manufacturing technologies, and their impact on using the Creativity Index to measure productivity, quality nowadays, and the 
environmental impact of different industries' adoption. This, therefore, means that besides large manufacturers that are currently 
more inclined to the concept of smart manufacturing, small and medium enterprises are gradually beginning to realize the 
importance of its application. The use of IIoT, Big Data Analytics, AI, and DT has brought about changes that have been 
rewarding regarding productivity, which has improved by 15–20% and the defect rate has been cut by approximately 50%. 
However, some disadvantages are still being experienced; higher initial capital investment, lack of proper skills among 
employees, and last but not least, security threats. The study focuses on aspects of proper implementation of strategies like pilot 
testing and gradual rollout and examines success ratios. Linear regression for predictive modeling and K-means clustering for 
anomaly detection are the two mathematical models that are explained with the help of making the readers familiar with the 
actual implementation in smart manufacturing. The paper also responds to the question of ethics and society, which refers to 
workforce dynamics and digital divide issues in this new industrial revolution. Therefore, this study contributes to the 
knowledge of the area of smart manufacturing by presenting a comprehensive vision of the subject that incorporates the 
technology itself, the application methods, and the effects of smart manufacturing on society to lay the foundation for future 
research and business uses.

1.Introduction
Smart manufacturing also referred to as Industry 4.0, is characterized by sustainable innovation and the extensive use of digital 
technology to design supremely adaptable and integrated industrial systems (IBM 2021). Smart manufacturing conceptualizes 
cyber-physical systems, IoT, and cloud computing together with artificial intelligence to convert conventional manufacturing 
into smart and self-optimizing systems. The major concepts of smart manufacturing include the use of real-time data 
acquisition, the decision-making process, the integration of systems and processes, and the flexibility to respond to market 
needs. They include; enhancing production speed, improving the quality of the product, minimizing waste and downtime, and 
most importantly, improving the organization’s performance (Bimpas et al. 2024). Thus, it is possible to embrace smart 
manufacturing as one of the fundamental concepts in the rapidly changing industrial environment of today. Globalization and 
competition have been on the rise and customer requirements are ever higher, which creates more pressure on manufacturers 
to constantly improve innovativeness, minimize costs, and bring in products that are of high quality in shorter periods (Faster 
Capital 2024). Smart manufacturing presents itself as a solution to these challenges, being the key to revolutionizing industrial 
processes; as well as reconstructing global competitive playing fields. Smart manufacturing techniques incorporate the use of 
data, including big data and data analytics, in a way that optimizes value; this includes predictive maintenance, a concept that 
reduces potential downtime in valuable production equipment (Moyne and Iskandar  2017).

Randomly select two centroids 
For each point, calculate the distance to the closest centroid 
Therefore, new points for centroids should be assigned with a view of recalculating the centroids. 
The process of iterations should be continued till the solution is optimized, or, in other words, is said to be convergent. 
After convergence, we might end up with two clusters: 
Cluster 1 centroid: (71.5 per cent, 102.5 per cent) 
Cluster 2 centroid: Annotation: (85, 120). 
Point (85, 120) is designated as a suspicious point, which could correspond to machinery functioning beyond standard values. 
Such early detection could eliminate some equipment failures and, therefore, keep the relevant costs in check. 
 
These real-life cases highlight how the different smart manufacturing technologies can boost efficiency and quality, thus cutting 
costs. On the ethical and social side, there are issues concerning employment opportunity, data privacy, and the emergence of 
a digital gap between large manufacturing firms and SMEs. As it can positively influence manufacturing sustainability on the 
material flow side, it also presents a new set of risks associated with cyber security and elevated rates of digital technology 
utilization affecting the environment. Finally, it is necessary to emphasize that smart manufacturing is highly effective in terms 
of productivity, quality, and sustainability; however, the transition to smart manufacturing technologies should be performed 
carefully, taking into consideration the technological aspect of the current industrial revolution along with the social one. 
6. Conclusions and Future Research Directions 
              This thorough analysis of smart manufacturing has shown how Industry 4.0 technologies can completely revolutionize 
manufacturing processes. Smart Manufacturing adoption offers a great impact since it influences positive changes such as 
boosting productivity, high quality, and sustainability. But it also tells a lot about the drawbacks of manufacturing, including 
the high initial cost, lack of skilled workers, and cybersecurity risks. Thus, the study enriches the issue map by presenting a 
comprehensive overview of Smart Manufacturing technologies, strategies for their adoption, and outcomes. They enhance 
one’s understanding of how different technologies and interventions work and the ethical/societal impact of this industrial 
revolution Therefore, based on the research results, we recommend manufacturers implement smart manufacturing step by 
step, with a focus on pilot implementations of the technologies. To this end, increasing attention should be paid to the 
development of human capital as well as cybersecurity, alongside the phenomenon of digital transformation. Policymakers 
must work on shaping enabling environments that would encourage the embeddedness of smart manufacturing technologies 
among SMEs, with equal consideration given to the probable displacement of the workforce, by developing effective reskilling 
strategies. Further research can be directed at the consequences of smart manufacturing for supply chains at the international 
level and the labor market. Quantum computing and 5G are some of the possible working environments that require further 
investigation on how they can be integrated into the manufacturing fields. Moreover, further studies of specific areas of smart 
manufacturing, as well as the effects, that they have on the environment, would be useful. Thus, the study of how large firms 
and SMEs can overcome the digital gap by adopting smart manufacturing forms the last intriguing area of research.

Abstract 
The warehouse's facility layout arrangement can positively impact the company's performance, as indicated by the 
efficiency of material handling activities. On the other hand, a bad layout implies that the material flow is hampered, 
thus reducing performance. Therefore, analyzing and improving the facility's layout is important to produce effective 
and efficient operational activities. Company XYZ, which is engaged in processing refined sugar, needs help with the 
layout of its warehouse area, which impacts the inefficiency of warehousing activities. Accordingly, this research used 
the dedicated storage method to propose a warehouse layout through two scenarios. This research found that the 
proposed layout design for scenario 1 decreased travel distance by 41.497%. Meanwhile, scenario 2 reduced travel 
distance by 21.484% compared to the existing layout.

Introduction 
An efficient company facility layout positively impacts the company by minimizing costs, increasing production speed 
and accuracy, and reducing employee movement to save time and minimize fatigue (Albert et al. 2023). On the 
contrary, a poor layout harms the company because it causes obstruction of material flow, excessive employee 
movement, and high production costs, resulting in a decrease in the company's performance (Yener and Yazgan 2019). 
Therefore, an analysis of the company's facility layout needs to be carried out to find out what company facilities need 
to be evaluated and improved to minimize or even avoid negative impacts that will occur (Shah and Khanzode 2017). 
Contextually, Company XYZ is a manufacturing industry company engaged in processing to produce refined sugar. 
Based on the results of observations, it is known that the warehouse area (spare parts and sacks) at Company XYZ 
still has problems, namely First, the placement of product-type shelves that have not been arranged properly and have

Referring to Table 9, the rule difference between the two scenarios is in the fourth rule, where scenario 1 does not use 
a buffer, whereas scenario 2 places a buffer. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the data processing conducted, this study found that the proposed layout design for scenario 1 has a total 
travel distance in and out of 66,466.12 cm with shelves arranged differently from the existing layout, namely 
vertically; it can have a significant effect on warehouse performance, which is 47,139.06 cm for the difference with 
the existing layout and produces a percentage reduction in travel distance of 41.497%. The proposed layout design 
based on scenario 2 has a total travel distance of 89,198.16 cm and makes a percentage reduction in travel distance of 
21.484% compared to the existing layout. Furthermore, this study has the opportunity for further research development 
by investigating from the investment aspect or benefit-cost analysis.

Abstract 
Challenges and uncertainties resulting from the volatile global market environment require organisations to operate 
efficiently, hold onto their market share and increase product value to stay competitive. Achievement of these goals 
depends on a number of factors. One of the routes that are pivotal to a positive contribution is the effective 
implementation of quality management practice (QMP). The lack of guidance in this area can be an issue, especially 
for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Understanding the key success factor will establish a suitable direction 
that organisations can use. This paper will conduct an in-depth case study, investigating the way QMP is executed in 
a Malaysian manufacturing SME. Through the use of interviews, it is suggested the shop floor worker’s level of 
education and the complexity of product assembly are the deciding factors in introducing the types of QMP. Also the 
adoption of ‘gemba’ principles helps to facilitate the introduction of QMP. Practically, the findings from this paper 
reemphasise the need to look at human resource capability in introducing QMP. As a result, a plan for QMP integration 
could be prepared by management to improve the way change is introduced in manufacturing SMEs.

Abstract 
Merchants get advantages from mobile payments through heightened sales, expedited transactions, and less 
dependence on physical cash management. In rural petrol stations, previous studies show less consideration among 
merchants for adopting m-payment. This is due to a few factors like infrastructure requirements, accessibility via basic 
smartphones, and government initiatives promoting digital financial services that contribute to widespread acceptance 
in rural areas.  This study contributes to rural mobile payment literature, particularly in the petrol station sector, aiming 
to guide policymakers, industry stakeholders, and service providers. It seeks to identify crucial elements, emphasize 
the significance of cost and security, and offer recommendations for the effective integration of mobile payment 
systems among rural petrol station merchants in Northern Malaysia.

Abstract 
This paper explores the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) as an engaging educational tool to enhance the awareness 
of dengue fever among primary school children in Kuala Lumpur. Motivated by the alarming rise in dengue cases in 
the region, the study emphasizes the importance of beginning awareness efforts with young children. An AR-based 
educational tool was proposed due to its interactive and appealing nature, which is particularly effective for young 
learners. A quantitative methodology was employed, dividing the study into two sections: an entry survey and an exit 
survey. The entry survey assessed the children's initial awareness of AR technology and dengue fever. The study 
involved eighty primary school children aged seven to twelve, who were introduced to an AR-based activity book 
designed to be a visually engaging instructional resource about dengue fever. The exit survey evaluated improvements 
in the children's awareness of both AR technology and dengue fever after using the AR-based activity book. The 
findings indicate a significant improvement in awareness of both AR and dengue fever among the children, 
demonstrating AR's effectiveness as an educational tool for primary school students. This study highlights the potential 
of AR technology to enhance public health education and proposes a viable method for future dengue awareness 
initiatives.

Abstract 
Increasing productivity is crucial for businesses to sustain their performance and efficiency in an increasingly 
competitive industrial environment. This study focuses on enhancing the productivity of the cement production 
process at PT XYZ, one of Indonesia's largest cement manufacturers, using the Objective Matrix (OMAX) method. 
Data was collected from the company’s historical production records in 2023 which encompass actual production 
outputs, machine downtime, working hours, raw material, and energy consumption. Four critical performance criteria 
were identified: machine efficiency, energy consumption efficiency, raw material usage efficiency, and machine 
effectiveness. We found that the company's productivity index fluctuated frequently, and poor productivity was 
identified for several months. Analysis of the company's productivity index shows that the highest increase occurred 
in August, which increased by 144% from July, and the highest decrease occurred in February, which decreased by 
58% from January. Key findings indicate that machine-related factors significantly influence production productivity, 
which leads to recommendations for a predictive maintenance strategy to replace the current preventive maintenance 
approach.

Introduction  
Along with technological developments, competition in the industrial world is becoming increasingly fierce. High 
competition between industries puts tremendous pressure on companies to improve their performance and efficiency 
to maintain their position. In maintaining its position, various factors can influence a company's position in the 
industrial competition, including productivity (Prayoga and Suseno 2023). In light of market dynamics, the study of 
productivity improvement is becoming more important since it allows the company to maintain their competitiveness 
and strengthens the social component of societal growth (Mhlanga and Pradhan 2020). Measuring the productivity of

Abstract 
Sport Glove Indonesia is a glove manufacturing company chosen for the study case in the implementation of lean 
manufacturing approach. The aim is to increase Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE) by reducing waste. This research 
focuses on epic cutter style gloves which have a fairly large production percentage in January 2024. Value Stream 
Mapping (VSM), Fishbone Diagram and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) were used to identify waste and 
prepare recommendations for appropriate improvement proposals to overcome the problem. The results of the VSM 
analysis show that embellishment and final inspection as well as the sewing department are needed to be evaluated. 
Apart from that, it is known that the most dominant waste that occurs and has the greatest potential to hinder the 
production process is defects with a percentage of 23.13%. According to the RPN value from FMEA analysis, it shows 
that the root causes are operators who are not focused, as well as machines that often experience problems and tools 
that are worn out. Then, improvement proposals are designed to reduce and eliminate waste. According to the analysis, 
after some improvements have been made the PCE value increased by 3.91%, from 46.94% to 50.84%.

1. Introduction
Sport Glove Indonesia is a company engaged in glove manufacturing which is located in Krandon, Sleman, 
Yogyakarta. PT. SGI focuses on supplying gloves to overseas customers. PT. SGI continuously strives to produce 
quality products and strives to meet customer needs. However, in implementing the production process, there are still 
several obstacles so that the production process is hampered and the daily production target is not achieved. The 
product that is the focus of this research is epic cutter style gloves, which are the newest style and have a fairly large 
production percentage in January 2024 and are products with high defects. Apart from that, several wastes were found 
on the production floor such as defects, waiting time, and buildup. One approach that can be applied to reduce waste 
and increase efficiency is using the Lean Manufacturing concept. Lean Manufacturing is an approach carried out with 
the aim of creating value for customers by reducing activities that do not add value (non-value-added activities) or 
waste and focusing on processes that provide added value (value-added activities) so as to increase the efficiency 
cycle in the production process(Womack & Jones 1991). The Value Stream Mapping (VSM) tool is used to describe 
the overall state of the production process by paying attention to information flow and physical flow (Alfiansyah & 
Kurniati 2018). To identify the most dominant type of waste on the production floor, the Waste Assessment Model

6. Conclusion 
To produce one type of epic cutter glove requires a total production lead time of 1011.24 seconds, which consists of 
value added activity of 777.11 seconds, necessary but non-value added activity of 99 seconds and non-value added 
activity of 99 seconds. added activity of 135.13 seconds. The most dominant waste that occurs and has the greatest 
potential to hamper the production process is defect waste with a percentage of 23.13%. From the results of the analysis 
of the causes of defects using FMEA, it is known that the causes with the highest RPN values are operators who are 
not focused, as well as machines that often experience problems and tools that are worn out. Then proposals for 
improvements are prepared to reduce and eliminate waste. If the proposed improvements can be implemented well, it 
can reduce the Production Lead Time to 1511.94 seconds and PCE value increased by 3.91% from 46.94% to 50.84%. 
By increasing PCE, production output can be achieved because the production cycle time is directly proportional to 
the product produced.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to significantly reduce the lack of liquidity of small and medium-sized enterprises in 
Mexico City, by reducing credit risk management through a model based on Machine Learning to establish credit 
policies based on their characteristics, behavioral patterns, and payment capacity of customers without compromising 
the financial situation of the business. For the development of the research, an exhaustive review of the state of the art 
of credit risk management of companies and banking institutions worldwide was carried out, identifying the best 
practices of credit risk management, as well as successful cases and cases that were not so successful or failed in their 
application. Subsequently, a compilation of machine learning models was carried out to analyze the variables that are 
considered, mathematical calculations, company classification, and linear or multivariate regressions, and to apply 
them to SMEs in Mexico City. Finally, some tests were carried out with a sample of clients of a specialized collection 
agency to determine the accuracy of the proposed machine learning model and to quantify financially the savings 
obtained in implementing the proposal.

Introduction 
According to Proaño (2022), the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is profound in financial and economic 
terms for most people and businesses, not counting the 6.3 million human lives lost because of the pandemic. In 
addition, it will harm financial systems and credit risks, resulting in business closures, damage to key sectors, job 
losses, massive business failures, reduced demand for goods and services, and a significant increase in poverty. These 
types of events brought about changes in how institutions analyze credit risk. The risk of lack of liquidity is one of the 
most important problems that companies must solve, as mentioned by Torres and Ochoa (2022), as they must calculate 
how much money they must keep in cash to pay all their obligations on time. Relating efficient liquidity management, 
as a preventive alternative in cases of financial crisis, is a way to give continuity to the company's operations. There

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The next stage of development will consist of continuous training of the models to refine accuracy, and artificial 
intelligence with NLP (Natural Language Processing) functionality will be developed, in which it will be able to write 
credit policies so that approval is automated and does not depend on a credit analyst. 
 
5.4 Validation  
The pilot test was a success because the response from customers was very positive, they gave us feedback through a 
survey to know the NPS (Net Promoter Score), and their comments to improve the model consisted of adding new 
variables to the model to make it more accurate, and the analytical dashboards were highly functional for monitoring 
and managing credit risk. 
 
6. Conclusion  
We currently live in the era of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, that is, the information era, all transactions, 
operations, and processes that we carry out every day generate historical information that is very useful for the 
generation of models that allow us to know, propose and design models for the solution of a specific problem. In this 
case, one of the challenges faced by SMEs in Mexico City and worldwide is the scarcity of liquidity, which does not 
allow the growth or continuity of these social organizations. It is worth mentioning that there are providers that offer 
credit risk software but that are not affordable for emerging companies, in addition to the fact that some require too 
many requirements, such as adjustments to infrastructure, hours of training, long implementation times, and the 
purchase of specific software. The proposed solution is affordable for any business that needs it, as well as establishing 
a risk-based culture to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

Abstract 
This study investigates the electric vehicle routing problem with time windows, partial recharges, and covering 
locations (EVRPTW-PR-CL). The goal is to find an optimal routing plan that minimizes total costs, including travel 
costs, fixed costs for electric vehicles and covering locations, and compensation costs for self-pickup services. A 
mixed integer programming model is formulated and solved by the GUROBI solver. An effective variable 
neighborhood search (VNS) algorithm is also developed for solving large-scale EVRPTW-PR-CL instances. 
Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed VNS. Additionally, managerial 
insights into delivery options and compensation costs are provided to facilitate decision-making.

Abstract 
Onshore Wells is one of the key enablers in maintaining and unlocking Oil & Gas production potential. Constructing 
Water, Oil, and Gas Onshore Wells includes a scope of supplying power to the equipment at the Wellhead area. As 
the number of new wells is expected to increase to accommodate the global demand for Oil & Gas, the power 
consumption is anticipated to increase to accommodate the power supply of these new wells. In Saudi Arabia, 
electrifying Onshore Wells is done currently by constructing Over Head Power Lines (OHPL) from the nearest tap-
off point to the Wellhead area. OHPL network has congested the area and harms the environment by adding 
greenhouse emissions. In this paper, powering Onshore Wells by Standalone Solar PV system was techno-
economically analyzed. A fixed Standalone Solar PV system of 24, 41, 171 kWp capacities was sized to meet the 
loads of Water, Oil, and Gas Onshore Wells, respectively. Depending on the distance from the tap-off point to the 
Wellhead area, the economic feasibility of adopting a Solar PV system can be determined.

Introduction  
Over the years constructing Water, Oil, and Gas wells has been considered the main factor of enabling the Kingdom 
to maintain and unlock production potential. Wells are classified into two different categories: Onshore Wells and 
Offshore Wells. In Saudi Arabia, around 10,000 new wells are expected to be drilled from 2023 to 2030 and 80% of 
these new wells are onshore wells (Rystad Energy 2024). Therefore, seeking a techno-economically feasible 
alternative to a grid power supply is considered an essential area of study. Each well adds around 96.25 MWh/year of 
energy consumption, which emissions around 69.9 Ton of CO2 yearly according to Saudi Aramco Best Practices 
published in 2020. The energy consumption was calculated depending on the average well power consumption per 
year. Onshore Wells is currently electrified by Over Head Power Lines (OHPL), which require construction efforts to 
erect poles, right of way (ROW), and a transformer from the nearest available tap of point to the wellhead area. OHPL 
network congested the area and its operation harms the environment since it produces greenhouse gasses (GHG) 
emissions.

Abstract 
The objective of the study is to reduce the high-order non-fulfillment rate, which represents 60% and generates 
significant revenue losses. A management model is proposed integrating Kanban, ABC Classification, 5S, and triple 
exponential smoothing Demand Forecasting. Kanban optimizes workflow with a 2-minute cycle reduction, improving 
efficiency. ABC Classification prioritizes orders with a 30% increase in accuracy, allocating resources effectively. 5S 
promotes an organized and clean environment, reducing errors and improving operational efficiency. The Demand 
Forecast helped anticipate future needs, facilitating production planning and maintenance of an adequate stock of 42 
units. These tools, applied after quantitative and qualitative research, address planning failures, warehouse disorder, 
inefficient workflow, and poor inventory control, with the potential to significantly reduce order non-compliance in a 
Peruvian SME Textile.

Introduction  
The textile sector is the most important sector within the manufacturing industry, covering different activities such as: 
the treatment of textile fibers for the production of yarn, and the manufacturing of clothing (Ministry of Production, 
2020). According to Comex Perú (2021), this sector represents 0.8% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, 
in Peru there was a global crisis triggered by COVID-19 in 2020, which had a significant impact on the Peruvian 
textile sector, with a drop in exports of 42.85%. The most affected subsectors were: yarns with a reduction of 49.15%, 
followed by fabrics with a drop of 37.36%, and clothing with a drop of 40.93%. This event caused productivity and 
efficiency problems in the sector (CCL 2020). One of the main problems that most textile SMEs have is that 
management is unprofessional and informal. This lack of knowledge in the use of management tools leads to a high 
rate of order non-compliance. As a result, companies experience large losses in profitability and sustained growth 
(Larios Francia 2017). For this investigation, a Mype in the textile sector was taken into consideration, which has the 
main problem of 60% non-compliance with orders. The total cost per unfulfilled order is S/. 2852.66. On the other 
hand, the research is carried out by the methodologies: 5S, Kanban, Triple Smoothing Demand Forecasting, and ABC 
with the purpose of reducing order non-compliance and improving the workflow in the Mype. The application of said 
tools mentioned above is the result of a review of articles that contain the same problem and the execution of different 
tools. Order delivery is an important and decisive component for different companies, as it directly influences the 
reliability perceived by customers. Finally, said proposal was implemented and an investment was made for the 
proposed model of S/9000 soles the project is profitable because the IRR (81.35%) is greater than the COK (11.50%). 
Furthermore, it has a net present value (NPV) of 19,858 Pen and is positive. This indicates that the proposed model is

5.3.4 Kanban implementation 
The objective is to avoid overproduction of products and have the production that must be carried out for each type of 
product. To do this, we seek to establish a Kanban board, where the company will be able to visualize the production 
that must be carried out for each type of product.

5.4 Validation  
For the next validation, Minitab was used, in which the t-student was taken into account to validate each variable. 
Therefore, with respect to the order quantity, an improvement in the order quantity of approximately 100 orders is 
displayed. In addition, there is a cycle time reduction of 2 minutes compared to what was before 5 minutes. Likewise, 
the company's profitability increased by 10%. This can then be seen in Figure 6.

6. Conclusion  
The implementation of the proposed management model, which integrates the Kanban, ABC Classification, 5S and 
Demand Forecasting tools, has shown a considerable reduction in order non-compliance in the textile MPE in which 
it has improved from 60% to 30%. %. The application of the ABC Classification has made it possible to optimize 
inventory management, prioritizing items with the highest turnover and value, thus reducing storage costs and 
improving product availability. In the ABC Classification there was an improvement of 16% for category A. While in 
category B its improvement was negative with a decrease of 1156. For category C it was reduced to 205 products. 
Regarding the Kanban, obsolete products improved by 16%. 10%.Inventory efficiency improved by 15% and 
inventory rotation improved by 8%.Likewise, the implementation of Kanban and 5S tools has contributed to 
improving the efficiency of the production process and the workflow of the customer orders through the Kanban board 
in which there was a better visualization of the number of orders. The number of orders increased by 100 orders. 
Reason why, through the application of demand forecasting techniques, it has allowed the textile company to more 
accurately anticipate the needs of its customers, adjusting production to real demand. Likewise with safety stocks 
because before there was a quantity of 600 products in warehouse, however, by implementing the Forecast, the stock 
improved to 40 products.

Abstarct 
The article addresses improving efficiency in a small baking company. The application of standardized work, 
autonomous maintenance and planned maintenance is proposed to adopt better work methods, strengthen the 
knowledge of the company's collaborators about the necessary care activities for the equipment and have a preventive 
action plan that eliminates delays. within the process. A poor distribution in the plant was identified through the route 
diagram and process activity diagram (DAP) which generated an economic impact of 20,000 PEN. With the Arena 
software, the proposed maintenance simulation was carried out, with process times and failures. It was possible to 
validate an increase in efficiency that went from 49.29% to 70.59% based on a 10% decrease in the time of activities 
carried out by the operator. Regarding economic validation, an NPV of 8,751 PEN and IRR of 57% were achieved. 
For environmental sustainability, the Leopold matrix was carried out , which obtained a result of 0.402, which is not 
very significant, that is, during the production process no raw material waste is generated.

1. Introduction
SMEs are relevant since they represent 30% of the national GDP (Quesada & Arrieta 2019) . In addition, the bakery 
industry has been chosen, because it is important in Peru, according to INEI (2022), the consumer goods industry has 
shown positive results, in this case, ""in the production of bakery products with 17.21% due to increased production of 
cakes and cookies for internal and external consumption” (p.25). Also, 16.52% of the GDP is represented by the food 
industry, and it is known that one of the most consumed foods in Peru is bread ( Zamalloa-Menacho et al. 2022). 
The objective of the research was to improve the problem of low efficiency that generated a strong economic impact 
of 20,000 PEN, it was reduced through the application of principles and techniques of industrial engineering such as 
work standardization and two pillars of TPM, which are autonomous and planned maintenance. For this, the efficiency 
KPI was used, where the times of the total process had to be taken using a stopwatch, and 49.29% was obtained for 
the efficiency before the improvements, which indicates that it is slightly close to 50%. , so the company has a 
moderate workflow with opportunities for improvement, compared to other companies that present approximately 
62%. 
The tools used are work standardization and TPM which belong to the Lean philosophy. They are relevant, since, 
according to Hernández et al. (2020), a 25% decrease in production cycle time is achieved using these tools. The 
problem found in the baking industry is that poor performance has occurred, due to different reasons such as a lack of

Figure 6. Simulation with improvements 
For the economic evaluation, the investment cost variable was taken into consideration, having a positive and negative 
scenario if this cost decreases or increases. The results are favorable with an NPV of 8,751 PEN and IRR of 57%, 
because the NPV is greater than zero and the IRR greater than the COK. 
With respect to environmental validation, an average of 0.402 was obtained through the Leopold matrix, it is between 
the ranges 0.4 < 0.49, which indicates a level of significance of little significance; That is to say, during the production 
process no raw material waste is generated, since with the products that are not sold, new products are made for other 
uses that also generate income for the company, on the other hand, after implementing the proposed improvements It 
is expected that energy consumption will be reduced due to the use of the equipment, likewise, it is expected to be 
able to eliminate the generation of solid waste, responsible consumption of water and thus be able to contribute to the 
mitigation of pollutants to the environment.

6. Conclusions 
It was possible to improve the efficiency of more than 20% of the baking SME with a result of 70.59%, through a 
reduction in the times of each activity carried out by the operator, which was also simulated in the Arena Software. 
Likewise, the chosen tools resolved the problems found through the Ishikawa and Pareto Diagram, which showed that 
the main problems were work methods with 42.49% and machines with 25.51%. Regarding validation, on the financial 
side, a positive NPV was achieved with PEN 8,751 and an IRR of 57%, which was greater than the company's COK; 
On the environmental side, the result was 0.402, which means that the process does not generate significant waste.

Abstract 
SMMEs face many challenges in a changing business environment. Entrepreneurs and management are under constant 
pressure to build a competitive edge. The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented challenges worldwide, 
including operational and strategic upheavals for South African SMMEs, putting their workforce at risk. After 200 
questionnaires were distributed and 70.5% were returned, data was analyzed, and a link between the pandemic's 
economic impact and South African SMME business operations. Findings also stressed the importance of complex 
financial support systems and showed that different alert levels can manage business impact. This study's targeted 
analysis of academic and industrial implications is important. Providing insights during a global crisis enhances the 
University of Johannesburg Department of Quality and Operations Management's knowledge. Industrially, it provides 
empirical evidence to help South African SMMEs survive health crisis-related economic challenges. Therefore, 
research findings within the broader spectrum of small enterprises were used to recommend future research. The data 
is heavily concentrated in Gauteng, which limits and may skew the study. Future researchers should include all South 
African provinces in their studies.

Introduction 
According to the National Small Business Amendment Act 26 of 2003 (Republic of South Africa 2003), in South 
Africa, small to medium enterprises (SMMEs) are described and referred to as any establishment with one or more of 
the following characteristics: 200 employees or less, annual turnover less than R64 million, or less than R10 million 
in asset value.  This highlights exactly how critical SMMEs are to the South African economy, contributing 
significantly to national Gross domestic product (GDP) and job creation.  In South Africa, the government recognizes 
the importance of SMME business activities.  The economy requires strategic plans that develop small, medium, and 
micro businesses.  The government’s National Development Plan (NDP) embraces the potential for future 
development, as well as promotes optimistic insight into upcoming events.  SMMEs must prepare to accomplish their 
short-term financial goals, plans, and budgets in order to benefit from the upcoming projects and experience South 
Africa’s growth potential (Herrington and Wood 2003).  
SMMEs are critical to the country's economic development and have been declared a ministry by the government. 
However, 50% of all South African start-up businesses fail within the first 24 months according to Ravi Govender, 
head of small enterprises at Standard Bank (Bizmag.co.za  2019).  South Africa needs job creation opportunities due 
to the rising unemployment rate at 34.9% of the population of 65 million people (Statistics South Africa 2022).  The 
high unemployment rate, in addition to the new potential technologies, is a major concern to South African SMME’s. 
This is due to the potential job loss caused by the capacity reduction benefits of new technologies.  The concern is that 
SMME’s will face challenges which would result in increased failure rates, hereby further affecting South Africa’s

Abstract 
The rapid advancement of digital technology has ushered in the ""fourth industrial revolution,"" characterized by the 
seamless integration of technologies across physical, digital, and biological domains. Within this context, the 
European Union's Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) aims to establish uniform cybersecurity standards for all digital 
products, thereby enhancing the overall cyber resilience of the EU market. This study explores the level of awareness 
and preparedness among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) regarding the CRA. A quantitative survey was 
conducted, gathering 673 responses from 416 SMEs, 160 large companies, and 91 very large enterprises. The findings 
reveal significant disparities in CRA awareness and readiness, with only 12.3% of SMEs being aware of the CRA 
compared to 83.5% of very large enterprises. SMEs reported substantial challenges including a shortage of skilled 
labor, lack of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, and uncertainties about the CRA's specifics. In contrast, very 
large enterprises focused on timeline pressures and achieving compliance. These results underscore the urgent need 
for targeted support and resources to address the specific needs of each enterprise group. Furthermore, the study 
highlights the necessity for SMEs to adopt a proactive stance in monitoring and understanding regulatory changes to 
mitigate risks associated with late compliance. The research contributes valuable insights into the effectiveness of 
current communication and implementation strategies surrounding the CRA and suggests potential areas for 
improvement to achieve the overarching goal of widespread cyber resilience. Future studies should validate these 
findings and explore the impact of enhanced regulatory pressure and diversified communication channels on 
improving CRA awareness and compliance among SMEs.

1. Introduction
The swift evolution of digital technology has catalyzed the onset of what is widely recognized as the ""fourth industrial 
revolution,"" which is characterized by the seamless integration of technologies that blur the boundaries between the 
physical, digital, and biological spheres (Schwab 2016). A critical component of this revolution is the Internet of 
Things (IoT), a framework that underpins the modern information society by facilitating the interconnection of both 
tangible and virtual entities through established and evolving technological platforms (Carr & Lesniewska 2020). 
Currently, the proliferation of IoT devices exceeds the global human population, and forecasts suggest that by 2025, 
approximately 30.9 billion devices will be operational worldwide, with over 4.3 billion within the European Union 
alone (Analytics 2020). This inevitably results in a larger attack surface due to the numerous devices that are, for the 
most part, insufficiently protected.

associations (28%), business news websites (19%), industrial conferences (9%), and trade journals (17%). A survey 
of preferred information sources indicates a majority favor business news (64 %), trade journals (51 %), television (31 
%), and social media (27 %) as primary channels. Strikingly, almost none of the participants cited government 
websites as a preferred source (<1 %). This observation highlights a critical need for government agencies to 
reevaluate outreach strategies. To enhance CRA awareness and knowledge among SMEs, these agencies should 
consider utilizing more widely frequented and accessible platforms. Multichannel communication can keep enterprises 
informed throughout the finalization phase. 
 
Given that many are concerned about the time horizon and the need for high investments to comply with CRA 
regulations, adopting earlier information strategies for SMEs is necessary. A significant portion of informed 
companies sources information from professional associations and industrial conferences. However, these channels 
attract only a minority, contributing to the existing information gap. Note the different sample sizes (n) in the figure. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.  Information Sources for SMEs Aware of CRA (n=51 ) and Preferred Information Sources for All SMEs 
(n=416 ) 
6. Conclusions  
Although the CRA has far-reaching implications for companies with products containing digital elements, which can 
lead to severe consequences after a transition period if not complied with, the majority of SMEs do not feel capable 
of implementing the legal requirements within the given time and do not consider these regulations to be reasonable 
with regard to cyber risk prevention.Furthermore, a significant information gap is evident among SMEs, which 
predominantly believe that the responsibility for adhering to regulatory requirements such as the CRA lies with the 
authorities, and do not proactively seek out information in advance. Typically, these companies only begin actively 
gathering information after the regulations have come into effect, which conflicts with the challenge of having a short 
response time.This reactive approach undermines their ability to adequately prepare for compliance, that might lead 
to rushed efforts to meet legal obligations. Consequently, there is a pressing need for SMEs to adopt a more proactive 
stance in monitoring and understanding regulatory changes to mitigate the risks associated with late compliance.  
Accordingly, there should be not only a general awareness raised about the topic but particularly about Cyber 
Resilience. The discrepancy between actively seeking information about impending regulatory changes and actual 
awareness can likely be partly attributed to the preferred communication media, such as business news websites and 
trade journals. Reporting has predominantly occurred in specialized media, which a large proportion of SMEs do not 
consult due to their general lack of awareness about Cyber Resilience.

To bridge this gap, it is crucial to diversify the channels through which information about regulatory changes and 
Cyber Resilience is disseminated. This could include leveraging more accessible and frequently used platforms by 
SMEs, such as social media, industry newsletters, and regional business networks. Additionally, targeted campaigns 
and educational initiatives could help enhance SMEs' understanding of the importance of proactive information-
seeking and the critical nature of Cyber Resilience in safeguarding their operations against emerging threats. The 
objective must be to establish a uniform baseline to address the information deficit prevalent among SMEs. This would 
provide a solid foundation that, with the assistance of skilled professionals, would facilitate implementation. Such an 
approach would enable a shift in focus towards the practical attainment of compliance rather than being mired in 
structural issues. Only through this strategy can the timely implementation of the CRA be realized, ultimately 
achieving the overarching goal of widespread cyber resilience. These assumptions need to be validated in future 
studies. 
However, this study focuses exclusively on German companies, despite the necessity for a comparative European 
perspective on the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). The structure of SMEs in Germany differs significantly from that in 
other European countries, which could influence the generalizability of the findings. Although the results underline 
the urgent need to address the situation in SMEs, it is essential to extend this research to other European countries to 
gain a comprehensive understanding of the CRA's implications across the continent. Given the imminent enforcement 
of the CRA, it is crucial to further investigate and prepare for its impact on SMEs throughout Europe. Furthermore, 
due to the participation rate, a distortion of the results cannot be ruled out, as a high number of unreported cases 
regarding awareness and preparedness is likely to prevail.

Abstract 
In this article, planning and diagnosis were carried out, in which it was evidenced from the background how the 
improvement tools generated impacts in the companies. In addition, the objectives of the research were established to 
evaluate the limitations and restrictions that the project may present. Therefore, an analysis of the KPIs was carried 
out in order to measure and have the standards of a company in the service sector. We proceeded to determine the 
problem, evidenced by reports that the company's gap is 52% efficiency. The main causes were: delays in the customer 
service process, incomplete documentation in the delivery of requirements, and lack of implementation of automated 
tools. Secondly, the issue of solution design was addressed, where the association of the causes presented above with 
the ERP and AI (chatbots) was performed. The proposed solution was designed to step by step as ERP and AI would 
greatly impact the company. In addition, a table was made on the improvement implementation budget to see the 
report and the accounting status. Finally, the validation and sustainability of the project was performed. Strategies 
were designed so that both tools work optimally with the least possible error. Therefore, optimal results were obtained 
after implementation.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, companies in the service sector are going through problems that impede their correct performance at the 
time of managing their internal and external operations. For this reason, these companies are increasingly looking for 
technological tools and methods that can generate optimal solutions by evaluating the company's problems in greater 
depth. In general, most of the companies in this sector have problems with indicators that point to poor performance 
in the customer service process. The company in which the case study is developed belongs to the service sector, the 
company started its activities in October 2012 and today performs operations of accounting advice and management 
consulting, serving various organizations belonging to different areas such as industrial, financial, commercial, etc. 
The accounting service is part of the service sector, which is a highly demanded sector for the reason of providing 
financial accounting, cost accounting, auditing, and business consulting. According to the data, the development of 
the GDP of the service sector in Peru is 61%, which is a very significant percentage in the market, mainly due to the 
great advances that are being obtained in this area. (INEI 2023). In addition, according to the Current Economic Survey 
(2020), it can be determined that 88.8% of the companies in the service sector belong to the small business group, 
with estimated sales revenues ranging from 210,000 to 630,000 soles.

From the table it can be contrasted that in the four indicators there was a significant improvement where the desired 
margins were reached. It covers an optimal scenario in the implementation since there are expected margins in the % 
of errors in the documentation, average time of attention to documentation, consultation time and number of requests 
attended. All this was obtained from the pilot tests where we have the service time indicator where the ERP tool is the 
facilitator to be able to manage the process in a faster way. The following table shows the good performance of the 
tool.

6. Conclusions 
With respect to the percentage of errors in the documentation, it can be seen that the previous performance was 33.7% 
and we were able to reduce the margin to 4.83%. This is a great step forward to expedite all the procedures in a fast 
way and to have a correct response to the client. The average time of attention to documentation was the best 
performance after the use of the ERP in the company, reaching an average of 6.38 hours in the indicator. The time of 
attention to queries was made using the AI to achieve a performance according to an adequate time that can speed up

Abstract 
This study investigated the optimization of alpha-amylase inhibitory extract production from white kidney beans 
(Phaseolus vulgaris). A Box-Behnken design was employed to systematically evaluate the effects of three factors on 
yield and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity: extraction solvent concentration (0.05 M, 0.10 M, 0.15 M), extraction 
time (1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours), and separation time (30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes). Response Surface 
Methodology (RSM) was then used to analyze complex relationships between these parameters and the desired 
outcomes. The strong correlation observed between the experimental data and RSM analysis validated 
the effectiveness of the optimization strategy. The optimal conditions, yielded an extract with the highest specific 
activity (0.111 units/mg) using a PBS concentration of 0.101 M, an extraction time of 1 hour, and a separation time 
of 30 minutes. Interestingly, a slightly modified set of parameters (0.105 M PBS, 1-hour extraction, and 30.01 minutes 
separation) resulted in the highest extract yield percentage (11.89%). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a 
combined Box-Behnken design and RSM approach for optimizing the extraction of bioactive compounds from natural 
sources. This paves the way for large-scale production of a potent alpha-amylase inhibitory extract and its exploration 
in future health applications.

They focused on improving efficiency, identifying optimal conditions for specific targets (chlorophyll, phenolics, 
antioxidants), and exploring novel techniques (ultrasonic treatment) while as this study aimed to optimize the 
extraction process for alpha-amylase inhibitory activity in white kidney beans. It focused on three independent 
variables (PBS concentration, extraction time, and separation time) and their impact on two responses (percentage 
yield and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity). 
 
 In addition to the outcome of research, this study successfully identified the optimal extraction conditions to maximize 
alpha-amylase inhibitory activity, potentially leading to potent white kidney bean extracts for further health benefits 
research, while as combined legume extraction studies which each study presented different outcomes; Cubas et al. 
(2008) showed optimized chlorophyll extraction in green beans with five repetitions as the key factor; Gomes et al. 
(2019) established the best conditions for phenolic compound extraction in Carioca beans (70% acetone, 25°C, 1:15 
ratio), Yang et al. (2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of ultrasonic treatment for extracting antioxidants from 
common beans, achieving a seven-fold increase in efficiency. In similarities, both sets of research highlight the 
importance of optimizing extraction methods for legumes. They all utilize Response Surface Methodology (RSM) as 
a valuable tool for identifying optimal conditions. For future research directions, the application of the optimized white 
kidney bean extraction conditions to larger-scale production and investigating its impact on alpha-amylase inhibition 
in vivo (within a living organism) including exploring the potential health benefits of the extracted white kidney bean 
compounds. Furthermore, the utilizing RSM to optimize ultrasonic treatment for alpha-amylase inhibitory extract in 
white kidney beans (combining findings from both sets of research) and investigating the applicability of the optimized 
conditions for extracting similar compounds from other legumes. 
 
In conclusion, the presented results showcase diverse applications of RSM optimization in legume extraction. While 
the white kidney bean study focuses on a specific target compound and its activity, the combined studies offer broader 
insights into optimizing extraction methods for various legume components. Both sets of research pave the way for 
further investigation into the health benefits of legumes and the development of improved extraction techniques. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study successfully employed a randomized Box-Behnken design to identify the optimal conditions for extracting 
white kidney bean extract with maximized yield and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity. Under these parameters, the 
extract achieved a promising yield of 11.89 % and a notable inhibitory activity of 0.111 units/g. However, future 
research could research deeper into the specific components responsible for the inhibitory activity. Employing high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) would enable the quantification of total alpha-amylase inhibitors and 
active glycoproteins within the white kidney beans. This approach holds the potential to refine extraction conditions 
even further, potentially leading to even higher yields of extracts boasting even more potent inhibitory activity. By 
optimizing the extraction process based on specific bioactive components, this research paves the way for the 
development of more effective functional foods and nutraceuticals derived from white kidney beans.

Abstract 
The burgeoning market for plant-based meat alternatives reflects a growing consumer focus on health, affordability, 
and environmental sustainability. However, replicating the mouthfeel and texture of real meat remains a significant 
hurdle for these products. This study delves into a novel approach that leverages the combined power of 3D printing 
technology and biosurfactants to overcome this challenge. Soy protein isolate (SPI) formed the foundation for our 
plant-based meat analogues. We embarked on a meticulous investigation, exploring the substitution of traditional oil 
with various biosurfactants at different concentrations (20% to 100%) within the 3D printing ink formulation. The 
spectrum of biosurfactants employed encompassed acetylated starch (ACT), octenyl succinic anhydride starch (OSA), 
and ethyl (hydroxyethyl) cellulose (HEC). The analysis of the rheological properties, which govern the flow and 
deformation of the ink, unveiled a captivating interplay between the type and concentration of the biosurfactants. 
Formulations containing specific combinations – 40% HEC (HEC40%), 40% OSA (OSA40%), and 60% ACT 
(ACT60%) – exhibited exceptional printability. These precise ratios yielded a remarkable increase in viscosity 
recovery with elevated biosurfactant content. Additionally, they demonstrated superior structural strength, enhanced 
storage stability, and a gel-like character – all essential attributes for successful 3D printing of realistic textured meat 
alternatives. These findings illuminate the immense potential of biosurfactants, particularly HEC40%, OSA40%, and 
ACT60%, to revolutionize the textural landscape of 3D-printed plant-based meat alternatives derived from soy protein 
isolate. Their remarkable ability to augment printability and texture paves the way for the development of more 
appealing and truly meat-like plant-based meat substitutes, further bolstering the burgeoning market for these 
sustainable and health-conscious food options.

Abstract 
The study addressed the negative impact of mining tailings on the environment and the high storage costs in the 
Peruvian mining industry. The objective was to evaluate the technological and environmental feasibility of replacing 
traditional sand in concrete with polymetallic tailings within the framework of the circular economy. Concrete 
mixtures with polymetallic tailings were prepared and evaluated for properties such as workability, unit weight, 
temperature, air content, and strength. It was demonstrated that polymetallic tailings can partially replace sand in 
conventional concrete for basic structural applications such as floors, walls, and pedestals. The tests indicated that the 
concrete temperature remained within acceptable limits, averaging 20.2°C, and the air content was low, favoring 
material strength. The unit weight of all mixtures corresponded to normal-weight concrete, with values exceeding 
2300 kg/m³. The compressive strength of concrete with 40% sand replacement by tailings reached 164.6 kg/cm² after 
28 days of curing, demonstrating its suitability for plain concrete applications. These results validate the feasibility of 
using polymetallic tailings in concrete production, contributing to reducing environmental impact and storage costs 
associated with mining tailings.

Introduction 
Mining is one of the most important economic sectors in Peru. According to the Peruvian Institute of Economics 
(2021), the participation of the mining sector in Peru's GDP is 8.7%. In 2020, 2.15 million fine metric tons (MT) of 
copper, 2,727 fine MT of silver, and 87.53 fine MT of gold were produced (Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru 
MINEM 2020). According to the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Peru (2020), as of 2020, the country ranked second 
in the world for copper and silver production, and eighth for gold production. This underscores that mining is a crucial 
economic activity in Peru, creating jobs, generating tax revenue, boosting exports, and providing various societal 
benefits. 
As illustrated in Figure 1, the generic life cycle of mineral resources begins with primary production, where minerals 
are extracted from natural sources and subsequently undergo refining, flotation, and smelting processes. Following 
this, the refined materials are processed through manufacturing to become the materials we use today. After the usage 
phase of these products, waste management is implemented, during which minerals that can still be utilized in new 
products are recycled. Each process generates waste, which is stored and directed to various landfills.

previous studies that highlight the viability of using tailings in concrete (Hillier et al. 1999).However, some deviations 
were noted, particularly in the concrete mixtures with 100% sand replacement by tailings. These mixtures exhibited 
inconsistent behavior, such as inadequate setting and visible dampness in the interior parts. This inconsistency can be 
attributed to the high fine content of the tailings, which affects the water-cement ratio and the overall setting process 
(Kosmatka & Panarese, 2006). The formation of rust-colored stains and water absorption observed in these specimens 
further underscores the need for careful management of the tailing's composition and moisture content. 
 
These deviations highlight the importance of conducting further research to optimize the mix design and ensure the 
stability of concrete mixtures with high tailing content. Future studies should explore the use of additives, such as 
setting accelerators, to improve the workability and strength of concrete with a higher proportion of tailings (Zabaleta 
García  1992). Additionally, long-term durability tests and environmental impact assessments, including leaching 
tests, are essential to validate the sustainability and safety of using polymetallic tailings in concrete production (Hillier 
et al.1999).In conclusion, the results of this study validate the technological and environmental feasibility of using 
polymetallic tailings as a partial replacement for sand in concrete production. The findings are consistent with previous 
research, demonstrating that tailings can be effectively incorporated into concrete mixtures, provided that the mix 
design is carefully managed. However, the observed deviations in mixtures with high tailing content indicate the need 
for further optimization and testing. Future research should focus on enhancing the mix design, conducting 
comprehensive durability tests, and ensuring the environmental safety of tailings-incorporated concrete. By addressing 
these areas, the potential for sustainable and cost-effective use of mining tailings in construction can be fully realized. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The main findings of the study indicate that polymetallic tailings can partially replace sand in conventional concrete 
for basic structural applications. Concrete mixtures were prepared with 40% and 100% sand replacement by 
polymetallic tailings, and properties such as workability, unit weight, temperature, air content, and compressive 
strength were evaluated. The results showed that the concrete temperature remained within acceptable limits, 
averaging 20.2°C, and the air content was low, favoring material strength. The unit weight of all mixtures 
corresponded to normal-weight concrete, with values exceeding 2300 kg/m³. The compressive strength of concrete 
with 40% sand replacement reached 164.6 kg/cm² after 28 days of curing, demonstrating its suitability for plain 
concrete applications. The importance of this research lies in the need to find sustainable solutions for the management 
of mining tailings, which represent a significant economic burden and a potential environmental risk. By reusing these 
tailings in concrete production, the study contributes to the circular economy and mitigates the negative impacts 
associated with their storage. This approach benefits the mining sector and provides the construction industry with an 
alternative material for concrete production, thus reducing the demand for virgin raw materials. 
 
The contributions to the field of study are significant, as this work demonstrates the technological and environmental 
feasibility of using polymetallic tailings in concrete production. The research provides empirical data on the 
mechanical and physical properties of concrete with tailings, setting a precedent for future studies in this area. 
Additionally, it offers a practical and scalable solution for mining waste management, aligning with global 
sustainability and waste management strategies. Finally, observations and suggestions for further study are offered. It 
is recommended to conduct additional strength tests to ensure the long-term durability of the material and leaching 
tests to ensure its environmental safety. Additionally, exploring the use of setting accelerators for specimens 
containing tailings is suggested, as the use of tailings complicates the setting process and may affect strength test 
results. Minimizing contamination during tailings handling is also crucial. Future research should consider expanding 
the range of sand replacement and evaluating the impact of different types of tailings on concrete properties.

Abstract 
This study aims to examine the influence of burnout and self-efficacy on career satisfaction, with work-life balance 
serving as a mediating variable among banking employees in Indonesia. Burnout is a significant issue in the banking 
sector, leading to decreased employee productivity and well-being. Conversely, self-efficacy, or an individual's belief 
in their ability to complete tasks, can enhance job performance and career satisfaction. Work-life balance is considered 
a crucial factor that can influence both burnout and self-efficacy. The research employed a quantitative approach 
through a survey of 163 respondents from various banks across Indonesia. Data were collected using a questionnaire 
designed to measure burnout, self-efficacy, work-life balance, and career satisfaction. The analysis was conducted 
using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach, utilizing the Smart PLS 
software. The results show that burnout has a significant negative impact on career satisfaction, while self-efficacy 
has a significant positive effect. Furthermore, work-life balance plays a significant mediating role between burnout 
and career satisfaction, as well as between self-efficacy and career satisfaction. Employees who manage to maintain 
a healthy work-life balance are likely to experience lower levels of burnout and higher self-efficacy, which ultimately 
enhances their career satisfaction. These findings have practical implications for bank management in developing 
strategies to improve employees' work-life balance, such as offering flexible work hours and employee wellness 
programs. Thus, organizations can create a healthier and more productive work environment that enhances overall 
employee career satisfaction and performance.

Introduction 
The banking industry in Indonesia has a strategic role in supporting the national economy, but employees in this sector 
often face high work pressure. Excessive work demands, strict performance targets, and the need to maintain 
relationships with customers have created a stressful work environment. This phenomenon has the potential to cause 
career satisfaction problems, where employees feel dissatisfied with their career development despite working hard. 
Based on a report from the Indonesia Bankers Association (ABI), career satisfaction levels among banking employees 
have tended to decline in recent years, indicating significant challenges in the banking work environment.

Research by Greenhaus et al. (2003) also supports these findings, showing that work-life balance plays an important 
role in improving career satisfaction by strengthening the relationship between self-confidence and employee control 
over their work. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study aims to examine the effect of burnout and self-efficacy on career satisfaction with work-life balance as a 
mediating variable in banking employees in Indonesia. Based on the results of the analysis, it was found that 
employees who experienced burnout were less likely to be able to maintain work-life balance and feel less satisfied 
with their career development. Employees with high levels of self-efficacy are more confident in managing work tasks 
and balancing personal life, which ultimately increases their career satisfaction. Work-life balance has a very important 
role as a mediator in the relationship between burnout and self-efficacy to career satisfaction. Work-life balance has 
been proven to reduce the negative impact of burnout and increase the positive influence of self-efficacy on the career 
satisfaction of banking employees. This research emphasizes the importance of maintaining a work-life balance, and 
shows that high self-efficacy can help employees cope with work stress and increase their career satisfaction. 
Conversely, burnout hinders employees from achieving a healthy work-life balance, thereby lowering career 
satisfaction.

Abstract 
Demand forecasting is a critical component of supply chain management, enabling businesses to align product supply 
with customer demand. Various methods exist for predicting demand, each with its strengths and limitations. In this 
paper, we propose a hybrid grey-neural network model to enhance prediction accuracy. The grey prediction model is 
effective for forecasting with small data sets but can be sensitive to anomalies, leading to significant errors. On the 
other hand, artificial neural networks are robust in handling complex data patterns, yet they require large-scale, 
wellrepresentative training data, which can be challenging to obtain. By integrating these two approaches, our hybrid 
model aims to reduce prediction errors and improve forecast stability. The results demonstrate the model's 
effectiveness in achieving more accurate demand predictions, addressing the limitations of each method individually.

1.Introduction
Demand forecasting is a vital component of supply chain management, influencing almost every decision related to 
the supply chain. However, it remains one of the most challenging aspects of supply chain planning due to the inherent 
volatility of demand. Effective demand forecasting can enhance supplier relations, improve procurement terms, 
optimize resource utilization, ensure better capacity management, and lead to improved customer service and product 
lifecycle management. Despite these benefits, the unpredictable nature of demand makes accurate forecasting a 
complex task.

approach can lead to more effective inventory management, better alignment of supply with demand, and reduced 
supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead, the next steps involve comprehensive data collection and further 
development of the Hybrid GNN model to refine its forecasting capabilities. The model will be tested for its efficiency 
using error analysis techniques to ensure its robustness and reliability in various scenarios. Upon successful validation, 
the model will be implemented for practical demand forecasting applications, providing valuable insights for future 
supply chain decisions. This approach aims to address the challenges of demand uncertainty and enhance overall 
supply chain performance.

Abstract 
The emergence of Industry 4.0 technologies and the subsequent digital transformation necessitates a paradigm shift in 
quality management practices. This shift has led to the development of Quality 4.0, a nascent field with limited 
research on its application within specific industries, particularly the medical technology sector. This study aims to 
bridge this gap by establishing an instrument to assess the awareness and readiness for Quality 4.0 implementation 
among Malaysian medical technology companies. The research employed a three-phased approach. Phase 1 involved 
a comprehensive literature review to identify key factors influencing Quality 4.0 implementation readiness. In Phase 
2, a survey instrument was developed based on the literature review. This instrument underwent rigorous validation 
by a panel of academic and industry experts before pilot testing. Phase 3 utilized the pilot study results and respondent 
feedback to refine the survey. Subsequently, the final instrument was administered to six case study organizations 
within the medical technology sector located in Johor, Malaysia. Data analysis of the field survey results assessed the 
current awareness and readiness levels of each organization, generating an ""organizational score."" These scores were 
then used to categorize the case studies into five distinct Quality 4.0 implementation readiness levels. This research 
contributes valuable insights into the current state of Quality 4.0 awareness and readiness within the Malaysian 
medical technology sector. The developed instrument offers a valuable tool for future research and practical 
applications, enabling medical technology companies to evaluate their own readiness for adopting Quality 4.0 
practices.

1. Introduction
Established quality management standards, like ISO 9001 and ISO 13485, have traditionally been the backbone of 
ensuring organizations meet pre-defined quality standards. While these standards offer a structured approach, the field 
has also been heavily influenced by the philosophies of quality gurus like W. Edwards Deming, Joseph Juran, and 
Philip Crosby (Juran 1992; Deming 1982; Crosby 1979). Their emphasis on continuous improvement, customer focus, 
and data-driven decision-making complements the structured nature of established standards. However, the advent of 
Industry 4.0 presents both opportunities and challenges, prompting a paradigm shift towards Quality 4.0 (Fleisch et

Abstract 
Effective inventory management is critical for firms to maximize efficiency, minimize waste, and maintain a healthy 
financial position. This research investigates the causes of medicine expiration in the warehouse setting. Expired 
medications not only represent a waste of resources but can also pose safety risks if inadvertently distributed. 
Understanding the root causes of expiration is a crucial step toward improving warehouse operations and inventory 
control. The research applies several analytical techniques to diagnose the problem. ABC analysis is used to categorize 
medicines based on their annual usage value, allowing the team to focus on the most critical inventory items. Turnover 
ratio calculations provide insights into the velocity at which different medicines are sold, highlighting slow-moving 
stock that is prone to expiration. A fishbone diagram is constructed to systematically explore the potential causes of 
expiration, covering factors such as forecasting accuracy, storage conditions, packaging, and supplier reliability. 
Finally, a Pareto chart is leveraged to identify the vital few medicine categories that account for the majority of 
expiration issues. Through this multifaceted approach, the project team can uncover several key drivers of medicine 
expiration. Inaccurate demand forecasting emerges as a primary culprit, leading to the procurement of excess inventory 
that exceeds shelf-life. Suboptimal storage conditions, such as forecasting and sales, also contribute to the accelerated 
degradation of certain medicines. The findings of this work have broader implications for inventory management 
practices across various industries.

1. Introduction
Warehouse and inventory management are some of the most important resources that many institutions and 
organizations take into consideration. Therefore, many organizations and institutions form a department concerned 
with managing stores and warehouses, which ultimately aims to optimize the use of inventory they own. Moreover, 
due to the importance of inventory management, there are many types of warehouses, and it depends on the type of 
institution or organization. These warehouses may be owned or rented temporarily. In addition, there are many types 
of warehouses, such as fuel warehouses, raw materials warehouses, customs warehouses, records warehouses, and

Abstract 
Abstract: In the current climate of uncertainty, corporate management is extremely challenging, and the risk of 
bankruptcy is increasing due to deteriorating business performance. Corporate bankruptcies cause losses to 
stakeholders such as business partners, investors, and financial institutions, necessitating the development of models 
that can prevent or detect bankruptcies early. While many studies, including Altman's research, have been conducted 
on bankruptcy discrimination models, machine learning models, which offer objective and highly accurate predictions, 
have become mainstream in recent years. I focus on the number of feature and construct bankruptcy discriminant 
model using two machine learning methods, Random Forest(hereafter: RF) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine 
(hereafter: Light GBM) , and study the effect of differences in the number of features on the discrimination accuracy 
of machine learning methods. The target data consists of publicly traded companies in the six industries with the 
highest number of bankruptcies, based on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 33-sector classification. These industries are 
Construction, Real Estate, Services, Retail, Electric Equipment, and Wholesale, excluding Electric Power and Gas, 
Banking, Securities and Commodity Futures, Insurance, and Other Financial industries. Financial indicators were 
obtained using Nikkei NEEDS-Financial QUEST, a comprehensive economic database service by Nikkei Inc. The 
dataset was created from the financial indicator data of companies in the six industries with the highest number of 
bankruptcies between 1990 and 2021. 
For features, financial indicators and NW indicators were used. Considering comprehensiveness, there were 161 
financial indicators and 12 NW indicators, totaling 173 indicators. In this study, we create three types of datasets with 
various numbers of features to train machine learning models. In many cases, datasets are an essential element for 
improving the performance and accuracy of AI models with the development of AI technology, and the importance 
of datasets is increasing. The first is dataset using only financial indicators (hereafter: financial dataset). The second 
is dataset using both financial indicators and NW indicators (hereafter: investment dataset). In this case, companies 
for which NW indicators could not be calculated were excluded from the analysis. Therefore, the amount of data is 
smaller than that of financial data. The third is dataset excluding NW indicators from investment data (hereafter: 
comparative dataset). Next, I describe the overall picture of the constructed model. A total of 108 models combining 
six types of industries, three types of features, three resampling methods to address imbalanced data, and two machine 
learning methods were constructed. The resampling methods include k-means under sampling (hereafter: k-means), 
SMOTE, and SMOTE + Edited Nearest Neighbor (hereafter: SMOTE+ENN). I used RF and Light GBM as machine 
learning methods. Recall is particularly emphasized in the model evaluation. Recall is defined as Recall = TP / (TP + 
FN), using True Positive (TP) and False Negative (FN). This study focuses on the number of TPs to determine the 
features for bankruptcy discrimination. In other words, the model with the highest number of TPs is determined to be 
the optimal bankruptcy discrimination model. In doing so, the selected and useful financial indicators and NW 
indicators will be confirmed. Next, the combination of useful machine learning methods and resampling methods for 
each industry will be verified. To obtain a highly accurate bankruptcy discrimination mode, the number of features 
will be gradually reduced. Specifically, we conduct bankruptcy discriminant analysis while gradually reducing the 
number of indicators from 173 to 2, compare the accuracy after changing the number of features, and determine the

Abstract 
The gyroid pattern, inspired by the natural design found in butterfly wings, combines remarkable strength and 
flexibility. This study examined sandwich panels using gyroid structures as the core, with outer layers made of carbon 
fiber-reinforced epoxy. These gyroid cores were produced using a 3D printer with three varying relative densities: 
10%, 15%, and 20%. Polylactic acid served as the material for printing the gyroid structures. The printed gyroid cores 
were then assembled into sandwich panels using epoxy resin between the CFRP laminates. Additionally, polyurethane 
foam (PUF) was used to fill the cavities of the gyroid cores in another set of samples. Flexural and compression tests 
were conducted to assess the mechanical properties of the sandwiches. The findings showed that the specific facing 
stress and core shear strength of the sandwich composites increased with higher sandwich density. The core density 
was a key factor in determining the flexural properties of the sandwiches. Incorporating PUF improved the deflection 
at maximum stress and the load sustained after failure. However, the gyroid core sandwiches exhibited higher 
compression strength, modulus, and energy absorption, as well as better specific properties, compared to the PUF-
filled gyroid core sandwiches of the same density.

Introduction  
The lightweight nature of aircraft structures is crucial, as it enhances fuel efficiency, payload capacity, performance, 
and safety, while also reducing CO2 emissions. Sandwich structures are vital in aircraft design and construction due 
to their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. These structures consist of two thin, strong outer layers, often made from 
composite laminates or aluminum, with a lightweight core material, such as foam or honeycomb, in between. This 
method of construction offers significant benefits in aircraft design, providing both rigidity and strength while 
effectively distributing and bearing loads. Additionally, sandwich structures offer excellent vibration-dampening 
properties, reducing noise transmission and improving passenger comfort. They also act as thermal insulators, helping 
to maintain interior temperatures (Al Rifaie et al. (2022) and Le et al. (2021)). 
Nature-inspired designs have been identified as key to enhancing materials' mechanical properties and functionality 
beyond their physical limitations. Such bio-inspired structures are increasingly popular in the structural industry. Many

Also, the specific energy absorbed during the compression tests of both types of sandwiches is presented. The energy 
absorbed demonstrates a linear enhancement with the progressive increase in sandwich density. This relationship 
underlines the critical role that sandwich, or core density, plays in influencing the capacity of the sandwiches to absorb 
energy under compression loading conditions. Furthermore, a comparative analysis between the two types of 
sandwiches indicates that, at equivalent sandwich densities, the specific energy absorbed by the unfilled sandwich is 
higher than that of the PUF-filled gyroid core sandwich. This observation aligns with the earlier-discussed trend in 
compression strength, where the unfilled variant exhibited higher compression strength. The superior energy 
absorption of the unfilled sandwich implies that, despite having a similar density, the structural characteristics and 
material composition contribute to enhanced energy dissipation in the absence of PUF filling. The relation between 
density, core material, and energy absorption highlights the efforts involved in optimizing the design and functionality 
of such composite structures for specific applications. In composite structures, overall properties are sometimes 
dominated by the component with higher properties. The minimum impact of PUF on the compression properties of 
the sandwich plausibility is due to the polyurethane having lower mechanical properties than PLA as the gyroid 
structure material. 
 
Variations in the specific mechanical properties by the differences in core density, materials, and topology broaden 
the application of such structures. The properties of the structure can be tailored and optimized based on the 
requirements of the application designs. Different optimizations, such as strength, weight, thermal properties, or other 
performance measurements, can be achieved by variating the core density and structure. 
 
6. Conclusions 
This paper examines the use of bio-inspired gyroid structures, at varying densities, as core materials in sandwich 
panels, and the impact of adding PUF material to these cores. The gyroid cores were sandwiched between CFRP 
laminates to create composite panels, while another set of panels used gyroid cores filled with PUF. The study 
aimed to explore how core density and topology affect the flexural properties of these panels. 
 
The findings reveal that increasing the core density significantly enhances flexural properties, including maximum 
bending load, facing stress, and core shear strength. When comparing panels with gyroid cores to those with PUF-
filled gyroid cores at the same density, the facing stress and core shear strength were similar. This suggests that core 
density plays a more critical role in determining flexural properties than the core's topology. However, integrating 
PUF into the gyroid core improved the panels' ability to withstand deflection before failure, enhancing their strength 
and toughness. 
 
Both compression strength, modulus, and energy absorption increased with core density in both cases, but gyroid core 
sandwiches consistently showed higher values than their PUF-filled counterparts at the same density. The statistical 
analysis indicates that the tested structures reliably replicate performance levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of 
the design and material choices.

Abstract 
Queueing theory is an essential and fair way to handle customer flow when resources are scarce when studying line 
creation, functioning, and reasons. Not implementing a queueing system to manage excess capacity can have negative 
consequences. This study aims to optimize the queue management system at the Barbershop by addressing issues such 
as prolonged wait times and lineups due to increased afternoon customer arrivals, leading to worker fatigue and 
extended operating hours. The goal is to have a comprehensive analysis of Barbershop's queueing system, focusing 
on waiting times, queue lengths, and service rates using Kendall notation and queueing theory formulas and perform 
using MATLAB software. The results show that the barbershop's current utilization rate is 88.33%, exceeding working 
hours. The probability of no customers in the queue is 12.43%, and the total capacity is 7%. The expected number of 
customers in the queue and queuing system is 1.3631 and 2.9141, respectively. The expected waiting time is 38 
minutes in the system and 18 minutes in the queue. The proposed queuing theory reduces this to 55.56%. The proposed 
queueing system at the barbershop significantly improves service performance, reducing waiting times and potential 
customer departures, compared to the current system with only two customers. Future research should involve more 
observations, data collection, and continuous improvement using modern approaches and alternative methodologies.

1. Introduction
Operations research is an analytical approach to problem-solving and decision-making that is helpful in organizational 
management, taking into account all feasible options. Queueing theory, which examines lines' formation, operation, 
and causes, is a necessary and equitable method of managing customer flow when resources are limited and the failure 
to establish a queue method to handle overcapacity has adverse effects (Queue-It 2020). A barbershop that provides 
services would usually have longer queues at the end of the week, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays, since most 
individuals are getting ready for the weekend, it is more prone to delays and queues. In a case wherein a customer 
leaves, who is unlikely to return, it results in significant losses for the business. On average, people often will only 
stand in line for 14 minutes when waiting in person or waiting lines (Skiplino  2023). An extended waiting time, 
poorly organized queue, and several leaving customers without receiving the service may lead to negative feedback 
and a decline in a reputation which are some of the main reasons many companies lose business. According to a 
business survey, only longer wait times were the reason for the confirmed 75% clientele loss (Ching  2022).

Abstract 
The printing industry has a long history of sharing information and creativity, which are crucial in knowledge 
dissemination and artistic expression. However, the Philippine printing industry faces challenges like digital 
competition, technology advancements, and changing consumer preferences. This study in the Book Manufacturing 
Firm aims to investigate production efficiency through Queuing System analysis and Promodel simulation to enhance 
overall productivity. Queuing theory is vital in optimizing production flow, reducing errors, and increasing 
productivity in the book manufacturing firm. The goal of this study is to enhance the firm’s manufacturing process 
and boost productivity by introducing additional service channels and improving existing processes rather than 
developing new ones. This intervention aims to reduce waiting times and improve service rates, optimizing system 
performance measures. The paper explores key manufacturing process behaviors using the single-server, multiple-
customer model and multiple-server, multiple-customer model. Data analysis from six workstations reveals that 
interventions in the gathering and cutting stations significantly increase handbook production. Implementing a queuing 
system and adding service channels to the gathering and cutting sections of the proposed flow process increases the 
output by 63.64%, effectively eliminating bottlenecks and enhancing overall productivity. ProModel results indicate 
a 5.11% decrease in travel time for gathering and a 4.17% decrease for cutting, demonstrating improved system 
efficiency. Incorporating service channels is confirmed to eliminate bottlenecks and enhance overall productivity. 
Recommendations include implementing lean manufacturing, employee training, performance monitoring, and 
automation. These strategies emphasize operational success and continuous improvement for sustained growth and 
competitiveness. Future research may explore financial analysis for strategic decision-making.

5.2Limitations and Future Research 
This study focuses solely on the 3Ms - Man, Machine, and Method, excluding considerations of Materials, Monetary 
aspects, and the Environment at a book manufacturing firm. It is essential to acknowledge this limitation as it provides 
a scope for future research to explore other critical factors affecting the production process system in the book 
manufacturing firm. For future researchers, exploring the financial aspect of the company is recommended. Analyzing 
the financial performance, cost structures, revenue streams, and profitability of the company can offer valuable 
insights for strategic decision-making and long-term sustainability. Understanding the financial aspect of the business 
will not only enable a thorough evaluation of its operational efficiency but also show its growth potential. 
In addition to the current findings, this paper also recommend further strategies to enhance operational efficiency and 
address production challenges within the company. Embracing lean manufacturing principles, such as the 5S 
methodology, can significantly improve operational efficiency by organizing workspaces, standardizing processes, 
and maintaining cleanliness (Akram et al. 2019). Providing training programs to enhance employee skills and 
knowledge is crucial for increasing productivity and empowering a skilled workforce Establishing a system for regular 
performance monitoring and continuous improvement ensures sustained growth and efficiency. Introducing a sorting 
machine for the gathering process can streamline operations, reduce manual labor, and improve efficiency, leading to 
faster processing times and increased productivity (Arulsamy et al.2023). Additionally, future researchers can explore 
utilizing other operations research tools to address the company's production challenges such as Linear Programming, 
Simulation Modeling, and Decision Analysis. These tools can offer valuable insights and optimization strategies for 
enhancing the production process system.

Abstract 
The footwear industry has a rich history, and producing comfort and style is one of the critical factors affecting 
consumers' choices in purchasing. Local shoemakers in the Philippines face challenges due to intense competition in 
the rapidly growing global market. This study focuses on analyzing the production of the footwear manufacturing 
industry to identify and provide solutions to pressing problems such as inefficiencies. The goal is to conduct a thorough 
analysis and improve the company's system performance measures, which include idle time, waiting time, arrival rate, 
and service rate. This study evaluates the production of the footwear manufacturing industry to determine and resolve 
inefficiencies using queuing theory, particularly the single-server, multiple-customer model, whereas the strategy 
provides significant insights into the manufacturing operations, which benefits the company's development and 
progress. Through queuing theory model application and Promodel Simulation, the three workstations have decreased 
idle time by 18% in sewing, 8% in upper making, and 6% in shoemaking. It proves that the study has achieved notable 
results in minimizing idle time thus, increasing work efficiencies using Kendall's notation. However, to further 
explore, this study recommends examining the monetary sector in the aspect of 5M's using the Game theory, and DEA 
CCR Model to equal with competitors and market as this approach may offer external factors to enhance the 
effectiveness and practicality of the solutions that this study has provided.

Introduction 
Company operations rely significantly on analyzing several connected processes, including reaching the system queue, 
standing in line for a while, and worker utilization rate. One of the effective approaches for analyzing the performance 
systems is to apply the Queuing Theory, which may be depicted as network queues in the manufacturing business. 
The Queuing theory model is a fundamental mathematical principle in understanding the behavior of queues, waiting 
times, and production flow of diverse industries such as transportation, telecommunications, services, and 
manufacturing (Xiong 2023). It plays a prominent role in aiding and determining where in the manufacturing processes 
that requires optimization and enhanced efficiency to foster growth and development in the company. Moreover, it 
facilitates better resource allocations, increased flexibility, and improved quality control within the organization. By 
leveraging mathematical models and simulations, the queuing theory model provides better development in the 
systems, improving the overall quality performance of a company.

Figure 3. Entity Summary of the Proposed Process of Footwear Manufacturing Company 
 
Through the ProModel Simulation, Figure 3 shows the accumulated increase of production in the new process, from 
136 pairs from the present process, the footwear company increased the production to 172 pairs of footwear.  
 
5. Conclusion  
In applying queuing theory to the single server multiple customer model, this paper identified bottlenecks and idle 
time that caused production delays in the shoe manufacturing procedure. Utilizing Kendall notation allowed this paper 
to highlight arrival rates, server availability, and the capacity of a system and thus, derived an in-depth system analysis 
in the shoe manufacturing company. The main goal of the study was to identify bottlenecks that lead to idle time and 
ineffectiveness in production, the analysis in Tables 4 and 5 shows that the utilization rate in workstations 2, 3, and 6 
was low. These workstations operated the lowest station rating where the task was finished quickly due to the arrival 
of only three materials, resulting in higher idle time. Utilized the queuing theory Kendall notation model, the paper 
was used to define system performance and unveiled issues within shoe manufacturing, findings also uncovered the 
difference in workstation efficiency, resulting in the transfer of workload to increase productivity and decrease time 
delays. In Table 2.  
 
Tabulated Computed Data for Single Server Multiple Customer Proposed Process, workstation 1 gained a 68% 
utilization rate, whereas workstation 6 had only 23% which points out a need to improve the production procedure. 
Table 4 Computed Data for Single Server Multiple Customer Current Process and Utilization Rate, workstation 1 
shows an 18% increase in utilization, workstation 7 only an increase of 1% but in combination improves the total 
utilization rate. Lastly, the goal was to evaluate and measure the current arrival process to improve and minimize 
transportation time and idle time of a Poisson process. Table 3 provides the results of the reduction in idle time across 
different sections when the process was restructured and using promodel simulation software. The idle time decreased 
workstation 2 by 8%, workstation 3 by 8%, and workstation 6 by 6%. The queuing theory is utilized to delineate the 
states of the stages of the company's process through a quantitative data-driven framework (Marsudi & herlina, 2018). 
The final recommendation from the study is to utilize the calculation of utilization rate and probability of idle 
workstations. These calculations are critical factors in identifying system improvements within the three stations and 
thus aid in theorizing methods that can reduce idle time and increase production level and work performance.  
 
5.1 Practical Implications of the Study 
Utilizing the queuing theory is a vital instrument for a manufacturing company as it elaborately identifies where and 
how the process can be streamlined and optimized through a capacity objective. The study found that implementing 
the queuing theory approach it may increase the utilization rate of the worker and a key to be efficient in performing 
work at the most effective rate. Furthermore, in an article by Salawu et al. 2020, the studies were conducted to create 
a method in an advanced manufacturing environment where waiting time was minimized by the queuing theory case 
model found also in the study with data illustrating the queuing model level achieved optimal values showing how the 
queuing model approach can amend the waiting time in an advanced manufacturing setting.  
This paper offers solutions that can aid the manufacturing problems experienced by the company through the use of 
queuing theory, the study determines that there are bottlenecks in the process. By implementing the queuing theory, 
businesses were able to strive for the better (Stevens, 2021).

sector. This paper addresses issues by applying the queuing theory model in the shoe manufacturing industry. Further, 
future studies could explore integrating the analysis to measure the cost-effectiveness of suggested solutions. 
Additionally, exploring how workforce training programs and job rotation may impact the adoption of manufacturing 
and JIT practices could add value to the company. 
Also, future research could enhance the queuing theory model by incorporating more operations research 
methodologies such as Game Theory and the DEA CCR Model to keep up with the competitors and trends of the 
market. These approaches could offer insights into the external factors that affect the company's production. To 
improve the effectiveness and practicality of the solutions, additional investigation of the fluctuations in demand, 
interruptions in the supply chains, and regular machine maintenance.

Abstract 
The Russo-Ukrainian War, which erupted on 24 February 2022, prompted over 6 million internally displaced people 
(IDPs) within the first month. Forced to flee to other oblasts, the IDPs faced shortages of shelter, food, and medical care. 
Purpose: This study aims to analyze the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity of in-kind humanitarian aid dona- tions to 
Ukraine during the crisis, identifying critical bottlenecks causing delays and scarcities in relief item delivery. 
Methodology: A mixed-methods approach is employed, combining quantitative analysis of border crossing data and aid 
distribution patterns with qualitative case studies of specific aid operations. Social media data is analyzed to assess donor 
preferences and media influence. Findings: Border crossing inefficiencies significantly impact aid delivery, with wait 
times up to six days. Mismatches between supplied items and actual needs compromise effectiveness, par- ticularly in 
medicine, fuel, and winterization supplies. Media visibility influences donor preferences, often leading to inequitable 
aid distribution. Decentralized postal systems show promise in mitigating some challenges, while cen- tralized 
transportation proves superior for diverse item delivery. Originality: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of 
in-kind donation logistics in a complex, ongoing crisis, offering insights into the interplay between efficiency, 
effectiveness, and equity in humanitarian aid. Practical implications: Recommendations include optimizing border 
crossing procedures, balancing donor preferences with actual needs, and leveraging a mix of centralized and decentralized 
distribution methods to enhance aid delivery in conflict zones.

Abstract 
Sleep habits greatly determine the productivity of call center agents. Night shift workers with poor sleep habits are 
mostly likely to be prone to developing depression and health issues. This study investigates factors affecting the sleep 
quality of night shift call center agents in Quezon City, Philippines. Data was collected from 474 respondents using 
the Pittsburgh Sleep Index and REBA analysis, with purposive sampling. The research shows that poor ergonomics 
and sleep habits negatively impact agents' physical health and sleep quality. Most agents sleep between 7-9 a.m. or 4-
6 a.m., with many facing sleep difficulties, frequent wake-up disturbances, body problems, and the environment. 
Despite these challenges, 45.8% rate their sleep quality as high. The study provides insights for further research on 
sleep and sleeping habits among night shift workers. Postural habits of the night shift worker greatly impact which 
mostly results in a high risk and needs to be addressed properly. Furthermore, the cognitive and physical ergonomics 
of the call center agents result in a lack of quality sleep. This study will serve as a guide for further research which 
contains information about sleep and sleeping habits.

Introduction 
Sleep is a critical factor for health and productivity, significantly impacting physical, social, emotional, mental, and 
financial well-being (Antonio & Hassan 2023). According to Liu and Jia (2023), shift work, especially night shifts, 
heightens the risk of depression, even for those with good sleep habits. Call centers, integral to the BPO industry, 
often require 24/7 availability, leading to rotating shifts that disrupt employees' health (Aiswarya & Kinslin 2019; 
Santos et al. 2023). Graveyard shifts, in particular, pose severe health risks, including mental health disorders (Kazemi 
et al.2019; Kansal 2019). The negative impact of such shifts on occupational health is similar to that observed in 
nursing and other night-shift jobs (Etindele-Sosso 2020). 
Night shift workers are at a higher risk of workplace accidents, cardiovascular diseases, depression, sleep disorders, 
and certain cancers, prompting the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to classify shift work as a 
potential human carcinogen (Lee et al. 2021). Moreover, the decline in average sleep duration over the past century,

Abstract 
The quantity of food waste consistently rises annually, which generates a large number from the household level. 
Therefore, it is imperative to engage in collaboration with all stakeholders to effectively mitigate food waste. Food 
banks appear to be potential actors in reducing food waste by distributing surplus food. Unfortunately, food banks as 
non-profit organizations rely significantly on donors for their operations. As a result, research on food banks' impact 
on the decreased amount of food waste needs to be conducted. This study used Partial Least Squares Structural 
Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the responses of 400 respondents in West Java to understand what factors 
motivated the public to donate and to generate recommendations for strategies to attract people to donate. This study 
considers factors such as personal norms, food waste behavior, personal experience toward poverty, and external 
motivation correlated to donation behavior. Based on the PLS-SEM result, unfortunately, there is no significant 
correlation between food waste behavior and donation behavior. Food waste at the household level is a multifaceted 
issue that can be influenced by various factors. Based on the recommendation result, it recommends further boosting 
public awareness by increasing through social media which aligns with the questionnaire result where almost 50% of 
respondents know food banks from social media.

Introduction 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are global action plans developed by the United Nations and expected to be 
achieved by 2030 to transform the world into a more sustainable one gets more attention recently. One of the SDGs 
promoted by the UN is zero hunger, which aims to put an end to hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and 
promote sustainable agriculture (Blesh et al. 2019). According to the findings of the Global Hunger Index 2022 
Indonesia has been placed as the third most severely affected country in terms of hunger within the ASEAN  (Annur, 
2023). Food security has become a significant national priority for the Indonesian government due to its complex 
nature and the inability of certain provinces to satisfy the minimum calorie intake (Devi et al. 2020; Makbul et al. 
2019; Mintarja 2019). As a result, ensuring the continuity of sustainable food security is a crucial factor in fostering

Abstract 
The Philippines is one of the largest exporters of shoes in the market. Shoe manufacturing companies are distributed 
throughout the country, with a significant base in Marikina City (Making the Philippine Footwear Industry Future 
Ready FINEX 2023). This study focuses on enhancing the productivity and efficiency of a shoe manufacturing 
company through the application of queuing theory. The upper-making section, being the largest and most complex 
part of the company, frequently encounters significant product queuing due to various issues such as unproductivity 
and inefficiency, leading to delays and production defects. The study aims to boost company productivity through 
queuing theory and improve worker performance in the upper-making section. Various analytical tools were utilized 
to identify problems and develop solutions. MATLAB simulations revealed that the average processing time for a unit 
in the current system is 219.5129-time units, while the proposed system reduces this to 69.7298-time units. 
Additionally, the waiting time in the queue decreased from 93.9226 to 7.3584-time units, demonstrating that the 
proposed simulation would significantly enhance productivity. The study recommends several solutions, including 
worker training, workplace organization, and improvements to the company's production cycle, to enhance 
productivity and efficiency, reduce delays, and improve product quality.

1. Introduction
Having a good quality important as the comfort of the feet can affect the health of the people. unsuitable and 
uncomfortable shoes are usually not considered because of the looks of the shoes that the person or the customer likes 
(Shoe Advisor Editorial Staff and Shoe Advisor Editorial Staff Writer 2021). In managing waiting time in a company, 
the number of materials or customers should be determined and how the mechanics of the service works in the system. 
Creating a proper system for the company is important to ensure the formal flow of queue customers or the materials 
that would increase the time of productivity of the company. Addressing an accurate waiting time will ensure the 
efficiency of the workers (Dag 2023).

Abstract 
Every company struggles to manage frequent, inevitable problems such as delays, resource allocation, and strategies 
intended for profitability and operational efficiency. The study utilized goal programming techniques, employing 
MATLAB software, to solve manufacturing company problems. The objectives were to determine the daily quota for 
Design 1, minimize processing hours in the coloring, packing, and sewing departments, and achieve the profit per 
piece of hat daily. The proposed approach for operations and profit improvements in the hat industry using multiple-
goal programming aids in achieving the company’s present goals. The application of goal programming techniques is 
crucial in identifying solutions for department-specific goals in three operations and profit outcomes, ultimately 
benefiting the hat manufacturing company. The results demonstrate success through a 25% machine efficiency and a 
quota increase to 154, which is a 2% improvement over the existing method. These goals were achieved through data 
analysis, constraint formulation, and MATLAB-based goal programming. To generate developing research and 
implement methodologies to address current issues observed in industries, future studies are recommended. Numerical 
analysis can be applied to study patterns and trends in the marketing world, helping define data from the target 
population, develop models that summarize insights, and incorporate these into strategies to improve company 
processes and eliminate overtime analysis.

Introduction 
The emergence of divergent problems in companies was evident in every business-related entity. Addressing the 
challenges faced by distinct organizations in terms of processes, profitability, minimization, maximization, delays, 
and more using operations research allowed companies to solve escalating dilemmas. Several methods were used to 
solve different types of organizational problems; operations research broadened the aspects of solving problems in 
various fields, including governmental, commercial, and industrial systems (Holstein et al. 2024). The purpose of 
operations research was to provide possible solutions to decisions, analyze data, utilize different software to solve 
problems, apply all considerations to possible solutions, and anticipate predictable and unpredictable instances such 
as risk and weak company strategies. It offered ways for organizations to enhance overall strategies in solving issues

1. Increase Profit.  
The study will increase profit by implementing marketing strategies, expanding market reach, enhancing operational 
efficiency, and optimizing sales. This led to a 0.64% daily profit increase for the hat manufacturing company, aligning 
with Bi et al. (2022), which reported a 3.25% profitability increase through optimization, demonstrating these 
strategies' effectiveness. 
 
2. Implement New Machine. The study will increase the quota from 150 to 154 units, a 2.63% increase, to enhance 
productivity and profitability. This adjustment is based on the need to meet quotas, which improves efficiency by 
producing more with the same or fewer resources. Achieving these quotas is crucial in the manufacturing industry for 
driving revenue, supporting organizational growth and maximizing employee performance (Aguilera et al. 2023).  
 
3. Minimize Delay. Implementing a cotton pad batch dyeing machine will enhance productivity by reducing the dyeing 
process time of 15-25%, compared to traditional methods (Singh and Verma 2017). This efficiency gain allows for 
faster production cycles, increasing hat output and overall productivity. The machine’s suitability for open-width 
fabric and its ability to maintain consistent production rates will improve yield and product quality, positively 
impacting profitability while supporting the existing workforce. 
4. Improve Workers Productivity. The study will improve productivity by focusing on working with effective time 
management, making a conducive environment, employee engagement and motivation, and technology and 
productivity tools. Implementing these strategies will create a positive domino effect, enhancing overall hat 
manufacturing productivity (Padhi 2022). 
  
5. Training and Retraining for Workers. The study will enhance productivity by recommending comprehensive 
training and retraining for workers. This includes Compliance and Safety Training, Lean Manufacturing Training, 
Quality Control Training, and Technical Skills Training. As noted by Smith (2022), these training programs are 
associated with increased productivity by enabling workers to better meet organizational goals and improve 
manufacturing processes. 
 
5.3 Limitations and Future Research 
The limitations of this study, focused on exploring the company's three major operations which is the coloring, 
packing, and sewing, the inclusion of all of the steps will generate more improvement in the company, which shows 
that integrating all several tools and techniques is limited, the prioritization of a much bigger problem in the company 
such as cost, salary and company arrangement can be further explored, aiming to solve the overall manufacturing 
problems. Further study will help this case study to improve the proposed solutions and give a broader interpretation 
of the company problems, in which the enhancement of production quotas, productivity, and profitability will be 
achieved in a more efficient way that will allow the company to achieve every goal.

Abstract 
Cleaning of foulants with enzymes has been considered more environmentally friendly compared to alkali cleaning. 
Cellulase was used to clean coconut milk foulants but the cleaning had to be done in two stages: cleaning by a 
surfactant followed by the enzyme. To simplify the enzymatic cleaning of coconut milk foulants, this work aimed to 
study effects of types of cellulase enzymes used on the cleaning efficiency. In addition, the work aimed to explore 
valuable components found in enzymatic cleaning effluents. Moreover, properties of the effluents, namely, TS, TSS, 
TDS, COD and pH were studied. The effluents from enzymatic cleaning had smaller TSS but significantly larger TS, 
TDS and COD compared to that from the cleaning using sodium hydroxide. However, the effluent from the cleaning 
by sodium hydroxide may be more difficult to treat, particularly when considering the pH of the effluent that was as 
high as pH 13. It was also discovered that all enzymatic cleaning effluents contained coconut oil, which could account 
for the high organic compounds in the effluents.

Introduction  
Coconut milk is a major food ingredient in Southeast Asia. Pasteurization of coconut milk is one process in coconut 
milk processing. During the pasteurization, coconut milk fouling, which is the accumulation of unwanted deposits on 
heat transfer surfaces, occurs. Issues with fouling include reduction of heat transfer, increased energy consumption, 
costs involved in cleaning, and possible contamination of the product. Cleaning costs do not only involve costs of 
chemicals, energy, and water used during the cleaning but also include loss of production during the cleaning 
downtime. Hence, an efficient cleaning method of foulants is vital. Coconut milk foulants is typically cleaned by alkali 
(sodium hydroxide: NaOH). NaOH is efficient in cleaning coconut milk foulants and cheap. However, wastewater of 
alkali cleaning is not environmentally friendly (Paul et al. 2014, Guerrero-Navarro et al. 2022). Recently, it has been 
shown that Cleaning-in-Place (CIP) of coconut milk foulants can be done by 2-staged cleaning using a surfactant 
followed by cellulase (Chutrakul et al.  2019). The cleaning efficiency was comparable to that obtained using NaOH. 
As the surfactant and the enzyme used in the work were biodegradable, the 2-staged cleaning proposed was claimed 
to be environmentally friendly. However, the properties of the cleaning effluents were not studied.  
As cellulase cleaned the foulants via digestion of the foulants (Chutrakul et al.  2019), there could also be valuable 
components in the cleaning effluent, e.g., oil and proteins, which could be made into useful byproducts.

The presence of fat was observed before when the effluent was measured for plant hormones and this fat could dissolve 
in the effluent due to the emulsifying property of the effluent. It should also be noted that due to the emulsifying 
property of the enzymatic cleaning effluent, it was not possible to centrifuge to separate the fat out before the 
measurement of TS. 
 
The larger value of COD observed with the enzymatic cleaning effluent was not unexpected as there would be more 
organic compounds, e.g. fat, protein and polysaccharides, in the enzymatic cleaning effluent than in the alkali cleaning 
effluent. However, it might be more difficult to treat the alkali cleaning effluent due to its high pH and a large amount 
of inorganic salts. The latter was reported to cause high salt load on the environment affecting aquatic life (Grasshoff, 
2002; Paul et al. 2014). If the organic compounds found in the enzymatic cleaning effluent are removed to make useful 
products, COD of the effluent could also be lowered. Further work should be conducted to explore this possibility. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The two cellulase types, Cellic® Ctec2 and Celluclast® gave similar cleaning efficiencies. However, they resulted in 
different compounds in the effluents. Sugar was found when Cellic® Ctec2 was used whereas polysaccharides were 
found with Celluclast®. From the results, polysaccharides could be used as an emulsifier. There was no plant hormones 
found in any effluents studied. However, the presence of phenolic compounds normally associated with VCO, was 
observed in all the enzymatic cleaning effluents. Since there have been reported several uses of polysaccharides and 
benefits of phenolic compounds found in VCO, the enzymatic effluent could be converted into useful products.  
 
Using a mixture of Celluclast® and Acalase gave the highest cleaning efficiency. Cleaning results also suggested the 
possibility of using a single stage using this mixture of enzymes to clean coconut milk foulants by increasing the 
cleaning fluid speed. Direction of flows could also play an important role in the cleaning efficiency; this work 
suggested that having various directions of shear forces could improve cleaning performance.  
 
Considering water properties of the effluent from the enzymatic cleaning (Celluclast® mixed with protease) and the 
effluent from the alkali cleaning, TS, TDS and COD of the enzymatic cleaning were larger. This could be due to the 
presence of coconut oil and polysaccharides in the enzymatic cleaning effluent. Hence, a method to remove the oil 
and/or polysaccharides from the effluent should be considered in the treatment of the water from the enzymatic 
cleaning effluent. Nevertheless, the lower pH and smaller concentrations of salts in the enzymatic cleaning effluent 
suggested that the effluent could be treated and could have less effects on the environment.

Abstract 
Internal resources are considered to be the foundation for the new venture’s survival. These resources act as a 
buffer against the liability of newness and smallness, resulting in sustained competitive advantage. Drawing upon 
the Resource-based view (RBV), the study investigated the combined effect of three major internal resources 
(human, social, and technological) on the survival of incubated startups. We tested our hypotheses on a sample of 
261 startups that were incubated at the Institute of National Importance incubation centers in India between 2012 
and 2020. The results of the binary logistic regression analysis found that internal resources such as the founders’ 
education, industry experience, entrepreneurial experience, social capital utilization, and startup offerings have a 
significant and positive effect on incubated startup survival. However, the availability of intellectual property 
rights (IPRs) and founders’ managerial experience have a negative impact on the survival and success of startups. 
Our results partially confirmed the significant role of the combined effect of internal resources on the survival and 
success of the startups.

1.Introduction
Startups have proliferated over the past few decades, driven by global innovation and disruptions (Khurana and 
Farhat 2021). These firms have a significant role in economic development by creating employment, driving 
innovation, and increasing healthy competition (Biru et al. 2021). Despite the potential benefits these firms 
provide, the survival rates of startups remain a significant challenge (Soto-Simeone et al. 2020). The extant 
research on startup survival has found that around 50-80% of young ventures fail to survive beyond five years, 
and only a small portion of startups, varying between 10 to 20%, manage to survive beyond a decade (Islam et al. 
2018). These high failure rates can be attributed to innovative startup offerings and the dynamic and competitive 
environment in which the startups operate (Stenholm and Renko 2016). Further, these fledging firms encounter 
several challenges during their life cycle that contribute to high failure rates, such as limited knowledge of the 
environment, information asymmetries, and a lack of competent workforce (Islam et al. 2018). The liabilities of 
newness and smallness, along with these challenges, increase the likelihood of failure for these fledging firms as 
they cannot withstand prolonged periods of poor performance (Lasrado et al. 2016).

social capital investments, presence of a spouse, number of IPRs, research and development activities, and offering 
products or services do not significantly affect startup survivability. Thus, the results partially confirmed the significant 
roles of the combined effect of internal on the survival and success of the startups. The study contributes to three key 
literature streams, namely startup survival, internal resources and academic incubated startups, by examining how 
selected internal resources, individually and collectively, shape the competitive landscape and influence the survival 
of university-incubated startups. 
 
The study has implications for practitioners such as entrepreneurs, incubator managers, and policymakers. 
Entrepreneurs whose startups are in the early stages should focus on resource allocation, diversification, and strategic 
optimization due to the limited availability of resources. The study’s findings suggest that they should prioritize 
diversification as a risk mitigation strategy during the initial stages, as a diversified resource portfolio acts as a safety 
net against unexpected environmental shocks and enhances the probability of early-stage survival. However, an 
optimization strategy should be undertaken by startups after careful assessment of internal resources to capitalize on 
underutilised resources for sustainable growth. Academic incubator managers should provide access to essential 
resources such as mentorship, funding, and infrastructure, which play a significant role in startup survival and growth. 
Policymakers have a significant role in shaping the country's entrepreneurial ecosystem because they provide a 
conducive environment for startups to innovate and prosper. They should give promising ventures based on novel 
ideas and strong business models access to resources such as funding, networking opportunities, and legal aid for 
intellectual protection. 
 
Although this study has significant implications, it is imperative to acknowledge its limitations. First, the dependent 
variable considered in the study is startup survival. However, different performance metrics, such as sales and 
employment growth, each with varying implications for a startup’s viability, can be used for measuring startup 
performance. Second, its modest sample size is a noteworthy limitation that can limit the generalizability of the study’s 
findings. Third, the study employed a quantitative approach to examine the relationship between internal resources 
and startup survival.

Abstract 
One of the primary challenges in the petrochemical supply chain is to secure high profits while considering 
environmental factors. This study employs Discrete Event Simulation using ARENA software to address profit 
maximization in the multi-echelon petrochemical supply chain by smartly controlling the inventory to minimize 
flaring and shortage events. The simulation has been developed based on a real case located in Saudi Arabia. The 
primary objective is to reconfigure the existing capacity constraints and operational strategies to achieve higher 
profitability and operational efficiency. Comparative results indicate a substantial enhancement in profitability with 
the implementation of our approach. The presented model demonstrates a significant increase in the profit by 2.99% 
and saves 0.428% emissions compared to the current system. This substantial enhancement underlines the 
effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategy within the simulation framework. The implications of this study 
are significant for the petrochemical industry, suggesting that considerable cost savings and efficiency gains are 
achievable with strategic modifications to supply chain management.

3.3 Optimization 
Based on the material balance constraint for this case and the objective of maximizing profit by avoiding shortage and 
reduce flaring cost. We consider the control of minimum recycle performance, the limit in the sphere to flare, and the 
amount of supply that can be seen in Table 5. To comprehend the system's potential results and behavior, we conduct 
the simulation model under 3 scenarios with supporting tools opt Quest.

In this study, we aim to achieve high profits while considering environmental factors, represented by flaring costs. 
For profit consideration, according to the results shown in opt Quest, the best solution will provide $27,648.87 per 
hour with a flaring cost of $567.667 per hour. This solution was achieved by changing the control variable for the 
limit to flare to 2,616 tons, recycling rates to 19 tons/hour, and receiving C2 11 MMCSF, C3 60 MBD, and NGL 50

Reducing the flare limit, contrary to expectations, may lead to more frequent flaring, increased flaring costs, and 
reduced profit. Although a lower flare limit can provide more space for storing resulting products during flaring events, 
it may also result in higher flaring costs and less efficient operation. In contrast, increasing the flare limit can reduce 
the space available for resulting products, potentially causing delays in their storage and resulting in unmet demand. 
This underscores the importance of carefully balancing the flare limit to optimize both operational efficiency and 
financial performance.  For environmental considerations, according to the Table 6, the best flaring cost is $564.127 
per hour with an hourly profit $27,318.46. In conclusion, there is a tradeoff between environmental effects and total 
profit secured. Hence, the top management should decide on the best configuration based on their priority and 
preferences.

5. Conclusion  
This study demonstrates the efficacy of simulation-based optimization in enhancing the profitability and operational 
efficiency of a multi-echelon petrochemical supply chain. Using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with ARENA 
software, we successfully addressed the challenge of balancing high profits with environmental considerations, 
achieving a notable 2.99% increase in profitability and a 0.428% reduction in emissions compared to the current 
system. The results from OptQuest indicate that the optimal solution provides $27,318.46 per hour in revenue with a 
flaring cost of $564.127 per hour, highlighting the effectiveness of strategic adjustments in capacity constraints and 
operational strategies. 
 
Adjusting the flare limit below the expected level may lead to increased flaring frequency, elevated flaring costs, and 
reduced profitability. While a lower flare limit offers more space for storing derivative products during flaring. On the 
other hand, if the flare limit is raised, less room will be available for the byproducts, which could lead to storage delays 
and unfulfilled demand. This highlights the significance of carefully adjusting the flare limit to maximize operational 
effectiveness and financial results.  The presented optimization strategy, utilizing DES and ARENA, offers significant 
insights and practical implications for improving petrochemical supply chain management.

Abstract 
The year 2023 is confirmed as the hottest calendar year in global temperature data records since 1850. One of the 
causes of global warming is the production of carbon emissions. To promote a low-carbon future globally, the Paris 
Agreement was adopted on December 12, 2015, and signed by all countries. Indonesia is one of the countries with a 
large energy reduction target of 30-41%. One of the challenges to realize this is Indonesia's large energy demand, 
which is one of the largest emission-contributing sectors. Through PLN's long-term plan, Indonesia targets a large 
increase in the number of hydropower plants until 2030 as one of the best energy source options. One of the 
breakthroughs made is the use of pumped storage hydropower plants. However, pumped storage hydropower plants 
are new in Indonesia and the investment value to build pumped storage hydropower plants is very large. With various 
uncertainty or risk factors from the financial aspect, a study is needed that further assesses the financial feasibility of 
building a pumped storage hydropower plants by considering factors. Based on the research results, it is found that 3 
risk factors can affect the financial feasibility of pumped hydropower development, namely selling price, investment 
cost, and operational and maintenance cost.

Introduction 
The year 2023 was recorded as the hottest year in global temperature records since 1850, with the global average 
temperature reaching 14.98°C (Copernicus Climate Change Service  2024). This temperature increase had significant 
impacts, particularly on sea ice in Antarctica and the Arctic, as shown in Figure 1. The extent of Antarctic sea ice 
reached a record low with an average of 3.79 million square miles, while Arctic sea ice coverage was among the 10 
lowest years on record (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2024).

To further validate the findings, results are compared with similar studies in other emerging markets. While the 
specific numbers differ due to local conditions, the general trend of pumped-storage hydro projects requiring 
significant price support aligns with experiences in countries like India and Brazil. This international comparison 
provides additional confidence in the overall direction of the findings, even if the specific values are unique to the 
Indonesian context. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Through discounted cash flow analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, this study examined two operational scenarios 
under various uncertainty factors for the evaluation of the financial feasibility of pumped storage hydropower plants 
in Indonesia, focusing on a proposed site in West Java. Key uncertainty factors influencing financial feasibility were 
identified as PLN's electricity purchase price, capital expenditure, and operational and maintenance costs. To achieve 
financial viability, the analysis suggests that electricity purchase prices would need to be set at Rp2,903 and Rp4,666 
for the first and second scenarios, respectively. This research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in Indonesia's 
energy sector. However, we acknowledge the limitations of our study and recommend future research to incorporate 
broader socio-environmental factors and a wider range of uncertainty variables. Additionally, the findings can serve 
as a foundation for developing risk management strategies and informing government policies on renewable energy 
support schemes.

Abstract 
This study aims to develop the Ozone generator-controlling system for sterilization in In-Patient room. Nowadays, 
there are many methods that the hospital uses for sterilizing the In-Patient room such as ultraviolet light, manual 
cleaning and disinfection, hydrogen peroxide vapor, and Ozone sterilization. Using ozone sterilization is one of the 
most effective ways. However, after the ozone is generated by the ozone generator, it is difficult to maintain the 
concentration of the ozone in the air, especially, the ozone concentration levels that each generator produces. 
Therefore, developing the ozone controlling system by using sensors to indicate the level of ozone concentration can 
accurately control the amount of ozone generated. Under the circumstances of Industry 4.0, the controlling system 
was digitalizing developed by Raspberry pi. The system was validated in the real experiments by monitoring the 
amount of ozone concentration in parts per million units which are controlled by the Ozone controlling system. 
Ultimately, it innovates the better sterilization method for the hospital In-Patient room.

Abstract 
In past decades, a multitude of event related to supply chain disruption (e.g., the earthquake in Japan 2011, global 
economic crises in 2011, and current Covid19 case) have occurred in succession, causing greats loses to enterprise or 
even the national scale. Seaport, under global economic and supply chain integration, is also vulnerable on this event 
and sometime generating a domino effect to the entire supply chain network. The vulnerability of seaport thus needs 
to be addressed to ensure the functionality of seaport and enhance supply chain resilience. The primary goal of this 
study is to develop a framework that can be useful to understand: the phenomena of interdependency of the conditional 
risk in the seaports; and risk appetite from their entities too. This study investigated Indonesian seaport operation 
related the supply chain disruption. In realization, this research started with observing the extensive literature review 
and risk document related supply chain disruption from the Indonesian seaport. Furthermore, this research finds that 
there are 10 dimensional threats factors and 61 seaport risk factors that have clear implication to disrupt supply chain 
continuity – not only Indonesia but also somewhere seaport.

analysis, and mix-integer linear programming. 
1. Introduction
In a term of efficiency and effectiveness, the concepts of leanness and agility within the seaport context is employed 
by Paixao and Marlow (2003). This integration may be performed through the use of communication technology for 
information exchange, in along with integrating value-added activities and cost-saving measures. A seamlessly 
integrated seaport in the supply chain is distinguished by effective communication, waste elimination, operational cost 
reduction (e.g., through Just-in-Time practices), interconnectivity and interoperability of modal infrastructure, and the 
provision of value-added services leading to increased customer satisfaction. 
Furthermore, seaports have evolved from being standalone nodes into integrated supply chain service centers, 
departing from their traditional roles as transportation or distribution hubs. Some major seaport enterprises in certain 
countries now aim to enhance the seaport supply chain through both horizontal and vertical integration. The heightened 
significance of seaports exposes them as vulnerable nodes, as disruptions in one seaport can trigger a cascading effect 
throughout a network of supply chains. Notable instances include the giant ship blocking the Suez Canal in Egypt in

6. Conclusion 
First study – We computed the correlation network by calculating the dependency degree using rough set and genetic 
algorithm. The correlation network is addressed to reveal the interdependency between the supply chain threat factors 
(threat variables) with their risk event (conditional seaport risk as observable attributes). According to the study 
findings, 24 seaport risks in Indonesia pose potential threats to supply chain continuity.  
Second study – It was found the seaport service process should be optimized as a priority in order to reduce the 
disruption. The factor disrupts utility by as much as 32%, followed by the relationship process threat (A5) and planning 
process threat (A1). Hence, these latter two threats assume the second and third priorities, respectively. However, the 
infrastructure breakdown (A2) poses less threat of SSCRD at 9.9%. Moreover, the conditional seaport risk attributes 
significantly contribute to SSCRD and make the conditional seaport risk attributes more unpredictable. As regards the 
advantage related to the level of risk, the highest level of SSCR attributes is maintained at the utility level of 1%-37%. 
Unless the SSC utility of earthquake (a101) is zero for the first time, in the robustness test in Figure 5. It means that the 
utility this factor is 0 in its first occurrence. This negative trend points out that SSC entities must simultaneously focus 
on planning, implementation, and development directed toward enhancing SSC resilience.  
Third study – It introduces the concept of interdependency among the conditional seaport risk attributes and evaluate 
them according to the rough set parameter, such as certainty and coverage. Moreover, the MANOVA was used to 
check whether the dependent variables from the reduction algorithm have similar matrix correlations (variance–
covariance) with the predictor features. As results, there are 16 features are considered to pose the highest potential 
risk to SSC continuity in Figure 6. The scale in the legend indicates the correlation referring to the interdependency 
and implication degrees.  
Fourth study– This study explaining about risk appetite model. Risk appetite of the SSC stakeholders drives the 
tolerance level with respect to the acceptance of risks. Using mix-integer linear programming (MILP), we selected the 
risk factors that have minimum tolerance level with regards to the risk acceptance. The minimum acceptance risk level 
helped to minimize the revenue loss; hence, we got a comprehensive understanding which conditional seaport risk 
that useful to minimize revenue loss and how far the revenue loss can be minimized. By this, we also computed the 
minimizing revenue loss problem considering two rules or scenarios, such as sporadic risk case and repetitive risk 
case. As a result, the potential revenue loss for the port-authority is 8.67% and followed by 7.12% of seaport-user in 
the sporadic case. Whereas 19% and 17% of the potential revenue loss from port-authority and seaport-user 
respectively is impacted from the repetitive risk case. 
In general, the supply chain operation should not be focused on the manufacturing perspective. The integration of the 
seaport should be considered in the supply chain network. Thus, the SSC operations should focus on optimizing cost, 
profit, and capacity. In fact, the discrepancy can be observed in real-life operations where minimizing revenue loss 
becomes a significant objective when the risk event occurred. In this dissertation, it has developed three model to 
understand the interdependency phenomena, such as supply chain threat with conditional seaport risk, conditional

seaport risk with conditional seaport risk, conditional seaport risk with profit loss referring the risk-appetite of 
decision-makers. The first and the second study has developed combinatorial optimization problem to reveal the 
central tendency of conditional seaport risk and which supply chain threat are significant in Indonesia context. 
Similarly, in the third study endogenous and exogenous relation is presented to understand the interdependency among 
the conditional seaport risk attributes. While the implication from supply chain threat and conditional seaport risk 
attributes toward the potential profit loss were calculated using risk appetite model in the fourth study.

Abstract 
In the production process of virgin coconut oil (VCO), by-products like coconut residue are underutilized. The residue 
is either used as an animal feed or roasted to give cooking coconut oil. However, the inactivated by the heat during 
the roasting. Therefore, this research aimed to study the effect of antioxidants of the oil were pretreating coconut meat 
with enzymes on the oil yield in order to maximize the yield. Cellulase enzymes (500, 1500, 35000, 44000, and 50000 
U/ 20 g coconut meat) were used to pretreat coconut meat. Comparing oil yields obtained with the enzyme 
pretreatment and without one, it was found that enzyme pretreatment increased the oil yield but the amount of enzyme 
within the range studied had little effect on the oil yield. However, increasing the amount of enzyme decreased 
polysaccharides content in the water phase. It could be concluded that the enzyme pretreatment could improve VCO 
extraction and reduce oil remaining in coconut residue. Moreover, additional byproducts, e.g., polysaccharides, could 
be obtained.

Introduction 
Coconut residue is a by-product of the production of virgin coconut oil (VCO). It has been reported that oil remained 
in the coconut residue (Yalegama et al. 2013). In present, the coconut residue is roasted (heating process) to obtain oil 
but this oil has no antioxidant activity. Enzymes has been reported to assist oil extraction to produce VCO (Che Man 
et al. 1996). Hence, this work aimed to study the effects of treating coconut meat with cellulase on oil yield.  
1.1 Objective  
To investigate the effects of treating coconut meat with cellulase on oil yields without modifying the VCO process. 
2. Literature Review
VCO production process is an oil extraction from fresh coconut meat that does not require high temperature or involve 
chemical extraction; VCO has been reported to have higher antioxidant activity than the Refined, Bleached and 
Deodorized Coconut Oil (RBD oil) (Negi et al. 2024). VCO is clear and colorless and has a coconut aroma and taste 
(Wickramasinghe et al. 2023). There are several wet processes for extracting oil from coconut meat to produce VCO, 
such as the traditional hand-pressed, fermentation, centrifugation, and enzyme process. (Figure 1.)

5. Conclusion
The present study indicated that pretreating coconut meat with cellulase could improve VCO extraction by increasing 
the oil yield. We found that increasing cellulase enhanced oil extraction but decreased polysaccharides content. Hence, 
to utilize the polysaccharides without sacrificing the oil yield, around 35000-44000 U of cellulase would be 
appropriate for the enzyme pretreatment.

Abstract 
Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more popular and necessary in this age as a means of mobility due to their 
positive impact on the environment and resource use efficiency. More nations worldwide are advocating the use of 
EV. An interesting problem regarding the use of EVs is the selection of a charging station that satisfies several 
objectives that are relevant to vehicle users. In this paper, a rule-based system derived from Artificial Intelligence and 
the Analytic Hierarchical Process are integrated to address this challenging problem.  The rule-based system is for 
ensuring feasibility and the AHP is for optimal selection. The integrated approach is implemented using Python and 
its applicability is demonstrated using a case study.

1. Introduction
Vehicles that rely on fuel are a significant contributor to the emission of greenhouse gases. To promote environmental 
conservation and resource efficiency, nations worldwide are actively advocating for the protection of the environment 
and endorsing the advancement of electric vehicle businesses, consequently leading to the increasing adoption of 
electric vehicles. A range of issues have arisen due to the slower progress of supporting service industries for electric 
vehicles, particularly charging, in comparison to the continuous advancement of the electric vehicle industry.

It is important to note that the input parameters have a significant impact on the selection results, so the system 
models should be calculated carefully. From table 8, Chevy spark has only one feasible CS and the system will select 
that CS directly without using AHP. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The selection of a charging station for EV charging is a challenging optimization problem. The problem has many 
attributes that contribute to the challenge. The attributes include the competition between the vehicle’s users, the 
objectives of the uses for the selection and the many constraints that are part of this problem. The criteria of the users 
include the total response time (which includes travel time, waiting time at the charging station, and charging time), 
battery degradation, price and energy. To address the problem and its challenges two methods are developed and 
integrated. The first method is a rule-based system drawn from artificial intelligence and the second is AHP from 
multi-criteria decision making. The rule-based systems ensure feasibility and the AHP facilitates the decision-making 
process in a multi-criteria environment. The integrated methods are implemented in Python and tested on a case study. 
The results are promising. Further research is needed to test the developed approach a well-designed computational 
study reflecting the real-world environment that users encounter.

Abstract 
Increasingly, people leading healthy lifestyles engage in regular exercise to stay in shape and require protein 
supplements to gain muscle mass. Currently, there are few products that provide high levels of protein. This research 
proposes the development of a prototype protein bar that achieves a higher protein value than the supplements 
available on the market. To determine the number of trials, the design of experiments was used, employing the 22 
factorial design, with mixtures obtained through the Simplex-Centroid mixture design. Protein analysis was performed 
using the Kjeldahl method. The results show that the formulation with the highest protein content includes 45% soy 
and 35% quinoa, achieving 20.94% protein, which translates to 21.15 grams of protein per 101-gram serving. 
Additionally, a comparison was made with products available on the Peruvian market, yielding 41% more protein per 
serving at a price 34.84% cheaper. Sensory results indicate a good texture and aroma of the product, with taste and 
appearance having opportunities for improvement. The research concludes that the protein bar is nutritious and 
accessible to consumers.

Introduction 
In recent years, awareness of health and physical well-being has increased, along with the trend toward consuming 
organic products (Iuliano et al. 2019). This shift has led to a rise in fitness enthusiasts, where diet plays the most 
crucial role in achieving physical transformation. Whether an individual’s goal is to increase muscle mass through a 
caloric surplus (consuming more calories than the body expends during the day) or to lose fat through a caloric deficit 
(consuming fewer calories than the body needs) (Thom and Lean 2017), diet is a fundamental factor in both scenarios. 
However, high-protein diets can be heavy and costly, prompting some people to incorporate supplements into their 
diets.  Not only do individuals who train require proteins in their daily diet, but everyone needs to meet a daily protein 
requirement. Men between the ages of 25 and 50 should consume 63 grams of protein per day, and women should 
consume 50 grams per day (Clínica Universidad de Navarra, n.d.).Cereal bars are practical, easy to produce, and can 
be sold at a low price depending on the ingredients used (Lobato et al. 2011). The change in consumers lifestyles 
promotes the commercialization of ""on-the-go"" foods, such as cereal bars (Boukid et al. 2022). This is why the product 
is presented in the form of a cereal bar.

vegan consumers, thereby expanding the potential market. Environmentally and health-conscious consumers are 
currently seeking plant-based alternatives to replace animal products in their daily diets (Peng et al. 2023). Another 
binding option is hydrolyzed collagen, which would reduce the amount of sugar present in the bar (Palacio 2023). 
This would be beneficial since it is important for consumers that cereal bars have low sugar content (Kosicka-Gębska 
et al. 2024). 
 
It is also recommended to control the baking temperature of the bars, preferably cooking them at low temperatures for 
a longer duration. Since they are made with soy flour, they tend to burn easily. According to the reviewed research, 
the optimal temperature range is between 60°C and 120°C. 
 
A comparison with some protein bars available in the Peruvian market is presented below. The prototype bar contains 
41% more protein per serving compared to the first one, at a price that is 34.84% lower. In comparison with the second 
bar, which contains 10 grams of protein per serving, the prototype contains 111.5% more protein at a price that is 20% 
lower.

5.4 Validation  
A prototype protein bar was successfully manufactured using ingredients native to Peru, such as quinoa, along with 
soy, honey, peanuts, raisins, and cinnamon powder, achieving high protein values. To demonstrate this, the Kjeldahl 
method was used. This method is the historical reference method for protein determination and is used for the 
validation of alternative methods (Lynch & Barbano, 1999). For validation, the formula presented earlier is used with 
the data collected during experimentation, as shown below: 
 
(6,5 −1)x0,04x14,01
0,092𝑥𝑥10
𝑥𝑥6.25 = 20,94% 
 
Using this method, the protein percentage present in the prototype was validated, which is 20.94% of the weight. For 
a portion weighing 101 grams, this equates to 20.15 grams of protein per serving. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this research, four prototypes of protein bars were developed and manufactured using soy, quinoa, peanuts, raisins, 
cinnamon, and honey, with the first two being the main ingredients. The results of the conducted trials show that the 
formulation with the highest protein content includes 45 grams of soy, 35 grams of quinoa, 10 grams of honey, 5 
grams of raisins, 5 grams of peanuts, and 1 gram of cinnamon powder. The final product weighed 101 grams and 
contained 21.15 grams of protein, providing a substantial amount of protein per serving. The texture and aroma of the 
bar are the product's strengths, with the dehydration of quinoa contributing to a good crunch, while honey and 
cinnamon powder provide a pleasant aroma. There is still room for improvement in the appearance and flavor of the 
bar. 
 
It is important to emphasize that this prototype was developed in a functional foods laboratory on a small scale, where 
operations such as mixing and molding were done manually. The development was also limited to using the previously 
mentioned ingredients, and no tests were conducted with different foods. However, there is the potential to enhance 
the nutritional value of the prototype by implementing or replacing some ingredients, especially those used to bind 
the mixture. In terms of testing, the protein analysis was limited to the Kjeldahl method in the Functional Foods 
Laboratory at the University of Lima, and the nutritional value tests were conducted at the SAT Peru laboratory. 
On the other hand, it is possible to scale production to an industrial level since the production process is simple and 
does not require many steps. The most complex part is the mixing of ingredients, which can be addressed with a high-
quality mixing machine.

Abstract 
This study aims to develop a real-time mobile application-based production line balancing tool for export garment 
factories in Thailand, addressing the challenges posed by significant market demand. Thailand’s garment factories 
export OEM sportswear outfits to Europe, America, and Japan, adapting products to meet ever-changing fashion 
trends. Consequently, production and delivery times are significantly shorter than traditional seasonal fashion cycles. 
Making changes to color and sizing throughout the season puts even tighter constraints on production schedules. 
Therefore, the manufacturer that can most swiftly adapt to fluctuating demands for the combination of colors, sizes, 
and styles will capture the largest market share. The case study of sport ware outfit manufacturer is considered. The 
plant is experiencing decreased productivity resulting from suboptimal line configurations and the ongoing learning 
curve of the workforce. Overloaded tasks or worker skill gaps can create bottlenecks that slow down overall 
production. The engineering team conducted an analysis to pinpoint the specific process or resource causing the 
production slowdown. This analysis involved a line-balancing process using stopwatch timing and spreadsheet 
calculations to determine the time consumption of each process step. The results were visualized in a bar graph format 
known as a Yamazumi chart. Subsequently, reducing the total time represented by all bars in the Yamazumi chart is 
necessary to achieve the desired overall time reduction. To replace manual stopwatches and spreadsheet-based line 
balancing, we developed a digital mobile tool equipped with an algorithm for automated line balancing analysis. Our 
real-time mobile tool drastically reduces line balancing operation time from four hours to under ten minutes. 
Bottleneck elimination resulted in a substantial boost to production efficiency, increasing it from 70.4% to 76.3%. 
This represents a notable 5.9% improvement.

1. Introduction
The ready-made garment industry for export from Thailand is worth tens of billions of baht. is about to face 
uncertainties resulting from the global market. These uncertainties stem from both economic conditions and climatic 
factors that can cause damage to the clothing industry. Challenges arise in terms of raw materials and supply chains. 
Additionally, changing fashion trends influenced by an increase in global tourism or the impact of new-age influencers 
from online communities may make outdoor fashion more popular. However, intense competition among leading 
brands will accelerate the growth of Fast Fashion, favoring those who can quickly adapt to consumer demands. This 
inevitably affects the supply chain. The garment factory plays a crucial role in responding to the ever-changing 
demands and requirements of the ready-made fashion industry. One key criterion for measuring responsiveness to 
change is the total time in production, known as the Production Lead Time. This time is further subdivided into Takt 
time, which represents the time per completed garment, and Cycle Time, which accounts for the time spent at each 
production step. Given that garment production involves numerous steps (typically averaging 20-40), it’s essential to 
balance and align work methods across these stages. This ensures smooth operations and avoids bottlenecks, which 
are points where work slows down significantly. To identify bottlenecks, the Yamazumi Chart is a valuable tool. It 
graphically displays the Cycle Time for each production process as a bar graph, allowing clear comparisons. By 
adjusting processes based on this data, we can optimize production toward a Lean approach. To balance workload and

5. Conclusions 
To address the increasing need for high productivity, short lead time, and rapid market response, a line balancing tool 
accessible via mobile and web applications has been tested and deployed in a Thai garment factory. Transitioning 
from manual paperwork to digital processes necessitates a financial outlay. However, this investment is justifiable 
given the potential for increased productivity, as evidenced by 5.9% improvement in the test case. Moreover, ongoing 
efforts to identify and eliminate bottlenecks represent a significant opportunity to enhance profitability.

Abstract 
Additive manufacturing (AM) also known as 3D printing led to a revolution in the manufacturing sector, as it 
shortened the time-to-market of new products, facilitated intricate design, and more importantly mass customization. 
One of the well-known AM processes is fused deposition modeling (FDM) which can create polymer-based parts. 
The restricted size of printed part is a major problem in FDM due to its limited chamber size. The oversized model 
issue was addressed by some researchers, proposing the segmentation and division of large models as a solution for 
this problem. This study aims to investigate the effect of flat dovetail and round screw joints as segmental joining 
methods with the placement of cyanoacrylate adhesive between the polylactic acid (PLA) segments on the flexural 
strength of the final joined PLA parts. The results revealed that the use of cyanoacrylate adhesive significantly 
enhances the flexural strength of round screw joints in PLA prototypes, while it reduces the flexural strength of flat 
dovetail joints, with the positive impact on round screw joints being more pronounced.

1. Introduction
The FDM process is one of the AM techniques that produces polymeric components based on the addition of materials 
according to the layer-by-layer building principle as all AM technologies. layer-by-layer approach allows for the 
creation of complex geometries that would be difficult to manufacture using traditional subtractive methods. (Sai & 
Yeole, 2001; Mohamed et al. 2015). Polylactic acid (PLA) material is predominantly used for parts fabrication in 
FDM due to its distinguished properties which make it a suitable material for various applications (Farah et al. 2016a). 
The limited size of the FDM building chamber constitutes a significant challenge, which has a direct reflection on the 
restricted size of the printed part, especially if the desired design requires a large prototype. A segmentation of large-
scale models by dividing the whole model into printable small segments, considering the original geometry of the 
model can be a potential solution (Li & Peng 2020). The selection of joining techniques for the resulting segments is 
considered a key factor in determining the performance of the final part in real applications. Several joining methods 
can be proposed, including adhesive materials, mechanical assembly, and welding, each offering distinct advantages 
and suitability depending on the specific requirements of the application, such as environmental resistance, ease of 
assembly, and the need for disassembly or repair (Özenç et al. 2022). The decision regarding the selection of the 
suitable type of joining technique between segments depends on the application requirements that the final formed 
part will perform, including factors such as the required strength, durability, environmental exposure, thermal or

Figure 12. Interaction plot for flexural strength. 
Depending on figure 12, which represents the segmental joining method-cyanoacrylate adhesive usage interaction 
plot. The placement of cyanoacrylate adhesive significantly increased the flexural strength of round screw joints but 
decreased the flexural strength of flat dovetail joints. However, the positive effect of the adhesive on the flexural 
strength was more pronounced in round screw joints compared to the negative effect on flat dovetail joints, which is 
a strong indication that the effect of the cyanoacrylate adhesive usage on flexural strength depends on the type of used 
joint.  
6. Conclusion  
An experimental study has been carried out on a set of 3D-printed PLA segments to study the effect of segmental 
joining methods with and without cyanoacrylate adhesive on the mechanical behavior of different joining categories 
under flexural loading. The key findings from this study are as follows: 
The mechanical behavior of joined 3D-printed PLA segments under flexural loading is greatly affected by the joining 
method and the adhesive usage. 
 
The combination of round Screw Joints with cyanoacrylate adhesive significantly enhances the flexural strength of 
the final joined part. The use of cyanoacrylate adhesive for flat dovetail joints negatively impacts flexural strength. 
Therefore, the effectiveness of cyanoacrylate adhesive depends on the used segmental joining method. 
Overall, the study provides valuable information about the mechanical properties of joined 3D-PLA segments, 
highlighting the importance of choosing suitable bonding methods to achieve optimal mechanical performance for 
3D-printed structures.

Abstract 
This paper aims to establish whether there is any correlation between total quality management (TQM) and the triple 
bottom line (TBL), from the perspective of construction companies in Gauteng, South Africa. The objective of the 
paper is to determine the ways in which organizations can use TQM principles to aid the TBL and identify the gaps 
that are present in terms of achieving sustainable construction. The study follows a quantitative approach using a 
questionnaire assessing TQM elements (customer focus, Leadership, employee involvement, process approach, 
continuous improvement, evidence-based approach, and relationship management) and the TBL (economic, 
environmental, and social sustainability). With a response rate of 71%, the findings of the study revealed that there is 
a positive correlation between TQM and the TBL. The study’s recommendations can be used to show the impact of 
quality in driving sustainability from construction organizations perspective and to guide other organizations achieve 
their sustainability agenda.

1. Introduction
The fourth industrial revolution has made information easily accessible through technology and social media; the 
public has become more informed about what is happening in their environment, such as the depletion of natural 
resources, climate change, and the rise in air and water pollution. Consumers are also more mindful of the products 
and services that they consume or utilize. Sambo et al. (2022) note that this has altered consumer expectations and 
demands, encouraging them to choose high-quality goods or services from organizations that cause the least harm to 
the environment. 
Countries worldwide are on a goal to achieve sustainable development by 203, as indicated by Weiland et al. (2021), 
which has put immense pressure on industries to transition into more sustainable operations while still producing 
products and services of exceptional quality. Based on research, sustainability is the maintenance of resources for the 
next generations (Hashim et al. 2023). With global problems such as climate change and an increase in poverty, 
resources are not infinite but very scarce. Therefore, as concluded by Hashim et al. (2023), every industry needs to 
play its role in maintaining these resources to save our planet.  
The construction industry is a vital sector that encompasses manufacturing, trade, and various activities related to 
building, repairing, renovating, and maintaining infrastructure (Hussain et al. 2022). The transition to sustainable 
growth in the construction industry is crucial for a nation. Although the industry is one of the main drivers of

5. Conclusion 
The study aimed to investigate how Total Quality Management (TQM) and sustainable development are connected in 
the construction industry, particularly in Gauteng, South Africa. The main goal was to find the main principles of 
Total Quality Management (TQM) that contribute to the three dimensions of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) - 
Environmental, Social, and Economic Sustainability. The aim was also to evaluate how these principles can help in 
implementing sustainable development practices. 
 
The findings showed that different TQM principles have a significant but varied impact on the three dimensions of 
sustainability. The Evidence-Based Approach showed the strongest correlation with Economic Sustainability, 
indicating that making decisions based on data is essential for achieving economic goals. It is important to engage 
employees in environmental initiatives because their commitment has been shown to have a strong association with 
environmental sustainability. Process Management has been found to have a significant impact on improving Social 
Sustainability. This is because it plays a crucial role in promoting fair and effective organizational practices. 
 
Although there were positive correlations found, the study showed that relying solely on TQM may not be enough to 
achieve complete sustainability. Although TQM principles can greatly improve the social and economic aspects of 
sustainability, their effect on environmental sustainability is not as strong. This is evident from the relatively lower 
importance of Continuous Improvement in this particular area. So, although TQM is a useful framework for promoting 
sustainability, it's important to combine it with other strategies and measures to fully tackle the complexities of 
sustainable development. 
 
Future researchers could improve their study by including a wider range of participants from various regions and 
industries. This would help to make the findings more applicable to a larger population. In addition, it would be 
beneficial for future studies to investigate how TQM can be combined with other management frameworks and 
practices in order to create a more holistic approach towards achieving sustainability. Studying the long-term effects 
of implementing Total Quality Management (TQM) on sustainability outcomes could offer valuable insights for 
organizations looking to embrace sustainable practices.

Abstract 
Vehicle accidents have become the most significant problem on roads within South Africa. These accidents could 
result in mild to severe damage to the vehicles (sometimes purchased expensively) and/or in the loss of human 
life. Given the advances in pneumatics technology and automation, and the need to boost the safety capacities of 
vehicles to resist and limit damage to frontal collisions, this study proposes a sensor-aided pneumatic bumper 
activation system to reduce the impact force during a vehicle crash. We develop and analysed system-based model 
build-up to improve crashworthiness. The proposed system consists of a sensor transmitter, receiver unit, control 
unit, and bumper, and the proposed design is validated through simulation studies. The most important finding 
from this study was the improvement of crashworthiness in the case of a full-frontal collision between a vehicle 
and a barrier through the combination of the vehicle dynamics control systems with an extendable bumper. As 
obstacles approach the vehicle, with a control signal in place, the electronic circuit instantly activates the bumper 
to absorb the impact and keep it from getting too close to the vehicle's body. When the extendable bumper is 
deployed, the occupant's longitudinal displacement and acceleration are greatly reduced. The cost of high-end cars 
can be reduced by adopting this concept and providing equivalent levels of safety.  Also, the importance of 
pneumatics technology in automation, modern machine shops, and space robots is emphasized.

5.Conclusion  
The major goal of this system's design is to improve accident prevention techniques while also lowering the risk 
of accidents such as vehicle damage, human harm, etc.We discovered that our effort could achieve all the 
necessary goals. Cars with airbags have a high initial cost. We can cut the cost of high-end cars by adopting the 
Sensor-Aided Pneumatic Bumper Activation System and providing equivalent levels of safety. Airbags are useful 
for providing interior safety to passengers in vehicles, but in our proposal, we will give both internal and external 
safety to protect the vehicle from harm. As a result, we will lower the initial cost of cars while simultaneously 
providing additional benefits.Vehicle crash structures, vehicle dynamic control and extendable bumper systems 
are mostly part of the system introduced in this study. In addition, to capture the occupant dynamic response, a 
mathematical model has been constructed. Numerical models have shown that the extended bumper absorbs more 
collision energy than the typical structure at the same crash speed. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated with the 
programmed system’s results that the extended bumper actuated by a cylinder reduces intrusions and aids in 
keeping vehicle deceleration below acceptable limits.  
 
From the results obtained, the system has improved such that the controller introduced will be used to calculate 
the chance of collision. The extension of the bumper increases the time of impact and reduces the force of impact. 
Force is inversely proportional to time therefore when time increases, force will decrease. In so doing the injuries 
to the passengers will be reduced if not avoided. To improve on this study, combining numerous elements into 
this system to give greater protection through the intelligent braking system in real-time applications can be 
achieved. Some of the probable adjustments are as follows: A limit switch can be used to set the minimum speed 
at which the system will be activated. The bumper design can be improved to include external airbags. With a few 
tweaks, the project may be utilized with timer circuits to apply brakes and extend the bumper after a few 
milliseconds of delay, ensuring that the bumper does not extend until the vehicle is within crashing distance. 
Finally, comparative studies with other possible results using related techniques in the Literature will provide 
more insights into the efficacy of our designed system.

Abstract 
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia make up around 97.4% of the total business establishment. 
However, despite the large number of the workforce in SMEs, safety-related research is limited in this area in Malaysia 
specifically on safety culture. This study aims to assess the current safety culture level of SMEs in Malaysia. The 
questionnaire consisted of 37 items of six safety culture constructs based on organizational and human domains and 
was administered to SMEs registered in the government database. A total of 263 respondents from different sectors 
completed the survey. The survey result analysis shows that both employer and employee are proactive in 
implementing safety culture practices in the workplace. The lowest score identified among all the 6 factors was 
rewards and recognition in the workplace that can be improved to enhance the safety culture at the workplace. The 
grand mean score for SME is 3.76 which means that SME is still in the proactive stage of safety culture level at the 
workplace.

Introduction 
As Malaysia's economy develops rapidly, driven by the significant contribution of SMEs, occupational safety in these 
enterprises has often been neglected (Tappura et al. 2023). SMEs account for 97.4% of Malaysia’s industries 
(Department of Statistics Malaysia 2023), but they face challenges in adhering to formal safety management systems, 
laws, and regulations. SMEs often lack access to resource support and relevant risk prevention information (Lopatina, 
2013). In 2012, Basic Occupational Health programmes were introduced to guide SMEs in occupational health. The 
Basic Occupational Health Program is implemented to identify problems of occupational diseases or poisoning among 
workers who have not been through any basic health screening or basic medical check-ups, particularly in SMEs. 
Department Of Safety and Health (DOSH) Malaysia's approaches in implementing these programs are by cooperation 
with the “Umbrella Program” under the Small and Medium Industries Section in State offices and by providing 
guidance and technical programs with an emphasis on imparting knowledge in occupational health (DOSH 2024b). 
The implementation of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards in small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) is still in its early stages compared to large enterprises. On the National Institute for Occupational

Abstract 
The cosmetics industry in Indonesia is experiencing accelerated growth which has an impact on increasing competition 
and the need for continuous innovation, especially in the operational sector. This research aims to determine the 
optimal number of employees in each division, namely frontline, doctors, therapists, pharmacists and cashiers, as well 
as determining the productivity of employees in the therapy section of the Jogja-1 branch at PT XYZ. The methods 
used include productivity analysis and working time measurement (time study), as well as strategic analysis with cost 
analysis. It is hoped that the findings of this research can become a standard reference for PT XYZ. The results 
obtained in this research were able to reduce the number of manpower by 10 workers. The average level of therapist 
productivity is 76.03% during 2023. Based on the recommendation for the optimal number of manpower, the company 
can save labor costs of 175%.

1. Introduction
The beauty industry business in Indonesia is growing rapidly. Business in this sector continues to grow positively 
along with the changing point of view of Indonesian people in paying attention to their appearance. Not only adult 
women, nowadays teenagers are also starting to prioritize appearance (Susiani, et al. 2021). According to Statista data, 
revenue in Indonesia in 2022 in the beauty and personal care sector reached $7.37 billion or if converted at a dollar 
exchange rate of IDR 15,467.5, around IDR 113.9 trillion. Business in this sector is expected to continue to increase 
by 5.81% annually (www.statista.com, accessed August 10 2024). 
PT XYZ is engaged in the service industry in the beauty sector which has been established for more than 20 years. 
Based on the results of interviews with employees, PT XYZ has problems related to the increasing operational costs 
at the branch every year, the highest cost is in labor costs. This forces PT XYZ to continue to innovate to reduce waste 
in order to survive and be able to compete with new competitors. This is because there is no standard standard for 
determining labor in each branch. With a reference standard for the number of manpower, it will certainly make it 
easier for PT XYZ to plan recruitment and make production more efficient in terms of costs. Not only that, with the 
optimal use of labor, the company's productivity will also increase. Conversely, if labor is not used optimally, it will 
cause losses for the company and employees. Therefore, the researcher intends to examine the measurement of

Abstract 
Exploring the dynamics of team interactions and performance metrics within organizational simulations, this study 
delves into the intricacies of collaborative endeavors. Through the utilization of wearable sensors and Open Badges, 
a multi-round simulation was orchestrated, with the initial phase simulating a flawed sales process. Key performance 
indicators such as Throughput, Lead Time, and Query Rate were scrutinized alongside a detailed tracking of 
participant communications. The study seeks to measure the influence of communication patterns on performance 
metrics and team cohesion throughout the business simulation, with a particular emphasis on the optimization stage 
following the initial phase. Equipped with wearable sensors, participants navigated through the business simulation 
game while their interactions were meticulously recorded. Sociometric Badges were used to record data on the face-
to-face interaction, tonal conversational variation and physical proximity of the teams following the briefing phase of 
the business simulation game. Through data collection and analysis, communication frequencies, durations, and their 
impact on objective performance metrics were examined. The study highlights that communication patterns, 
particularly active participation and cross-team engagement, significantly impact performance in simulation-based 
learning environments, while demographic factors showed no significant effects. Noteworthy, teams engaging with 
neighboring counterparts during optimization generated approximately 30% more solution proposals. Additionally, 
equitable participation in discussions proved pivotal in fostering successful solution development. This study enriches 
our comprehension of the intricate interplay between communication dynamics, performance metrics, and team 
synergy within simulated organizational contexts. The implications underscore the role of communication strategies 
and inclusive participation in achieving optimal performance within business simulation games.

1. Introduction
Understanding the dynamics of team interactions and their impact on performance metrics within organizational 
settings is crucial for enhancing collaborative efficiency. This study investigates these dynamics through a business 
simulation that replicates real-world organizational challenges, specifically focusing on a flawed sales process as the 
initial phase. Previous research has emphasized the significance of interaction patterns in determining team success, 
yet the mechanisms by which these patterns influence performance metrics remain underexplored (Pentland 2012; 
Sole & Edmondson 2002). In this context, wearable sensors and Sociometric Badges can be employed to meticulously 
track face-to-face interactions, conversational tones, and physical proximity among participants, providing a rich 
dataset for analysis (Kim et al. 2012). By examining key performance indicators such as Throughput, Lead Time, and 
Query Rate, alongside communication frequencies and durations, the study seeks to delineate how communication 
behaviors affect both team cohesion and objective performance outcomes.

These findings highlight the critical importance of both internal team dynamics and external collaborations in 
maximizing the number and quality of solution proposals, underscoring the value of fostering a highly interactive and 
collaborative learning environment within team-based simulations. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study illuminates the intricate relationship between internal team dynamics, external collaborations, and 
performance outcomes in a simulation-based learning environment. The results from the Multivariate Analysis of 
Variance (MANOVA) revealed that variations in input factors such as gender, prior experience with simulation games, 
domain-specific knowledge, and practical experience did not exert a statistically significant influence on key 
performance indicators (KPIs) such as Lead Time, Throughput, and Error Rates. The absence of significant effects is 
likely attributable to the homogeneity within the student cohort, where limited demographic and experiential diversity 
may have mitigated the potential impact of these input variables. Conversely, the analysis of communication patterns 
underscored the critical role of active and equitable engagement in driving performance metrics. Teams that exhibited 
higher levels of participation, motivation, and balanced communication were markedly more efficient, achieving 
reduced lead times and enhanced throughput. Moreover, teams that engaged more frequently with facilitators and 
neighboring groups, particularly during the optimization phase, produced a greater number of solution proposals, 
thereby highlighting the importance of cross-team interactions in fostering innovation. 
Nevertheless, certain limitations must be addressed. The study’s emphasis on the quantity of communication, rather 
than its qualitative content, constrains a deeper understanding of the specific interactions that influence performance. 
Additionally, the inherent challenge of objectively assessing participation and motivation introduces a potential bias, 
suggesting a need for future research to adopt a more comprehensive approach to exploring these dimensions. The 
study’s small and homogenous sample further restricts the generalizability of the findings, underscoring the necessity 
for research involving more diverse and larger populations. It should also be noted that the underlying logical model 
excluded several influencing factors. Despite efforts to keep these constant, their impact on the present learning 
environment cannot be ruled out. Additionally, other confounding variables may not have been captured at all. A 
structured analysis of confounding variables should be addressed by future research. Future investigations should 
focus on the qualitative dimensions of communication, exploring how specific content and interaction types contribute 
to performance outcomes. Additionally, examining the differential impact of participant engagement across various 
demographic groups could yield more refined insights into optimizing team-based simulations. Despite these 
constraints, the findings reinforce the vital importance of cultivating both internal collaboration and external 
engagement to enhance the effectiveness of team-based learning environments.

Abstract 
The marine sector is on the verge of a technological revolution, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) poised to alter planned 
maintenance methods. Modern vessels are becoming more and more inefficient with traditional maintenance 
procedures that rely on manual input and repair list analysis, which might result in errors. These procedures can be 
made more efficient by utilizing AI. For example, repair lists can be automatically evaluated and integrated into 
Planned Maintenance Systems (PMS) with only one click, thereby decreasing the amount of manual labor and 
improving accuracy. AI's predictive powers not only simplify data integration but also enable proactive maintenance 
scheduling. AI can predict which materials are likely to need revamping by examining past material utilization, 
ensuring readiness and reducing downtime. This kind of foresight improves operating efficiency and vessel reliability 
in addition to optimizing resource allocation. Furthermore, AI, when combined with Large Language Models (LLM), 
enables real-time communication with stakeholders by producing detailed reports on vessel status, including 
maintenance tasks and material availability. Because of this transparency, management is able to act quickly and 
decisively, ensuring that all operational levels are strategically aligned. AI integration into maritime maintenance is a 
revolution rather than merely an improvement. The marine sector may attain unparalleled levels of efficiency, safety, 
and competitiveness by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into fundamental maintenance operations and 
communication tactics. This study lays the groundwork for a more intelligent and robust future by providing a thorough 
framework for integrating AI into maritime planned maintenance.

Table 1 and Figure 1 compare the performance of XGBoost, LSTM, and RNN machine learning models in predicting 
specific data points within a dataset. The primary metrics for comparing models are Mean Squared Error (MSE), 
Euclidean Distance, and the models' predictions at two key data points: data indices 60 and 80. Greater accuracy is 
indicated by higher values.  
Figure 1. Machine Learning Calculation for 100 overhauled O-Ring 
The MSE measure quantifies the average squared difference between actual and expected values. During this study, 
XGBoost showed superior predictive accuracy compared to LSTM and RNN, with the smallest MSE value being 
53746.57. Similarly, the Euclidean Distance calculates a distance metric by squaring the differences between the 
expected and actual values and taking the square root of the sum. 
The MSE metric measures the average squared gap between the predicted and true values, with reduced values 
suggesting greater precision. XGBoost outperformed LSTM and RNN in predictive accuracy by achieving the lowest 
MSE of 53746.57 in this study. Similarly, the Euclidean Distance calculates the square root of the sum of squared 
variances between the predicted and actual values, giving a comprehensive measure of distance. Once more, XGBoost 
achieved the highest accuracy with a Euclidean Distance of 2318.33, much lower than LSTM (3475.30) and RNN 
(3463.48), showing more accurate predictions. 
The forecasts at data points 60 and 80 additionally demonstrate how well the model is performing at particular indices. 
When it comes to predictions at the points of 7079.90 and 6889.88, XGBoost is more accurate than the other models, 
showing its strength and reliability. On the other hand, LSTM and RNN demonstrate less accurate forecasts, with 
LSTM predicting 6963.13 and 6949.64, and RNN predicting 6990.60 and 6999.09 at these specific points. 
In general, the table shows that XGBoost is the most successful model in this scenario, with lower error rates and more 
precise predictions than the LSTM and RNN models. 
6. Conclusion 
In this chapter, we aim to exploit the capabilities of AI in providing a comprehensive view of the overall failure problem 
and to suggest potential directions and related work in the maritime maintenance sector. The proposed system 
integrates a robust classification model with another predictive maintenance model to predict equipment failure, which 
will lead to minimizing a ship's unexpected mechanical failure. We highlight our direction by discussing our system 
in the context of the application points. Our future goals are to successfully carry out a real-world implementation of 
our system, building a strong learning framework in anticipation of service issues, and running over large data sets.

These can be like marine equipment and equipment register; fault report records, logbook records, and implemented 
maintenance. 
Over the years, many applications explored the data pattern from ship logbook records and carried out maintenance 
logs, such as maintenance optimization, condition-based monitoring, and failure diagnostics, etc. As a survey, only a 
few reviewed those applications and considered them in a coherent survey covering all data pillars. Due to the lack of 
such a survey, few systems focus on advanced maintenance, and it is hard in research and application to introduce the 
proposed hints. In addition to introducing the systems - diagnostics, prognostics, and health management, health 
metrics, etc., marine-based suggestions are not considered for new entries. With the constant expansion of big data and 
the establishment of digital twins, to revitalize the enterprise's competitive advantage, we suggest that maritime 
systems revitalize the operations of a ship and its operator. There is a risk of ignoring the potential business value. 
Instead, understanding ship operations using data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization introduces 
knowledge. In the future, it will evolve to meet the requirements. Enterprise data learning has the potential to be an 
essential strategy. To create a robust advanced traceability system, many maritime systems must continue the data 
learning solution approach, and our proposed AI-enhanced maritime maintenance will be considered as a reference 
guide.

Abstract 
Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a vital staple food and industrial raw material, particularly in Indonesia, where 
it holds significant economic importance. Despite its adaptability, cassava cultivation faces serious threats from plant 
diseases, leading to reduced productivity and quality. Traditional agricultural methods, often lacking modern 
technological interventions, exacerbate these challenges. To address this, a web-based expert system was developed 
to assist farmers in diagnosing and managing cassava diseases. The system integrates the Certainty Factor (CF) and 
Dempster-Shafer (DS) methods to handle uncertainty in disease diagnosis. Using the Adira 1 cassava variety, data 
was collected from a 2-hectare area in Bogor, focusing on five types of cassava diseases: Brown Leaf Spot, Blight 
Leaf Spot, Bacterial Blight, Anthracnose, and Root Rot. The CF method quantifies the certainty of specific facts, while 
the DS method combines evidence from various sources to determine the belief level of potential diagnoses. A 
comparative analysis of these models was conducted using 20 case studies. The results showed that the CF model 
achieved a 95% accuracy rate, slightly outperforming the DS model's 90% accuracy. Additionally, the system's 
usability was evaluated using the USE Questionnaire, which rated it as ""Highly Suitable"" with an overall score of 
84.5%.This study demonstrates that while both CF and DS models are effective in diagnosing cassava diseases, the 
CF model offers slightly higher accuracy. The developed expert system is not only accurate but also user-friendly and 
accessible, making it a valuable tool for improving cassava disease management practices.

Abstract 
Using biomass as a source of energy allows one to overcome the decreased supply of fossil fuels. Bio pellets—an 
energy product made from biomass—can be utilized. Bio-pellet research has employed a variety of biomass 
modifications. Combining or adding additional raw ingredients with superior qualities can raise the quality of the bio-
pellet itself. The walnut plant itself is a forest plant that grows widely in eastern Indonesia. Walnut trees are also 
located in the GOR Pajajaran area of Bogor City, although they are merely one of the flora there and have not been 
utilized in such a way. If developed and processed further into processed energy products, such as bio-pellets—which 
are typically used as fuel for winter heating or can also be used to replace petrol fuel because they are more affordable 
and environmentally friendly—walnut kernel shells have the potential to be an alternative energy source. Bio pellet 
research has employed a variety of biomass modifications. Combining or adding additional raw ingredients with 
superior qualities can raise the quality of the bio-pellet itself. Because palm kernel shells have a calorific value when 
burned, they are frequently employed as a basic ingredient in mixtures to create bio-pellets. Because of their high 
calorific value, palm oil shells may be used as an extra raw material to produce bio-pellets of a higher caliber. As far 
as the author knows, there have been known studies about potential walnut kernel shell from GOR Pajajaran area of 
Bogor City's as Bio-Pellet. The steps of raw material preparation, bio-pellet production, and biopellet characterization 
in accordance with SNI 8675:2018 on the quality of biomass pellets are where this research starts. This experiment 
was carried out by different ratios of walnut kernel shell and palm kernel shell, including 70%:30%, 50%:50%, 
30%:70%, and 0%:100%.  Combining them with a pre-established mixture, and then forming them using a pellet mill. 
The present study aims to investigate the potential walnut kernel shell Canarium Indicum L.) and its combination with 
palm kernel shell for processing into energy products, specifically bio-pellets. This study will focus on quality tests 
of bio pellet due to SNI 8675:2018. This experiment was carried out by different ratios of walnut kernel shell and 
palm kernel shell, including 70%:30%, 50%:50%, 30%:70%, and 0%:100%. Calorific value and proximate value will 
evaluated to obtain the highest-quality bio-pellets.

Abstract 
Fast and accurate detection of meat freshness is very important in the food industry because it directly affects the 
quality and safety of consumption. Traditional sensory assessments are often inefficient and subjective, so more 
reliable technology is needed. This research develops a system to detect beef freshness using the E-Nose tool and the 
KNN algorithm with accuracy, precision, and recall. E-Nose detects volatile compounds from beef, while KNN 
classifies sensor data. The study results show that this tool can identify the freshness level of beef with high accuracy 
so that it can be used to ensure meat quality in the food industry. The combination of E-Nose and KNN shows 
promising results in detecting beef freshness by identifying freshness biomarkers through aroma analysis. The KNN 
model trained with data from the E-Nose sensor can classify fresh, slightly fresh, and non-fresh meat with good 
precision, achieving an accuracy of 83%. Implementing this technology in the food industry can improve meat 
products' safety and quality standards, ensuring that consumers get safe products. Overall, E-Nose technology with 
the KNN is an effective, and efficient tool for detecting the freshness of beef, providing significant benefits for the 
food industry in maintaining product quality and safety.

Abstract 
The Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology under Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been rapidly utilized in many 
industries. However, their post-processing in manufacture is still required especially to increase the surface finish and 
dimensional precision for producing components effectively. Nevertheless, limited component qualities like as surface 
roughness or geometrical accuracy prevent them from being used directly after the printing process. As a result, 
functioning surfaces must be undergone post-processed (e.g., milling, grinding, polishing) in order to increase their quality 
and productivity. Due to the complexity of design structural, thermal, and process parameters in Selective Laser Melting 
(SLM), support structures are required to be machined. Currently, a few systematic researches have been conducted to 
reveal the support removability through several post-machining techniques. Based on this study, an experimental 
manufacturing of removing 316L stainless steel block supports by a milling process was conducted with a manufacturing 
plan and control being utilized. The milling machining performance of block supports at different cutting parameters is 
studied on the surface roughness. During this process, surface roughness, Ra is significantly affected by cutting speed, 
feed per tooth, step over, and cut pattern respectively. The results show that the minimum surface roughness, Ra is 
obtained at 0.595 μm when surface speed 40 m/min, feed per tooth 0.15 mm/tooth, and step over 0.065 mm with cut 
pattern following periphery operation mode was justified. The research findings give an important reference as well as a 
unique insight into the removal of metal support structures strategy through manufacturing planning and control of their 
machining processes. Furthermore, the removability of supports, which is generated from the post-processing stage, 
should be regarded as a new aspect in additive manufacturing of post-processing manufacturing components. Finally, this 
can increase the productivity of SLM-AM process components which also can support the digital manufacturing approach 
in the future.

Abstract 
The food and beverage industry relies heavily on water, not only as a key ingredient but also for essential processes 
such as cleaning and equipment maintenance. Ensuring high water quality is vital for maintaining product safety, taste, 
and shelf life. This study examines the consistency of municipal water quality in South Africa, with a particular focus 
on the Gauteng and Northwest provinces, and its alignment with the South African National Standard (SANS) 241. 
The research focuses on three companies located in Randfontein, Roodepoort, and Potchefstroom, analyzing historical 
water quality data over three years (2021–2023). The study aims to assess how inconsistent water quality affects the 
final product and proposes alternative water management systems to ensure consistently high water quality. The 
findings highlight significant challenges in maintaining water quality standards, with heavy metal contamination and

1. Introduction
Water is made up of two hydrogens and one oxygen atom chemically. The term ""universal solvent"" refers to aqueous 
water's ability to dissolve anything that comes into touch with it. In rivers that pass over limestone mountains, calcium 
carbonate is one of the minerals that is dissolved. In terms of biology, the ocean is home to numerous viruses, single-
celled organisms, and multicellular species, as well as the largest mammals (Luckmann et al. 2014).Water is a vital 
component in most food and beverage production, but it is frequently disregarded. The beverages industry makes 
extensive use of water, from cleaning to using it as a vital component in drinking. However, recent water quality 
concerns, such as the high lead levels discovered in Flint, Michigan's supply, have raised some serious concerns. 
Processors might presume that the municipal water utilized in the plant arrives safely (Lee and Lee 2015). 
Water quality can be determined by several variables, bacteria levels, dissolved oxygen concentrations, including the 
quantity of salt (or salinity), and the number of debris suspended in the water (turbidity). In some bodies of water, the 
quantity number of tiny algae and levels of pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals, and other contaminants may also be 
evaluated to determine water quality (Poretti 1990). Municipalities and bottled water firms are among the sources of 
water that frequently post their water quality data online for public use. The evaluated water quality criteria need to 
adhere to local government requirements, which are frequently affected by international standards established by 
businesses, including the World Health Organization (WHO) or organizations that monitor water quality (Luckmann. 
et al. 2014).

Abstract 
This paper aims to investigate the causes and consequences of inefficient maintenance operations at XYZ mine and 
their impact on organizational performance. The study follows an exploratory sequential mixed methods design that 
begins with a qualitative observation followed by a quantitative analysis of historical maintenance data. The findings 
of the study revealed significant inefficiencies, including engine failure, worn-out ground engagement tools, poor 
equipment condition, and equipment accident damage as leading factors to frequent equipment breakdowns, 
heightened safety incidents, and maintenance costs. The study also highlights safety issues stemming from non-
conformance with maintenance protocols and inadequate safety training. Recommendations include implementing 
risk assessments before the commencement of any operation, enhancing training programs, improving safety 
protocols, and considering investment in new equipment or comprehensive rebuilds. These measures aim to enhance 
equipment performance, lower maintenance costs, and increase safety, ultimately improving overall operational 
efficiency at the mine.

Introduction 
The mining industry is very important for the economy as it supplies essential raw materials for many sectors, 
generates large income by exports, and creates employment. In South Africa, the mining industry is the cornerstone 
of its economy. In 2023 the Minerals Council of South Africa reported that the mining sector contributed 
approximately 8% to South Africa's GDP, translating to around R400 billion. From an employment standpoint, the 
industry significantly contributed to job development by generating over 450,000 direct jobs and many indirect 
occupations. The majority of the minerals are primarily intended for export markets. The overall value of exports in 
2023 amounted to R883.5bn (equivalent to around US$54bn), representing a growth from R838.2bn in 2022. These 
figures highlight the critical role that mining plays in the economic landscape of South Africa, underpinning the 
importance of efficient and reliable mining operations (Minerals Council of South Africa 2023). The ultimate success 
of the mine is largely contingent upon the reliability and effectiveness of its heavy machinery. Mining companies 
encounter several obstacles in their continuous endeavors to minimize equipment downtime and sustain elevated 
production levels in the dynamic operational setting (Alta and Putri 2019). 
A study by Chan (2021) highlighted that maintenance operations encounter several challenges that have a significant 
impact on organizational performance. Key among these challenges is rising costs associated with maintenance and

performance. The findings and recommendations provided a clear pathway for XYZ Mine to enhance its maintenance 
operations and overall organizational performance. Therefore, based on the findings and the solutions provided, the 
study accomplished its intended aim and objectives. 
It is also worth noting that the implementation of these proactive strategies may encounter a variety of obstacles. First, 
there may be resistance from staff who are accustomed to the old ways of conducting tasks, which include a reactive 
attitude and disregard for safety regulations. Implementing the change would require a significant adjustment in both 
mindset and operational procedures. Moreover, the financial impact cannot be overlooked. For instance, the decision 
to invest in new equipment or rebuild is costly. Then there are the initial costs and resources required to invest in 
operator training programs. All these factors add up, potentially straining the mine's budget and disrupting existing 
workflows. Another factor that needs to be taken into account is ensuring consistent compliance with the new 
maintenance protocols, which may require continuous monitoring and management; this could prove to be difficult, 
taking into account the mine's demanding operational environment. Overcoming these challenges will be critical to 
successfully implementing proactive strategies therefore enhancing the mine’s maintenance operations and improving 
overall efficiency. 
Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of implementing the recommended improvements on 
organizational performance at XYZ mine and similar mining operations. Future studies could also look into 
conducting a comparative study between mines that rely on reactive maintenance versus those that have adopted 
proactive maintenance strategies, focusing on equipment performance, cost reduction and safety outcomes.

Abstract 
This study focuses on enhancing the efficiency of industrial plant layouts, which are often suboptimal in traditional 
designs, leading to issues like reduced productivity, longer lead times, and higher maintenance costs. The research 
applies a flexible layout design to improve operations at General Industries, transitioning into the Yemeni Company 
for Engineering Industries (YCIE). Through a comprehensive literature review and case study analysis of the Hayel 
Saeed Anam Group's central workshop, the study develops a new layout tailored to the company's needs. Key findings 
emphasize the importance of flexibility, safety, and efficient material flow in optimizing plant operations.

1. Introduction
The internal layout of an industrial plant is a critical factor that directly impacts its operational efficiency and 
productivity. A well-designed plant layout can significantly enhance production processes by reducing material 
handling time, minimizing worker movement, and optimizing space utilization. On the other hand, poor layout design 
can lead to longer lead times, increased operational costs, and reduced productivity. This study focuses on the design 
and implementation of a flexible plant layout at the Yemeni Company for Engineering Industries (YCEI), aiming to 
improve its operational efficiency. The existing layout was found to be suboptimal, resulting in inefficiencies such as 
excessive material handling and longer process times. The research applies industrial engineering techniques, 
including flow analysis and Rank Order Clustering (ROC), to develop a new layout tailored to the specific needs of 
YCEI. The proposed layout is expected to enhance productivity, reduce waste, and support the company's vision of 
continuous improvement and operational excellence. 
The application of a flexible and optimized plant layout is essential for YCEI as it transitions to meet the growing 
demand for its products. By focusing on key factors such as material flow, safety, and adaptability, the study aims to 
demonstrate how strategic layout design can lead to significant improvements in manufacturing efficiency.

4. Result and Discussion  
The comparative analysis between the existing layout and the newly proposed group technology (GT) layout has been 
discussed in this chapter. The objective of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of the existing layout in the 
central workshop of the Hayel Saeed Anam Group and propose a more effective layout based on the group technology 
approach. 
 
4.1. Current Layout Efficiency 
The present layout was analyzed for flow, with the support of a From-To chart giving a total number of parts movement 
between machines. The analysis showed that the existing layout was not optimized. A large number of inefficiencies 
were experienced due to long distances traveled by the parts and high materials handling. The total efficiency of the 
current layout was 56.62%. This relatively low efficiency indicated that the current layout was not effectively 
supporting the increasing demand for spare parts manufacturing. Dispersed machine arrangement led to unnecessary 
delays and increased nonproductive time for material handling and transportation. 
 
4.2. Use of Group Technology Layout 
To correct the inefficiencies found in the existing layout, a GT layout was proposed. A Group Technology Layout is 
ROC-designed and clusters machines around part families defined by the similarity of processes used on them. Parts 
would only have to move short distances with linked operations located closely together. The new layout was 
structured in three well-defined manufacturing cells: 
- Cell 1: Base, Gear, Knife, Slinch; Operations - Grinding, Turning, Milling, Shaper. 
- Cell 2: Shaft, Roll, Sabrocat; Machines: Grinding, Turning, Milling, Drilling. 
- Cell 3: Bush, Ben, Gaud; Machines - Turning, Planer. 
 
4.3. Comparative Layout Efficiencies 
The present design was compared to the efficiency of the newly proposed GT layout. The results showed a drastic 
improvement in efficiency as follows: 
 
- Cell 1 Efficiency: 86.7% 
- Cell 2 Efficiency: 66.75% 
- Cell 3 Efficiency: 100% 
- New Layout Efficiency Rate: 84.48% 
 
However, the total efficiency in the existing layout was very low at 56.62%. The observation is that the GT layout 
provides a more systematic production process that reduces nonproductive time related to handling, transportation, 
and waiting. Efficiency was enhanced in the GT layout due to less travel of parts; that is, machines closer to one 
another in one cell reduced the need for a part to travel over long distances. This not only reduces the level of delay 
but also makes the workflow effective as similar operations are grouped together. 
 
5. Discussion 
According to the findings, the GT layout is an effective approach to enhance the efficiency of the manufacturing 
layout. Improvement from 56.62% to 84.48% in layout efficiency is indicative of a big reduction in waste and 
nonproductive activities. Minimization of unnecessary movement and handling has shortened production times, 
thereby reducing operational costs associated with the GT layout. Therefore, comparing the present layout with the 
GT layout enforces the fact that layout design plays a critical role in determining manufacturing efficiency. In light of 
this fact, since the GT layout focuses more on lowering transportation and material handling costs, it is more efficient 
and effective for meeting increased production demand at Hayel Saeed Anam Group.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The project considered in this case was an optimization of a manufacturing layout for the Central Workshop of one of 
the biggest and most diversified industrial organizations in Yemen and the Middle East, Hayel Saeed Anam Group. 
The tremendous increase in the demand for spare parts prompted the group to want to form a new company by the 
name of Yemeni Company for Engineering Industries, and it hence knew that there was a dire need to increase the 
efficiency of the work done by it. A systematic approach using flow analysis and Rank Order Clustering (ROC) 
accurately identified inefficiencies with the present layout and suggested an alternative, more productive design. 
Analysis of the present layout indicated that the current layout is only 56.62% efficient, which demonstrates that a lot 
1062","Proceedings of Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
is left to be desired. A significant improvement to 84.48% efficiency was attained in the study by reconfiguring the 
layout into three cells that had been optimized for specific routings. 
 
One of the major breakthroughs attained with the new layout was a tremendous reduction in non-value-added 
activities, such as excessive transportation, unnecessary delays, and idle operations. Shorter manufacturing lead time 
came as a direct benefit of the new layout; this shorter lead time would reduce the distance between consecutive 
operations and the flow of parts through the shop would be smooth. Shorter manufacturing time was also one of the 
factors behind lower operating costs, which occurred as a result of effective utilization of resources and minimization 
of wasteful activities. It reduced nonproductive time, making the productive process quicker and raising its cost-
efficiency at the same time. This in effect enabled the workshop to produce the required spare parts within a reduced 
timeframe and at a lower cost than previously—since the growth in demand for them requires more and more 
production without drops in quality. 
 
Such time and cost efficiency improvements genuinely play an extremely important role overall in keeping this 
workshop competitive in the market and reacting accordingly to an increase in production demand. It can therefore be 
concluded that strategic layout design is one of the prime essentials in manufacturing industries. In this study, a less 
efficient traditional layout of the system was transformed by very strict analysis tools into a highly optimized system 
where productivity was boosted very significantly. So, the success of this project just proves how important continuous 
improvement is in any industrial operation with respect to reducing nonproductive activities, and thereby shortening 
manufacturing times and costs. This is an operational framework and dictates that an effective layout design is crucial 
for achieving operational excellence in similar endeavors across various manufacturing settings.

Abstract 
Maintaining industrial system in high availability is particularly crucial and significant in production processes, which 
in turn affect profitability. This paper will develop a new Markov Decision Process model for system availability 
optimization under budget constraints. The primary objective will be to optimize long-run availability, meaning 
maximization of expected system uptime at minimum cost of operation per unit time. Given the dual objectives, our 
model will focus on availability and consider the cost as one of its constraints. Such a model provides practical 
maintenance decision-making by integrating real-world data within the MDP framework. We solve the proposed 
model using linear programming, and results show a balance between system performance and financial sustainability. 
Further challenges remain in the estimation of the parameters of the system accurately. In this respect, future work is 
needed to enhance the robustness and adaptability of the model to handle such complex systems in real-time 
environments.

The implementation of the MDP model using linear programming successfully identifies the optimal maintenance 
policy for maximizing system availability. The results show that the best policy gives high priority to actions 
maintaining the system in high-availability states when a minimal repair policy can be implemented. That is confirmed 
by Table (1), when the system in high-availability state (S1), the optimal decision rule would be to keep availability 
as high as possible without taking unnecessary interventions by choosing the action ""do nothing,"" since it minimizes 
the cost of maintenance. 
In the S2 state, when it is slightly deteriorated, minimal repairs should be performed, and they can be refined to assure 
cost-effectiveness. When deterioration has worsened—that is, in the S3 state—minimal repairs are also quite critical 
to prevent the system from failing. Major repair is required once it reaches the state of failure, S4, to get the system 
up again at full efficiency.  
 
The results show that although the cost of minimal repair is the lowest compared to other repair options, it is not the 
most profitable repair policy as the system availability cannot be brought back to its perfect state. Major repairs, 
although expensive, will be cost-effective when the loss due to failure of systems involves more delay and financial 
losses. The linear programming solution includes budget constraints that guarantee the proposed policies are 
financially feasible. It means the optimum policy that keeps the budget while maximizing the system availability, 
managing the financial resources appropriately to maintain high performance levels. 
7. Conclusion  
The study presents an integrative method to optimize maintenance scheduling in the MDP model for industrial systems 
under budget constraints and proposes an effective maintenance policy that balances system availability against budget 
limits under uncertainty. Because the model adapts to changes in the system, it minimizes the occurrence of financial 
risks due to over-maintenance or under-maintenance. Hence, it has practical applicability in real-world maintenance 
decision-making. The primary issue here is that it is quite hard to correctly estimate the transition probabilities between 
system states, and for that purpose, lots of data are to be collected. Besides, it is assumed that the budget is fixed, 
while under normal conditions, production equipment is exposed to an increased failure rate with time. These two 
challenges indicate the directions for further research.

Abstract 
This report presents an analysis of train delays within a railway network using Markov chain models. By simulating 
realistic delay data for ten trains over a specific route, we categorized delays into five distinct states and constructed 
both the transition count matrix and the transition probability matrix. These matrices quantify the likelihood of 
transitioning between different delay states, offering a probabilistic view of delay progression. The steady-state vector, 
derived from the transition matrix, indicates the long-term distribution of delay states, providing insights for long-
term operational planning. These metrics are crucial for improving scheduling, maintenance, and resource allocation. 
The results demonstrate the robustness and interpretability of Markov chain models for predicting train delays, 
enabling railway operators to enhance service reliability and operational efficiency.

Abstract 
Digitalization has emerged as a dominant force in transforming business processes, significantly enhancing overall 
performance. The impact of Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0) on traditional business models presents attractive 
opportunities through disruptive technologies. In the medical device sector, a crucial part of the modern economic 
supply chain, embracing digitalization is essential for adapting to a dynamic marketplace. This transformation requires 
manufacturers to rethink their business models and create innovative solutions to stay competitive. This paper 
examines the current business model of the O&P industry, identifies areas for improvement through Business Process 
Reengineering (BPR), and explores how digitalization can further enhance the industry's efficiency, quality, and 
patient outcomes.  Utilizing a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) framework, the research systematically 
evaluates and redesigns traditional workflows within the Malaysian orthotics and prosthetics (O&P) industry. A pilot 
study will compare conventional methods with a new digital approach in manufacturing Below Knee Prosthesis 
Sockets. The findings highlight the need for a strategic approach to integrating digital technologies within a 
reengineered business framework

1. Introduction
Digitalization, also known as digital transformation, refers to the integration of digital technologies into various 
aspects of industrial processes and operations. It involves the use of digital tools, technologies, and data to enhance 
efficiency, productivity, and decision-making within industries. The introduction of digitalization has significantly

As part of the redesign, digital technologies are integrated into the process to streamline operations, reduce errors, and 
improve outcomes. This could involve automating certain tasks, introducing new software tools, or adopting advanced 
manufacturing techniques. The goal is to create a process that is faster, more efficient, and better aligned with the 
organization’s strategic goals.  Once the redesigned process is developed, it is piloted on a small scale to test its 
effectiveness. Feedback from this pilot phase is used to make any necessary adjustments before full-scale 
implementation. This iterative approach helps ensure that the new process is robust and capable of delivering the 
desired improvement.  After implementation, the new process is continuously monitored to ensure it meets the set 
objectives. BPR is not a one-time event but a continuous effort to refine and improve business processes over time. 
Performance metrics are tracked, and further adjustments are made as needed to optimize the process. 
 
The illustration below describes on the proposed redesign process in the current core business activities in the industry.

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the research findings indicate that implementing digitalization in the fabrication process can 
significantly address the bottlenecks identified in the current business model of the Orthotics and Prosthetics (O&P) 
industry. Specifically, the use of advanced digital technologies such as CAD/CAM systems and 3D scanning can 
enhance the accuracy of initial fittings and streamline the adjustment process. The pilot study revealed that these

technologies helps to reduce the time required for multiple appointments and improve overall efficiency. This is 
supported by studies such as Raghda Abu El-Ezz (2020), which demonstrated the use of CAD-CAM technologies in 
the design of transtibial socket significantly reduce design and fitting time and improve fit accuracy in prosthetic 
devices. Additionally, research by A. Kumar and D. Chhabra (2022) highlights that a cleaner fabrication framework 
using Additive Manufacturing technologies can enhance process capability for the commercial customization of 
biomechanically efficient orthoses, thereby favoring sustainable rehabilitation. By integrating digital solutions, the 
industry can achieve better resource allocation, minimize production delays, and enhance patient outcomes. This 
underscores the critical need for digital transformation in the production of below-knee sockets to optimize the entire 
process and meet the increasing demand effectively. The adoption of digital technologies not only aligns with current 
industry trends but also ensures that the O&P industry remains competitive and capable of delivering high-quality 
care to patients. 
 
Findings from the pilot study also indicate several bottlenecks within the current fabrication process of below-knee 
sockets, such as lengthy production times and the need for multiple adjustments. These insights have led this research 
to implement digitalization and study its impact on productivity. By integrating advanced digital technologies such as 
CAD/CAM systems and 3D scanning, the fabrication process can be significantly enhanced. This redesign aims to 
streamline the initial fitting process, reduce the number of necessary adjustments, and improve overall production 
efficiency. Further research will focus on assessing the effectiveness of digitalization in enhancing productivity, 
ensuring a more efficient, scalable, and patient-centered approach that ultimately improves patient outcomes and 
operational capabilities.

Abstract 
In the highly competitive environment of private universities, academic staff often experience job insecurity, leading 
to increased turnover intention and reduced job satisfaction. This study examines the moderating role of perceived 
organizational support (POS) in this dynamic. While prior research has explored the direct effects of job insecurity on 
turnover intention and job satisfaction, the uniqueness of this study lies in its focus on how POS can buffer these 
negative outcomes specifically within the context of private higher education institutions. Data were collected from 
250 academic staff members across various private universities in the LLDikti II region and analyzed using Structural 
Equation Modeling (SEM). The results reveal that job insecurity is significantly and positively related to turnover 
intention and negatively associated with job satisfaction. Crucially, the study finds that perceived organizational 
support significantly moderates these relationships, mitigating the adverse effects of job insecurity by enhancing job 
satisfaction and reducing turnover intention. This research highlights the importance of fostering a supportive 
organizational environment as a strategic initiative to improve faculty retention and satisfaction in private universities. 
The findings contribute to the existing literature by providing fresh insights into the contextual factors affecting 
academic staff in private higher education and offer practical implications for university administrators and 
policymakers seeking to develop targeted interventions that support organizational well-being.

1.Introduction
The intense competition among private higher education institutions (PHEIs) in Indonesia has created significant 
challenges for these organizations, particularly in retaining and enhancing faculty satisfaction. One of the noticeable 
impacts of this competition is the decline in student enrollment at several PHEIs, which, in turn, diminishes faculty

decline in psychological well-being and work motivation. Perceived Organizational Support (POS) acts as an effective 
moderating variable. High organizational support can reduce the negative effects of Job Insecurity (JI) on Job 
Satisfaction (JS) and Turnover Intention (TI). With the perceived support from the organization, lecturers or 
employees are more likely to feel secure in their jobs and more satisfied, as well as have a lower intention to leave the 
organization. Job Satisfaction (JS) has a significant negative effect on Turnover Intention (TI). Lecturers or employees 
who are more satisfied with their jobs tend to have a lower desire to leave the organization, emphasizing the importance 
of improving job satisfaction to reduce turnover rates. 
 
The Managerial Implications of this research are that organizations need to increase employee support perceptions 
through policies that strengthen job security, such as providing training programs, mentoring, and improving welfare. 
This will help reduce the negative effects of job insecurity and increase employee satisfaction and loyalty. 
Management must focus on efforts to reduce job uncertainty by providing transparent communication about job 
futures, clarifying career structures, and creating a stable work environment. These steps can reduce turnover intention 
and increase job satisfaction. Organizations need to create a supportive work-life balance environment, attractive 
incentives, and career development opportunities to enhance employee job satisfaction. This increased satisfaction 
will directly contribute to loyalty and reduced intention to leave. To reduce the intention of lecturers or employees to 
leave the organization, it is important for management to proactively address factors influencing job satisfaction and 
job uncertainty. Effective retention programs, such as fair performance appraisals and increased opportunities for 
professional development, can reduce undesirable turnover rates.

Abstract 
Depopulation and aging are currently problems in many regional cities in Japan. In these areas, it becomes difficult to 
maintain public transport services and ensure mobility for residents. This leads to reduced communication among 
residents and a lower quality of life. It is important to provide sustainable mobility for residents to avoid the collapse 
of the community in these areas. To solve these local problems, the author’s group has developed low-speed electric 
community buses (LSECBs) and researched their effects on social implementation. The LSECBs are electric vehicles 
that can travel on public roads at speeds less than 20 km/h (5.56 m/s). The LSECBs were jointly developed with the 
participation of local companies, local government, universities, and residents. The LSECBs are suitable for short-
distance operations within small regional areas. LSECB can promote communication strengthen bonds between 
people, and also improve quality of life. This study examines the effectiveness of LSECBs in enhancing the 
sustainability of local communities.

1.Introduction
The concept of Low-Speed Electric Community Buses (LSECBs) was developed in the project JST-RISTEX (Japan 
Science and Technology Agency - Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society) program in 2011.  The 
title of the JST-RISTEX program was “Community-Based Actions against Global Warming and Environmental 
Degradation”. It was an R&D project involving many regional research groups (Shigeto et al. 2014, Horio et al. 2014). 
LSECBs were designed to reduce CO2 emissions from the transportation and revitalization of the local community. It 
is an electric vehicle that can travel on public roads at speeds of less than 20 km/h (5.56 m/s). It is jointly developed 
with the participation of local companies, local governments, universities, and residents (Amagai, et al. 2023). The

Figure 10.  Questionnaire results for frequency of conversation, going out and shopping 
 
The results show that more respondents said that using the LSECB had ‘increased’ or ‘slightly increased’ the frequency 
of ‘conversations’ and ‘going out’ than those who said it had ‘unchanged’. The results for shopping frequency for 
those in their 60’s and 70’s showed that ‘increased’, ‘slightly increased’, and ‘unchanged’ were at the same level. The 
frequency of each also appears to increase with age. Elderly people who live alone or drive alone were found to rate 
their LSECB rides positively. This suggests that they not only appreciate the ride but also the contact with others. It 
has been pointed out that social capital is declining in American society (Putnam (2000)). Driving alone in a car 
without using public transport contributes to the decline of social capital. LSECBs can be interpreted as supporting 
people to break free from ‘driving alone’. 
 
4. Conclusions 
This study introduced the Low-Speed Electric Community Buses (LSECBs), which were jointly developed with the 
participation of local companies, local authorities, residents, and university. The social implementation of LSECBs 
has been shown to bring a variety of unanticipated benefits to the community. For example, they can act as a 
mechanism to generate conversation among community members and connect various community organizations. It is 
important to evaluate not only the technical aspects of these new vehicles such as LSECBs, but also the social aspects. 
The value that LSECBs bring to the community also needs to be discussed in detail based on a socio-technical 
approach.

Abstract 
We evaluate the impact of AI applications in power systems on energy security. We analyze the benefits and risks 
associated with AI implementation on the European power grid, focusing on four dimensions of energy security: 
availability, affordability, accessibility, and acceptability. We investigated the benefits of AI using PyPSA-Eur, a 
Python-based model of the European electricity system. Three AI applications were parametrized: load reduction, load 
shifting, and wind wake steering. We compared scenarios in which these AI applications are widely deployed against 
a baseline scenario without these applications. We also analyze risks associated with AI deployment in the power grid. 
We developed a risk taxonomy centered around six high-level categories: cybersecurity, jurisdictional or sovereignty 
issues, unexplained or unexpected actions by the model, unethical or illegal decision-making, reliance and trust in 
decision-making, and supplier dependency and vendor lock-in. We conducted a back-casting exercise with subject-
matter experts to determine positive and negative future outcomes of AI deployment and identify actions to create 
positive outcomes and avoid negative ones. We find that AI applications can improve energy security in power 
systems. In the scenarios we tested, behind-the-meter applications have a greater impact on energy security.

1.Introduction
This study investigates the opportunities and risks that may flow from the deployment of AI applications in the 
electricity system. Electricity systems around the world are changing rapidly due to rising demand, the need to replace 
aging infrastructure, and the need to decarbonize the electricity system. These changes are increasing the vulnerability 
of the electricity system to disruptions. In this fast-changing environment, AI applications may help improve the 
resilience of electricity systems, but they may also exacerbate the vulnerabilities and increase new risks. This paper 
aims to provide an overview of the opportunities and risks offered by AI applications in the electricity system and 
offer several recommendations to policymakers on how to take advantage of the opportunities while avoiding the 
risks. In this paper, we rely on the concept of energy security as a metric for capturing the opportunities and risks 
related to the deployment of AI in the electricity system. For this report, we base ourselves on the definition of energy

mandatory sandboxes where potential AI applications can be extensively tested before their deployment into the 
electricity system. The electricity system is interconnected with other infrastructure systems. For example, a blackout 
could cause issues with the water system, because the latter depends on pumps powered by electricity. When designing 
policy approaches to mitigate the risks of AI applications in the electricity system, policymakers need to engage with 
a wide range of stakeholders from different industries, to ensure they understand relevant interconnections.

AI would seem to offer much to balance the competing pressures and opportunities the electricity system is facing. Its 
ability to rapidly see patterns in large amounts of data and from a range of sources, and to make decisions with that 
information much faster than a human could, seem well suited to complex electricity systems.  
These systems could use the help. More is being asked of aging electricity infrastructure, as growing populations and 
changing demand patterns put pressure on systems not designed for it. Moreover, a warming climate, and the extreme 
weather that comes with it, not only further raise the electricity demand, but also increases the risk to the infrastructure 
that generates and supplies it. Added to this, rapidly changing technologies raise the cost for energy companies in 
updating their infrastructure, while also raising the opportunity cost – as the risk of investments being more quickly 
rendered obsolescent is higher now than in the past. The business model is changing, and this presents fundamental 
and even existential questions for companies in energy generation and supply. AI’s potential to sift through and 
balance supply and demand across an increasingly stressed system, isolate problems before they spread, and identify 
where the greatest gains from new investment might be found has seen some energy suppliers already introduce AI 
into their operations. These gains may only become sharper and more apparent as AI technology improves, and our 
means of testing those gains also improves.  
 
The benefits mainly lie behind the meter 
This study sought to test the potential for AI to improve the level of energy security in electricity systems. The research 
team found significant potential benefits for the application of AI behind the meter, which are applications installed 
on consumer premises that directly try to make energy consumption more efficient. For example, we found that AI 
applications that aim to make heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) installations more efficient could 
have a significant positive impact on the overall energy security of the system. In addition, AI applications that can 
guide demand response and help consumers react more dynamically in response to changing electricity prices also 
had a clear impact. However, the research team found negligible benefits detected in front of the meter. This was 
surprising – we expected the benefits of AI to be seen more broadly throughout the system. Nevertheless, our analysis 
showed that AI-driven wake steering of wind turbines did not markedly improve energy security. We also noted that 
the combination of different front-of-meter and back-of-meter AI applications led to tradeoffs between the benefits 
offered by the different applications. 
 
The risks of AI should not be overlooked 
Despite these opportunities, the deployment of AI applications in the electricity system also comes with risks. Our 
research points to cybersecurity risks, jurisdictional or territorial sovereignty issues, the risk of unexplained or 
unexpected actions, unethical or illegal decision-making by the model, a failure in human-machine interaction, and 
supplier dependency and vendor lock-in. Commercial pressures may see electricity supply companies look to institute 
AI before it is mature or save costs on human oversight. Manipulating AI or the system around it is also a compelling 
vector for a nefarious actor to exploit, with potentially widespread consequences. It may be difficult to undo the 
implementation of AI application in the electricity system. Policymakers, regulators, and energy companies should 
therefore carefully balance the opportunities and risks offered by specific AI applications. 
 
Our approach has limitations 
The research team faced some obstacles and limitations in undertaking this research. Our quantitative modeling was 
limited by the availability of sufficiently complete generation and consumption data of the European electricity 
system, as well as useable data or projections about the performance of AI applications. We also found a surprising 
reticence among experts, both in and out of the energy business, to speak to the research team about the pros and cons 
of AI. In some cases, this appeared to be due to a dearth of potential participants who felt comfortable engaging with 
both the AI and the energy supply sides of this research, highlighting a potential knowledge gap. It may also have 
been the case that this is a commercially sensitive area, and some invited participants were reluctant to engage on that

basis. This speaks to the importance of further research in this area, to be able to assist policymakers in understanding 
where the opportunities are, the best options to access them, and how best to minimize the risks.

Abstract 
This study analyzes the impact of business process digitalization, self-efficacy, and family support on perceived work-
life balance among public sector employees in four provinces of Indonesia: South Sumatra, the Riau Islands, Jakarta, 
and Banten. The research employs a quantitative approach, collecting data through questionnaires from a sample of 
378 respondents, all of whom are civil servants working in provincial offices, employed since at least 2018, over 25 
years of age, and voluntarily participating in this study. A non-probability purposive sampling method was used, based 
on demographic characteristics and the study's objectives. Data collection was conducted online using a survey 
questionnaire. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS23. The results of this research have important implications 
for organizational improvement, indicating that digitalization and self-efficacy do not significantly affect perceived 
work-life balance, while family support has a positive and significant impact. Only hypothesis 3 (H3) was accepted. 
Future research may explore variables such as workload, work flexibility, technology quality, and enthusiasm for 
learning. The managerial implications emphasize the need for management to support employees in enhancing digital 
skills, self-efficacy, and integrating family support.

Introduction 
 Human resource management faces significant challenges, particularly in today's global digital era Vuori et al. (2019). 
As individuals join the workforce, they encounter critical tasks, job demands, and the level of recognition for their 
contributions. Organizations, in turn, assess how well these tasks are performed to determine appropriate 
compensation. However, as highlighted by Schaufeli et al. (2004) and Rahman et al. (2023), the actual execution of 
these tasks often falls short of covering all responsibilities within the organization. Effective human resource 
management is vital for maintaining company efficiency, especially during periods of disruption, such as the COVID-
19 pandemic, which has further complicated issues related to investment and business sustainability (Mufraini et 
al.2021; Mirfaqoh et al. 2023), and underscores the need for adaptability in various work environments (Ten et al. 
2012; Yusriani et al. 2023a). 
Public servants, or Aparatur Sipil Negara (ASN), play a strategic role in achieving the national goals outlined in the 
Preamble of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. Achieving these goals requires ASN to demonstrate

Abstract 
Badung Regency as one of the regencies in Bali Province that has a construction service package in Badung Regency 
experienced a significant increase in 2023 as many as 128 project data. Project development always continues to 
increase due to demand by project owners, which occurs during the project period causing construction changes. These 
changes result in inconsistencies with the initial plan. Changes occur very often, so they will have an impact on 
increasing costs, late project completion, and also building quality that does not comply with the quality plan. The 
impact of contract changes occurs on costs because additional costs have implications for increasing work volume. 
The description of the work of implementing a building construction project is very complex, so it is rare in a building 
construction project that there is no change in the contract until the project is completed. In this study, a deductive 
approach will be carried out with a quantitative method. The sampling technique used is non-probability sampling 
with the convenience sampling method. There are 5 (five) factors that form contract changes, 5 (five) factors form 
cost performance, 6 (six) factors form time performance, 5 (five) factors form quality performance. The relationship 
model describes the direct relationship between contract changes and project performance using the second order on

government building projects in Badung Regency include 1) design changes causing scheduling shifts, 2) control over 
changes in work, 3) worker productivity, and 4) Compliance with terms of reference. 
Recommendations for the government include considering the dominant factors that positively influence project 
performance when making decisions for future projects.

Abstract 
Construction projects can generate various types of waste, including solid, liquid, and gas waste. If this waste is not 
managed effectively, it can cause disruptions to project activities and have negative impacts on the surrounding 
environment. To address this issue, research was conducted to identify the factors causing construction waste and the 
methods for managing it in construction projects. This study involved distributing questionnaires to project managers 
who are currently or have previously been involved in construction projects in Bali. The data from these questionnaires 
were then tabulated and analyzed using Factor Analysis to identify the primary causes of construction waste with the 
assistance of SPSS software, and the Scoring Method was used to evaluate waste management practices. The analysis 
revealed that the dominant factors contributing to construction waste include: Worker competence and skills, Material 
handling not in accordance with work procedures, Material quality not meeting specifications, Inadequate Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOP). The most commonly implemented construction waste management practices in projects 
in Bali include: having clear procedures for material handling and storage, conducting strict and regular supervision 
of workers to minimize errors, storing materials in weather-protected and easily accessible locations, reusing materials 
for tasks where leftover materials can still be used, and regularly monitoring and evaluating construction waste 
management.

5.3 Discussion 
The analysis reveals that while some effective waste management practices are in place, challenges persist due to 
factors such as inadequate knowledge, poor material handling, and low-quality materials. Improving these areas could 
significantly reduce construction waste. Recommendations 
• Training and Education: Enhance training programs for workers and contractors to improve knowledge and skills 
in waste management. 
• Improved Handling Procedures: Develop and implement better procedures for material handling and storage. 
• Quality Control: Ensure higher quality standards for materials and implement effective planning for material use. 
• Waste Management Systems: Establish and enforce comprehensive waste management systems on all projects. 
• Monitoring and Evaluation: Continuously monitor and evaluate waste management practices to identify and 
address issues. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the research on the factors causing construction waste and the management of construction waste conducted 
on building projects in Bali, the following conclusions can be made Worker competence and skills, Material handling 
not in accordance with work procedures, Material quality not meeting specifications, Inadequate Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP). The most frequently performed construction waste management practices in Bali, falling under the 
categories of reduce, reuse, and recycle, include: Having clear procedures for material handling and storage, 
Conducting strict and regular supervision of workers to minimize errors, Storing materials in weather-protected and 
easily accessible locations, Reusing materials for work where leftover materials can still be used, Regular monitoring 
and evaluation of construction waste management.

Abstract 
One of the strategies that can be implemented to achieve sustainable energy self-sufficiency is to increase the use of 
renewable energy sources. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal have the 
potential to provide clean, reliable, and affordable energy. Countries that are rich in renewable energy resources can 
leverage these resources to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and achieve energy self-sufficiency. Based on the 
background and problem formulation that has been conveyed, this study aims to develop a decision-making framework 
to identify and recommend optimal renewable energy solutions for Southwest Sumba, considering local conditions, 
resource potential, and sustainability criteria. This research employs a systematic approach to develop a decision-
making framework for identifying and recommending optimal renewable energy solutions in Southwest Sumba. The 
study will focus on creating a structured process that considers local conditions, resource potential, and sustainability 
criteria. The development of a comprehensive and adaptive decision-making framework is crucial for determining 
optimal renewable energy solutions in remote areas such as Southwest Sumba. A multi-stage approach that integrates 
Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods such as TOPSIS, considering the criteria of Consolidated, 
Controllable, Continuous, Clean, and Cheap (5C), and combining expert evaluation, local knowledge, and community-
based approaches, can be a key solution to addressing the challenges of renewable energy implementation. The 
findings of this study indicate that the developed decision-making framework has significant implications in 
overcoming the challenges of renewable energy implementation in remote areas like Southwest Sumba. This 
framework not only provides guidance for policymakers and energy planners in developing and implementing 
renewable energy projects but also emphasizes the importance of a thorough business feasibility study after selecting 
the best alternative model.

1. Introduction
Energy has a very important role in human life because almost all human activities depend on the availability of energy 
(Gyawali et al. 2020). Energy is needed to operate various lighting equipment, households, transportation, and 
industrial machines (Salvarli and Salvarli 2020). Therefore, every country must place energy as a strategic priority in 
its national development. Based on data from the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) in 2023, the growth of a country's

Abstract 
This research investigated the impact of internet applications on student satisfaction in higher education institutions. 
A quantitative survey approach was applied, and the results were analyzed by using Confirmatory Factor Analysis 
(CFA). A total of 254 students participated in this research to determine the student satisfaction level as well as examine 
the relation between factors. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to examine the relations between 
various factors in the conceptual model, which consisted of technological advancement, convenience, resources, 
internet facilities and student satisfaction. Two out of four hypotheses about the relations between the five factors were 
found to be supportive.  The research results provided a positive impact to internet 
applications 
in 
higher 
education institutions and reached maximum student satisfaction Also, the research was expected to widen the scope 
of managing internet applications in other universities and subsequently be expanded to the industries.

1. Introduction
To face the challenge of global competition in higher education, internet applications (wireless technology) deliver 
daily internet access to the education community (universities, colleges, institutions, and schools). Since universities 
and colleges have shifted to more online instruction in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, wireless technology has 
become essential for academician and students in delivering quality lectures and coursework, respectively. For 
example, students frequently apply newly acquired knowledge or abilities from the internet to improve their academic 
performance. However, misapplication of the internet for non-academic purposes is not limited, and excessive usage 
of internet can have negative effects on student academic performance. To improve students' educational experiences,

Though this research makes several valuable contributions, there are a few limitations that need to be considered in 
the future. These include the use of self-reported data, the sample size and representativeness, as well as the restricted 
focus area. Future studies can investigate additional factors, such as robust Wi-Fi that might increase students' desire 
to apply Wi-Fi more efficiently. Moreover, the research recommends the top management to further enhance internet 
applications in order to increase student satisfaction and loyalty in experiencing a better information technologies 
environment in the academic field.
