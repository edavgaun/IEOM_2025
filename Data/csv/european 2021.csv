Abstract  
The purpose of this paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of the indicators that have been used to measure 
industrial sustainability. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore indicators published in 
peer-reviewed articles that are relevant to industrial sustainability performance measurement. A total of 
1013 indicators were identified and analyzed: 277 for economic, 402 for environmental and 334 for social 
dimensions of industrial sustainability. The majority of the indicators were used only once, implying a lack 
of consistency and consensus on their application for measuring industrial sustainability, and invites an 
ongoing debate on how sustainability should be measured in different industry contexts. On the other hand, 
few indicators such as profit, research and development expenditure, product quality, revenue, material 
cost, labor cost, water consumption, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, material consumption, 
employment/job opportunity, employee turnover and work-related injuries were consistent and frequently 
used for measuring industrial sustainability. The consistent indicators have been used to measure industrial 
sustainability performance associated with financial benefits, costs, market competitiveness, resources, 
emissions, wastes, employees, customers, and the community. This paper provides a comprehensive view 
of indicators considering the triple bottom line dimensions of sustainability. It will contribute to future 
academic and practitioner work on the measurement of industrial sustainability performance.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, sustainable manufacturing is increasingly becoming a necessity to properly manage the environmental 
and social impacts of manufacturing industries (Ahmad and Wong, 2019; Singh S. et al., 2014). Manufacturing 
industries have a significant role in the sustainable development of society (Beekaroo et al., 2019; Moldavska 
Anastasiia and Welo, 2019). Since they play an active role in the consumption of natural resources, and the generation 
of emissions and wastes, they can significantly contribute to promoting sustainability (Hendiani et al., 2020). 
Sustainable manufacturing has become a key factor for manufacturing firms to exist in today’s competitive business 
environment (Singh R.K. et al., 2019). Thus, there is a need for transformation from traditional manufacturing 
practices that focus on economic benefits to state-of-the-art manufacturing that consider environmental and social 
responsibility in addition to pursuing economic benefits (Shuaib et al., 2014; Singh R.K. et al., 2019). For this purpose, 
manufacturing industries have taken steps to adopt sustainability into their short-term and long-term decision-making 
(Ahi and Searcy, 2015). Integrating sustainability practices in manufacturing industries requires a holistic approach 
covering products, manufacturing processes and systems. The scope varies from the production line to plant, firm and  
supply chain (Huang and Badurdeen, 2018). Industrial sustainability refers to the adoption of sustainability practices 
at the firm level (Trianni Andrea et al., 2017). 
The most widely applied definition of sustainable manufacturing is provided by the US Department of Commerce, 
which defined it as “the creation of a manufactured product with processes that have minimal negative impact on the 
environment, conserve energy and natural resources, are safe for employees and communities, and are economically 
sound” (Ahmad and Wong, 2019; Joung et al., 2013). The definition of sustainable manufacturing addresses economic, 
environmental and social aspects of sustainability. Elkington (1997) proposed the triple bottom line (TBL) approach

Abstract 
 
Transportation modes, as part of the freight distribution system, have a vital role in the sending of parcels from 
consignor to consignee. In Indonesia, transportation activities between cities or provinces are dominated by trucks 
which cause road damage and congestion; this has implications in terms of the freight distribution bottlenecks. By 
contrast, trains have greater capacity, time delivery certainty, and cost-efficiency. However, trains only cover the 
freight distribution from station to station, which necessitates the double handling process; this means that the 
consignors-consignees must place and pick up the parcels at the train station. The lack of connectivity causes logistics 
service providers (LSPs) and consumers to choose trucks for freight distribution. Thus, this study proposes the 
framework of integrated freight distribution systems using a case study approach. This study highlights technology as 
a tool for integrating freight distribution services for all stakeholders, including the train company, retailers, and LSPs. 
Process synchronization and information sharing among stakeholders must be encouraged to produce seamless 
distribution performance.

Abstract 
 
Despite its large popularity, the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method has been the object of numerous studies 
addressing the problem of the assessment and prioritization of customer requirements. Nevertheless, a comparative 
analysis of these approaches to investigate their practical usability is scarcely discussed. This paper aims at filling this 
gap by means of a practical case study at a manufacturer in the food sector, where five of the most common approaches 
used to augment the House of Quality (HoQ) were analyzed and the results were compared. To achieve such a goal, 
semi-structured questionnaires were developed to capture consumers’ preferences and expectations. The outputs of 
this study contribute to a better understanding of the potential and limitations of the examined approaches in order to 
address practitioners and companies in decision-making processes and resources allocation. Moreover, the article can 
serve as a reference for further investigations in the development of food products, where both intrinsic and extrinsic 
qualities need to be addressed.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays the globalized market, as well as the ever-increasing speed of companies in putting new products on the 
market, are making profitability and competitiveness more difficult for companies. Improving the quality of their 
products is a challenging task for engineers who have to balance the need to satisfy the customers’ expectations with 
the company’s bottom line (Haber et al. 2018). This is particularly true for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises 
(SMEs), which have difficulties in dealing with such issues, in addition to taking into account laws and regulations, 
e.g. health, safety and environmental requirements (Taticchi et al. 2010; Dror et al. 2012; Munir et al. 2014; Lombardi 
and Fargnoli 2017). The capability of a product to satisfy certain requisites in an appropriate way before its market-
launch represents a key factor in product development activities. As noted by Burke et al. (2002), if decision-makers 
articulate what a customer requirement means ineffectively, an incorrect assessment of the importance of that demand 
occurs. In such a context, the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method (Akao 1990) plays a primary role in 
assessing and improving the quality of a product or service before it is put on the market. In details, it facilitates the 
decision-making process allowing manufacturers a better understanding of the needs and expectations of the customers 
as to translate them into technical characteristics. The traditional QFD method is based on a four-phase approach 
(Figure 1) able to satisfy customers by translating their demands into design targets and quality assurance points. 
The core of the method is the set of matrices called the “House of Quality” (HoQ), that is based on a cause-effect 
mechanism, which relates the Customer Requirements (CRs) (the so-called “whats”) with Engineering Characteristics 
(ECs) (the so-called “hows”) by means of a relationship matrix (Fargnoli and Sakao 2017). Additionally, the 
assessment of the “hows” is provided (obtaining the so-called “how-muches”), while mutual comparisons can be 
carried out by a correlation matrix (“the roof of the house”), as well as a benchmarking analysis (Figure 2).Despite its 
large diffusion, the QFD has been criticized for some weaknesses mainly due to the assessment criteria used in the 
HoQ, that can lead both to an erroneous evaluation of the qualitative characteristics and attributes, as well as to their 
incorrect prioritization (Chen et al. 2013; Vinayak and Kodali 2013; Zhang et al. 2015). As remarked by Kannan 
(2008), the inherent vagueness and impreciseness of the traditional HoQ is mainly due to: the type of inputs, which 
are often provided in the form of linguistic data; the impreciseness in translating qualitative CRs into ECs; and the 
resulting vagueness in defining the correlation measures among ECs.

78","Nevertheless, other tools can certainly be found, such as the Design Structure Matrix (DSM) and the Domain Mapping 
Matrix (DMM) (Eppinger and Browning 2012), the Axiomatic Design (Carnevalli et al. 2010), the Spherical fuzzy 
QFD (SF-QFD) (Gündoğdu and Kahraman 2020), or the Hesitant Fuzzy QFD (Onar et al. 2016). Moreover, since the 
study was carried out in the food sector, the “qualitative” nature of the parameters used in the HoQ makes the 
assessment of their interdependencies more difficult (Benner et al., 2003). Thus, a larger number of customers 
involved in the study can provide more precise results, especially when using the ANP and the Thurstone’s LCJ 
approaches.  
5. Conclusions 
Despite its global diffusion and large use, the QFD methods present some limitations especially concerning the 
evaluation and the prioritization of customers’ needs. This article proposed a comparative analysis of some of the most 
well-known approaches that are used to address such a problem utilizing a practical case study at a company operating 
in the food sector. The results achieved have brought to light the different potentials of such approaches in maximizing 
the benefits of the HoQ and reducing its “softness”, which mainly relies on the difficulties arising from the dependency 
on the human assessment abilities, i.e. the problem of transforming qualitative judgments into quantitative values by 
means of an ordinal scale. In summary, our study provides practical insights in addressing the use of the HoQ and 
several of its supporting approaches to better understand and prioritize customers’ needs through a case-based 
research. Accordingly, the article can serve as a reference for further investigations in the food products’ development, 
where both intrinsic and extrinsic qualities need to be addressed. However, to reduce the above-mentioned limitations 
further research work is needed. In particular, the application of the proposed approach in a different context, as well 
as its implementation with the support of a larger number of questionnaires (i.e. more customers involved) can 
certainly help in improving the validity of our practical findings.

Abstract 
 
Proper management of inventories within any company is important because  they represent an asset with  considerable 
investment and mishandling  generates waste. Within the  types of  inventories, there are raw  materials takes, which  
require greater control,  since   their proper planning  depends on the subsequent activities of the supply chain. By 
making a situational diagnosis at the company under study it was determined that there were economic losses due to 
inventory obsolescence  in the warehouse, delays in deliveries which led to fines and claims, demonstrating the need 
to apply an inventory  model that allows to reduce its costs and meet delivery deadlines. It starts by classifying 
inventories according to their level of importance with respect to the level of sales, in order to determine which of 
them are the most demanded by customers. The dispersion of the data is analyzed to form the database and look for 
outliers. The demand forecast was made with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and R Version 
3.6.2, specifically with the package nnfor for neural networks. For the planning of the stock keeping unit (SKU) it is 
done with the models Silver Meal (SM), Wagner Whitin (WW) Fragmented Period Balance (BFP); determining an 
optimal result with a reduction of 57,89%, compared to the value of placing a monthly order during the period.

1. Introduction 
Within any company, the management of inventories is considered as one of the most important administrative 
functions since it encompasses the management of raw material, in-process product, and finished product; considering 
that inventories account for a good part of the capital and can have an impact in areas such as production, marketing, 
and finance, they also influence the achievement of the company's overall objectives. (Schroeder, 2011). Focusing on 
the cost of inventories and that mishandling would lead to significant losses, not-so-reliable options are proposed as 
opting for a minimum inventory to lower costs and reduce loss of obsolescence or maintain excess inventory to meet 
all demands, avoiding fines for non-compliance and lost sales; proving that the challenge is not in reducing costs with 
a minimum or a maximum of inventory, but in maintaining the right amount for the company to reach its competitive 
priorities efficiently. (Krajewski, 2008). In the market we find services and asset processing companies, in which, 
regardless of their business, they will need an inventory; for the realization of this work is proposed as a case study to 
a company dedicated to the production and marketing of chemicals; because of its commercial activity much of the 
company's capital is invested in raw materials, forcing the company to investigate ways to properly manage its 
resources, thus seeking to maintain production times and avoiding the dissatisfaction of the Customers.

4. Conclusion 
1. With the theoretical basis and fundamentals in inventory management, specifically with the heuristic models 
for inventory planning was achieved stent the model application  that best suits the company under study. 
2. The ABC classification of inventories allowed to establish the SKU that generate the most sales,  conformers 
by 78,82%, 16,66% and 4,62% of categories A, B and C, respectively. 
3. The forecasting data showed high dispersion in orders, leading to the application of  heuristic methods.  
4. Forecasting demand over neural networks  provided an average MSE of 0,0075, allowing to create a forecast 
closer to the reality of the company. 
5. From the application of the Silver Meal, Wagner Whitin and Fragmented Period Balance inventory models 
resulted in a total inventory cost of $3 788,94, $3 706,68, and $3,831.43 respectively; from the contrast of 
the three models, Wagner Whitin's  method presented the largest savings, with  57,89%.

Abstract 
 
Today, fulfilling customer needs is no longer a dilemma for service providers within the context of growing many 
inventions and achievements related to innovative technology. Increasing digitalization has allowed businesses to 
meet every individual requirement by helping them easily own the customer's information and to deliver service with 
faster time and more accuracy. In consequence, both customer satisfaction and service quality will be increasingly 
determined by innovative digital technology. 
This paper aims to modify a Service Quality model for the present context, where both humans and technology are 
making an effort to fulfil customer needs in order to further enhance the overall service quality and customer 
satisfaction. For this purpose, this research will combine the frameworks of Parasuraman et al. (1988) (SERVQUAL) 
and Marfo-Yiadom & Ansong (2012) (Innovative Product Quality), as an Innovative Service Quality measurement. 
The results of a survey were collected from 222 retail banking customers in Vietnam, being processed by the SPSS 
program through Cronbach's alpha test, correlation and regression analysis. 
As the result, the study confirmed the positive relationship between Service Quality from humans and innovative 
technology, in which Responsiveness from the staff and Security and Flexibility from innovative technology is 
influential for Customer Satisfaction.

Abstract 
 
Due to the ever-increasing amount of industrial waste, illegal dumpsites have been spreading out both in well-being 
and developing countries. Therefore, research and remediation programs have been promoted worldwide in order to 
limit the negative impact on both the environment and public health of uncontrolled waste disposal. Accordingly, a 
great attention has been paid to environmental aspects of remediation activities in contaminated sites and a consistent 
legislative framework to deal with environmental concerns was stated. However, in such a context occupational health 
and safety (OHS) issues related to the operators that have to deal with the remediation activities of this type of sites 
are not considered sufficiently. As a matter of fact, planning suitable safety measures to prevent workers from injuries 
and professional diseases is essential. That is particularly true during the characterization activities, when workers can 
be subjected to the direct contact with the polluted environment and are not completely aware about the pollution’s 
entity and type. Hence, this study aims at reducing such a gap, providing a general framework to plan safety during 
characterization activities, starting from a case-study and the analysis of ISO 45001 approach.

1. Introduction and literature review 
In last decades, the growing industrial activity worldwide has brought a better welfare state for people and, 
consequently, an increasing consumption of goods and services, with a large production of waste (Singh et al., 2014). 
However, the increasing production of waste has often resulted in bad disposal practices, such as open dumpsites and 
uncontrolled/illegal landfills, especially in low-income countries (Kaza, S.; Yao, L.; Bhada-Tata, P.; Van Woerden, 
2018). 
According to the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), the expression “illegal dumping” is referred to “Waste 
materials that have been dumped, tipped or otherwise deposited onto land where no licence or approval exists to accept 
such waste. Illegal dumping varies from small bags of rubbish in an urban environment to larger scale dumping of 
waste materials in isolated areas, such as bushland” (EPA, 2015). Illegal waste dumps take place in secluded areas, 
such as forest areas or unfenced private plots, or near water courses, waste management plants, wastelands, roadsides 
etc. (Malinowski et al., 2015; Senior & Mazza, 2004). In many developing countries open dumping sites are often very 
close to urban areas because they can be a “working place” for waste pickers (O’ Hare, 2019).

126",,"This output can be considered a step forward to sustainable management of safety in such contaminated sites, as 
required by Agenda ONU 2030 through the 8th Sustainable Development Goal. However, this study has to be 
considered an initial step of a more comprehensive approach to deal with OHS issues in industrial contaminated sites. 
Hence, further research is needed to complete it considering the other phases of the PDCA approach. Additionally, 
another improvement opportunity relies on the application of resilience engineering principles, which aim to build a 
strong response of the system to disruptions, instead to focus on identifying and alleviating risk factors (Li et al., 
2019).

Abstract 
 
The introduction of Industry 4.0 and the associated digital transformation present great challenges for many 
companies. Such a project poses a danger to companies insofar as the technologies themselves are very 
often available and applicable, but their successful introduction requires great skill in change management. 
At the same time, companies and their manufacturing systems should be designed in such a way that they 
are successful in the marketplace for the long term. At present, there are already efforts in the direction of 
methods, roadmaps and strategies for the introduction of Industry 4.0. However, only a few of these 
methods explicitly deal with the long-term sustainable implementation of Industry 4.0.. Therefore, the aim 
of this work is an analysis of current methods for the introduction of Industry 4.0, which focuses on long-
term sustainability in the redesign of systems. A systematic literature review provides a methodology for 
identifying relevant work in the scientific literature. Subsequently, the methods found are compared with 
each other and limits and gaps in the literature are discussed. 
 
Keywords 
Industry 4.0, Sustainability, Industry 4.0 Roadmap, Systematic Literature Review 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In recent years, the industrial environment has been changing radically due to the introduction of concepts and 
technologies based on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Sendler, 2013) or better known as “Industry 4.0” or I4.0. The 
focus of Industry 4.0 is to combine production, information technology and the internet. Thus, with Industry 4.0, 
innovative advanced manufacturing technologies are combined with information and communication technologies to 
increase the level of digitalization of operational and business processes. Regardless of the size of a company, an 
appropriate digital transformation strategy offers future opportunities for growth and sustainable competitiveness on 
a global market. Today many companies still struggle in implementing new technologies related to Industry 4.0, 
Internet of Things and Smart Manufacturing. Furthermore, a challenge for many companies is to introduce these new 
technologies in a thoughtful way in order to not risk the long-term sustainability. Therefore, there is a need for 
strategies and methods to support firms in introducing Industry 4.0 while keeping in mind long-term sustainability of 
the company.  
In this article, we want to analyze the suitability of already existing methods in scientific literature regarding the long-
term sustainability for introducing Industry 4.0. After defining the research question, we propose a systematic 
literature review as a research methodology. Subsequently we show the procedure we conducted to analyze scientific

138","that are sustainable.. In the authors opinion, only such a procedure can lead finally to design solutions that aim not 
only to digitalize production, but also to make enterprises more sustainable and resilient.  
We are starting a research initiative titled “Sustainable Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) 4.0 – Development of a 
Methodology for the Long-Term Introduction of Industry 4.0 to Sustain SMEs” where we give a certain focus to small 
and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) as they often struggle in the implementation of Industry 4.0. 
 
6. Conclusions  
 
In this contribution, we analyzed the scientific literature regarding the methods and tools for a long-term sustainable 
introduction of Industry 4.0. According to the research question, we looked into scientific works, in our case Scopus 
database, to find methods that already deal with the introduction of Industry 4.0 to sustain SMEs. At this moment, we 
have to clarify that, the study is not about investigating how to implement sustainability in Industry 4.0, but much 
more how to implement Industry 4.0 in companies so that companies are more sustainable!. Based on the advantages 
of SLR for this study we selected SLR as the research methodology. By using the SLR approach, we identified 13 
works that propose methods and frameworks to improve the way of introducing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing. The 
content analysis and results of this investigation showed us, that there are several concepts and methods that, each by

approach for designing and implementing small and medium manufacturing enterprises that are sustainable for the 
long-term. In the future, this lack in scientific literature should be closed by developing a methodology within the

Abstract 
The demand for quality in products and services has required companies to make great efforts to stand out in the 
market. World-Class Manufacturing (WCM) seeks to boost these efforts by applying a set of tools associated with 
continuous improvement processes, making companies unique in their markets. This study explores the impacts of the 
WCM method on production processes, when related to technologies aimed at industry 4.0. It uses a multiple case 
approach, for three market players, from totally different sectors: pharmaceutical, commodities and energy. The 
analyzes suggest that the use of technologies from industry 4.0 with the WCM method can impact on production 
processes, helping to develop continuous improvement practices that affect the strategic results of companies.

Abstract 
Increased digital readiness and use of digital technologies in business organizations in a variety of applications and 
processes are affecting how businesses innovate and perform in the new large-scale competitiveness age. Businesses 
are recognizing the importance of their ability to adapt to changes following knowledge revolutions, social networks 
and digital applications, in order to maintain an attainable and/or sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). 
 
The study focused on a central question of how businesses can integrate a digital strategy initiative and plans to 
improve firm performance in terms on innovativeness capabilities. Contemporary research suggests that the well-
known ICT-Business strategic alignment method among traditional information technologies and business operations 
is not sufficient to create an SCA or to form improved firm performance.  
 
A structural equations modeling techniques operated to empirically construct a model and analyze a data set obtained 
from the Israeli industrial sector. It examines how this sector is affected by digital technologies and trends, create 
digital strategies and transformation programs, and how digital alignment corresponds with traditional ICT-business 
alignment. Results show significant validation of the structural model while at the same time sharpen the differences 
between the two concepts due to the ambiguity that exists in the literature and industry. The study also points to 
differences between senior or executive level managers who refer more impact to Technology Alignment over Digital 
Alignment while low ranking or younger managers tend to perceive digital alignment as a more powerful for gaining 
firm performance. 
 
Finally, the study delineates several similarities and differences factors that can serve as value drivers for researchers 
and practitioners to develop synchronous ICT and digital alignments strategies, and outline on a possible framework 
to achieve ICT and digital alignments for new firm performed innovation.

Abstract 
 
With the rapid growth in e-commerce and virtual markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic, customer satisfaction due 
to logistics activities has become more imperative than ever. The Traveling Repairman Problem (TRP), which is also 
known as the cumulative traveling salesman problem, the deliveryman problem and the minimum latency problem, is 
a special variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). All these problems differ in their objective function 
criteria.  In TSP, the total cost (distance or time) of the salesman is minimized. In the case of the TRP, the total latency 
(waiting time or delay time) of all customers is minimized. Ultimately, with TRP, customer satisfaction is maximized 
through minimizing the total latency. 
 
This paper focuses on a generalized version of TRP with multi depots and time windows, namely Multi Depot 
Traveling Repairman Problem with Time Windows (MDTRPTW). A group of homogeneous repairmen initiate and 
finish their visit tours at depots. Each customer must be visited exactly by one repairman within their provided earliest 
end latest times, defined as their time windows.  To the best of our knowledge, there is no study in the literature on 
this problem. In this paper, in addition to posing the problem, we propose a mixed integer programming model for 
MDTRPTW with O(n2) integer decision variables and O(n2) constraints. MDTRPTW is an NP-hard challenging 
combinatorial optimization problem. In order to find near optimal solutions within a reasonable computational time 
for realistic sized dimensions, we also propose a biogeography-based optimization algorithm as a metaheuristic 
approach. The performance of our formulation and metaheuristic are analyzed by solving instances with time windows 
from other problems in the literature that are adapted for MDTRPTW. We observe that our proposed formulation is 
able to solve small and moderate size problems in reasonable times. The efficacy of the metaheuristic solution 
approach is evaluated in terms of solution quality as well as computation time. The developed metaheuristic approach 
is able to solve problems with 300 customers within seconds. Moreover, when contrasted with the exact solution 
methodology, the proposed metaheuristic algorithm represents a high performance to find good quality solutions 
within acceptable CPU times for large-size problems. The main contribution of this paper is to define and to present 
a mathematical model for the multi depot Traveling Repairman Problem with time windows. In addition, to propose 
a metaheuristic approach for this problem.

Abstract 
 
This paper made an inquiry to whether dividend-paying firms are more efficient compared to their non-dividend 
paying counterparts. To achieve the same, we have employed a non-parametric frontier estimation technique, data 
envelopment analysis (DEA), on the selected dataset of 73 firms from the textile industry in India. Our result 
shows that non-dividend-paying firms are 11.17% less efficient in their performance compared to dividend-paying 
firms. Further analysis indicates that efficient firms have better corporate governance compared to inefficient non-
dividend-paying firms. Furthermore, the non-parametric test “ Kruskal-Wallis” reveals that there is a significant 
difference of about 5.15 % between “high corporate governance dividend paying firms” compared to “low 
corporate governance non-dividend paying firms”.

1. Introduction 
Dividend income for a shareholder outrightly competes with capital gains in terms of its return on investments. 
However, in the presence of tax on dividend income which is usually higher than the tax on capital gains 
worldwide, researchers argue that ceteris paribus, a rational firm, should not payout dividends (Collins and 
Kemsley, 2000). Instead, returns through capital gains maximize shareholders' wealth. But, in the presence of 
market imperfections, especially agency problems and information asymmetry between different stakeholders, 
dividend payout adds to the firm’s value (Li and Zhao, 2008; Brockman and Unlu, 2009; Lin, Chen and Tsai, 
2017). 
 
Researchers argue that dividend payout reduces agency problems between different stakeholders (Rozeff, 1982; 
Easterbrook, 1984) and thus adds to a firm's value. The insiders of a firm (owner-manager) have better knowledge 
about the firm’s expected future cash flows compared to the outsiders (marginal investors). In this environment 
of information asymmetry, and in the absence of any information-revealing mechanism, marginal investors fail to 
predict a firm's true value (Miller and Rock, 1985; Fosu et al., 2016). Dividend payout under such circumstances 
is expected to reduce this information asymmetry regarding firm’s value between insiders and outsiders (Miller 
and Rock, 1985; Lin, Chen and Tsai, 2017).    
 
If a payout activity reduces agency costs and information asymmetry between different stakeholders, the firm’s 
performance is expected to be high compared to non-payers. Therefore, one should find a direct association 
between the firm’s payout activity and its performance. In this study, we test the hypothesis that firms paying 
dividends are more efficient in terms of performance than their non-dividend counterparts.

(depicting the density plot of the firms). Firms not paying dividends are skewed towards the left and comparatively 
more flattered to those who are paying dividends. 
 
 
Figure 1: Density plot of dividend and non-dividend paying firms 
 
 
Furthermore, the role of corporate governance was also investigated to gauge whether it affects the firms' 
performance or not? To do so, we computed an indicator of corporate governance practices indicating the 
compositions of independent directors within a firm. On average, it was found that firms with high levels of 
corporate governance and paying dividends are likely to be 5% more efficient than the firms with low corporate 
governance levels and not paying dividends. See Figure 2.  
 
 
Figure 2: Technical efficiency of dividend and non-dividend paying firms. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Empirical studies in different countries' contexts show that dividend payout reduces agency cost and information 
asymmetry between different stakeholders. A firm with lower agency conflicts and a lower information 
asymmetry between different stakeholders should perform better compared to the others. We find that this is 
indeed the case, and dividend-paying firms have better efficiency (with a mean difference of 11.17%) compared 
to their non-dividend counterparts. Further test results show that a dividend-paying firm with better corporate 
governance performs better in terms of efficiency (with a mean difference of 5.15%) compared to their non-
dividend paying firms with poor corporate governance. Strangely, the mean difference between dividend and non-
dividend paying firms have reduced when the corporate governance indicator is also factored in (mean difference 
between the two groups reduces from 11.17% to 5.15%). The probable explanation for this may be that a) either 
the effect of corporate governance has been suppressed by the effect of payout policy on firm performance or, b) 
the effect of corporate governance on firm performance is opposite to what is expected. But one has to dig this 
question further before reaching any conclusion. We leave this question open-ended for a future analysis on this 
observation.

Abstract  
 
One of the ways to solve the problem of environmental protection in the fuel/metallurgical sectors of the economy is 
the introduction of new complex technological processes, which can be implemented by the principle of energy-
chemical-technological processing of carbon raw materials. It involves the extraction of valuable chemical 
components in the form of coke oven gas, benzene hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulphide, coal tar, ammonia, as well as 
the production of solid product with new properties. 
 
A technology for the production of smokeless solid fuel from a mixture of gas coal (80%) and coal wastes (20%) has 
been developed. Comparative studies of the kinetics of combustion have been carried; the dependence of the rate of 
interaction of coke residues of anthracite, highly metamorphosed coal, low-metamorphosed coal and smokeless solid 
fuel with oxygen of air was obtained. The characteristics of anthracite, high-metamorphosed coal, low-metamorphosed 
coal and smokeless solid fuel combustion dynamics are obtained, which allow further determination of the reactivity 
of the carbonaceous substance of the fuel.  
 
The developed technology of production of smokeless carbon fuel offers the opportunity to use carbon wastes and 
improve environmental performance. According to the results of industrial experiments, the optimal quality indicators 
of smokeless solid fuels recommended for ferroalloy industries were established at ferroalloy enterprises.

According to the results of performed laboratory, experimental and pilot studies of 
smokeless solid fuel, the requirements for its quality indicators have been developed for its usage 
in gasification technologies, production of sugar, soda, cement, during limestone 
burning/calcination. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
The technology of production of smokeless carbon fuel has been developed during this 
research work. The result of the processing is lumpy carbon fuel, which has a homogeneous solid 
structure, high combustion and mechanical strength, high reactivity, high speed and complete 
combustion of the fuel particles. Proposed technology offers the opportunity to reutilise carbon 
wastes and improve environmental indicators of the air pollution. 
Smokeless lumpy carbon fuel has several advantages over other types of fuel: combustion 
of fuel particles in high-temperature zones − more than 8000C – transfer combustion mode to a 
phase close to exterior diffusion. Based on the obtained experimental/industrial results, the 
optimum quality indicators of smokeless solid fuels recommended for ferroalloy industries were 
established and successfully tasted.

Abstract 
 
The increasing quest for market share and efficiency in today’s banking sector is adding to the complexity 
to that particular industry. This work aims to explore and model customer adoption behaviour on mobile 
banking using a systems thinking approach, in particular, qualitative modelling using causal loop diagrams. 
This method has been integrated with a grounded theory approach to identify the variables and their 
relationships from the literature review of relevant studies. The relationships between the variables were 
used to draw up causal loop diagrams. Five different perspectives were drawn from the literature to develop 
the diagrams through several iterations and discussions. The diagrams were brought together and analyzed 
to provide a proposal for effectively managing adoption in the mobile banking industry.   
 
Keywords 
Technology Adoption, Innovation, Systems Thinking, Causal-loop Diagrams and Mobile Banking. 
 
 1. Introduction 
The banking industry is rapidly changing by the influence of many other industries, such as mobile technology, 
wireless technology and the Internet. Mobile banking technology now tends to become a mature technology and 
technology is mass adopted by customers in many places all over the world. The emerging new banking product like 
internet banking is in the early stages in the market. The current market for internet banking is relatively small because 
of its low level of consumer awareness. However, this new technology should not be underestimated. In many 
European countries, while 85% of consumers are not aware of the internet banking initiative, almost 43% would 
welcome the internet banking services (Mastercard 2017). The emergence of new technology is changing customer 
needs and customer behavior in many different ways, such as decreased customer attention, the need for 
personalization, and the increasing customer expectations (Mansoor 2017). Meanwhile, for every company in the 
market, only higher profit margins can bring profit, which needs to be gained by acquisition of greater and steadier 
market share (Abbasi et al. 2016). Therefore, attracting more customers are key for them to growth and profitability. 
The customer acceptance model, such as Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Diffusion of Innovation (DIO), 
Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), were used in previous research to help banking 
system with a new product or new function to attract the customers (Abbasi et al. 2016). However, most of the research 
solves the problem only form single perspective. Customer’s adoption behavior on mobile banking system is a 
complex system which involves many different perspectives, such as social influence, economic consideration, and 
mental model. A model from a single perspective is not enough to better understand the diffusion process. Therefore, 
it is essential to consider the problems from different perspectives. Besides, those static models only suggest how 
technology attract new customers and cannot guarantee a long-term profit. It is a fact that after launching the new 
product, the monopoly of the new product will not be long-term (Abbasi, 2016). The traditional linear thinking can 
only attract the first customers. Businesses need not only attracting the first customers but also keeping the customer 
in hand, including mobile banking. By using systems thinking approach, the causal loop diagram is helpful for the 
business to develop sustainably and to maintain the market share. Therefore, the study uses systems thinking approach 
to solve the problem in different perspectives and to sustainable develop the mobile banking adoption.

Abstract 
 
‘Category management’ term has been used in manufacturing companies for over 10 years, but its methodology has 
not been clearly defined yet. Traditional category management (CM) originated in retail and it is obvious that the 
whole set of its tools is impossible to apply to the purchases of industrial companies due to a number of specific 
restrictions: some of the goods purchased by a manufacturing enterprise are modified in the process of production, 
and the others are acquired not for external, but for the needs of company internal consumer. Therefore, it is necessary 
to make a number of clarifications in the methodology of CM for manufacturing companies concerning the process 
framework, toolkit and implementation guidelines. In this regard, we proposed a fundamentally new concept of 
‘category approach’. By analyzing the theory of traditional CM, the practice of manufacturing CM and summarizing 
the experience of Russian industrial companies we outline the methodology of ‘category approach’ and its toolkit and 
implement these findings in a big Russian  metallurgical company. The questions that arouse in the course of 
implementation made us develop a new strategic decision-making tool, which was successfully tested during the 
project. 
 
Keywords 
Supply management, category management, purchasing category management, category approach. 
 
1. Introduction 
Procurement function of industrial enterprises has been underestimated and viewed as a service function for a long 
period. But over the last decade, raising efficiency of a supply management process becomes a priority for many 
companies worldwide, for investments here are relatively low and quick to return. According to KPMG study, ‘The 
Purchasing Maturity Model. Analysis of the procurement function in Russian companies’ 1, the share of goods 
purchased in the revenues of production plants makes from 25 to 65%. For example, in the steel industry their cost is 
65%, in chemical 61%, in heavy industry - 42%. Purchases have a decisive impact on the financial result of a company, 
as a purchase cost reduction of 10% can lead to a double increase in profits. KPMG estimates that the potential to 
reduce the cost of purchasing in Russian companies is about 10-15%. 
 
Data collected by KPMG-Russia confirm that it is economically expedient to search for a reserve to improve 
competitiveness in reducing procurement costs. According to KPMG experts, the most important issues in developing 
procurement function of Russian enterprises are strategy, improving the process of sourcing and implementation of 
category management.  The major question that arises is what exactly category management means for manufacturing 
companies?  The practice of category management was originally developed and used in retail enterprises in order to 
manage the assortment of goods sold. There is a gap in theoretical basis for category management and its 
implementation in manufacturing, lack of academic literature about its methodology, toolkit, guidelines. All these are 
the reasons why CM is a costly and unique knowledge offered by consulting agencies, hardly available for small and

206","To select a supplier on two disparate scales, we will use the Kraljic Matrix (Figure 2). According to the adapted matrix 
received, the S3 supplier is not profitable, but safe. So the choice was made between suppliers S4 and S11, and it was 
decided to divide between them supply volumes to secure risks.  
 
Figure 3. Strategic Supplier Selection Matrix 
 
The developed methodology includes a multi-criteria assessment of suppliers and a strategic assessment of the Kraljic 
matrix. It will avoid biased assessment of financial factors, expand the range of parameters assessed to those 
enterprises that focus only on price comparison, and introduce an element of strategic evaluation of alternatives in the 
decision-making of the choice of supplier, and thus move from the operational function of choosing a supplier based 
on a multicriteria or TCO model to the level of strategic sourcing (Burlakova 2021). 
6. Conclusion  
 
Marketing tools used in retail CM are not appropriate for applying category approach in manufacturing companies 
effectively. It is necessary to have specially developed process framework, tools, guidelines and templates. We 
developed CM process framework and toolkit that helped us implement category approach in a big Russian 
metallurgical company, which led to considerable savings opportunity. Russian companies do have some specific 
PSM features, and its supply markets differ from those of other countries, but the methodology developed is based on 
general purchasing and CM theory, so it can be applied universally. During the project we found that some existing 
managerial tools, like Kraljic matrix, need to be adopted for industrial companies use: made more formalized, 
quantified. There is also necessity to formalize justification of strategic solutions. So we developed a new quantified 
supplier selection model based on Kraljic matrix, that combines risk assessment and cost reduction objectives. The 
model was tested on one category, which led to the most considerable savings. Probably some new tools should be 
developed specially for category approach in manufacturing companies.

Abstract 
 
Pasar Turi is one of the names of the train station located in the city of Surabaya. This station has been established 
since the Dutch colonial era. The problem is the limited capacity for now. The number of train passengers using 
motorized vehicles requires available parking. The purpose of this study is to determine the performance of 
capacities two and four. The method used in this study is a direct survey at the observation site. The results of the 
study are the parking patterns used are 900 angle patterns and 600 angle patterns for cars while motorcycle 00 angle 
patterns. The most accumulated parking for motorbikes on Sunday is 338 vehicles and cars with 96 vehicles. The 
time duration for the car is shorter, 3:32:26 while the motorcycle is 4:45:36. For Turnover Parking on motorbikes 
0.03518 Vehicles / plots / hour and for cars 0.0763333 Vehicles / plots / hour. For parking indexes at maximum 
conditions, for motor vehicles 65% and 77% cars. This shows that parking performance can still accommodate 
vehicles.

Abstract 
 
In this work, we present a stochastic mixed-integer programming model to optimize the sizes of two different kinds 
of energy storage systems and the capacity of the transmission lines for an island system. We consider an island where 
the main generation source is wind and alternative source is diesel.  The primary aim of this study is to investigate the 
investment decisions in storage and to determine energy capacities and power rates of the storage systems while 
minimizing the construction, O&M, and diesel costs. By deploying two different storage types at different places, we 
investigate the circumstances where installation decisions change. Stochastic renewable energy generation and 
demand are taken into account by considering different scenarios which are reproduced based on real data. First-order 
Markov chain is used to generate monthly wind power time series. Numerical experiments are conducted to investigate 
the effect of the cost parameters on the system design.

Abstract  
 
The research was developed a machine and tool workshop, which arises from the need to carry out facility 
layout problem (FLP) for two new production lines. The main objective is to optimize the path of the work 
object through the production departments, achieving a reduction of the total cost of transport, by applying 
distribution methods in the plant. It began with the research of the theoretical foundation analyzing the 
existing methodologies about the optimization of plant distribution, applied in productive organizations. 
The   workstations, as well as the necessary infrastructure, are identified in the production process with the 
dimensions of the workshop. A proposed plant distribution with a U-shaped material flow is developed due 
to the physical constraints of the workshop, complying with plant distribution principles and occupational 
safety and health standards for workers. Through the Systematic Layout Planning method and the Computer 
Relationship Design Planning method for each production line, considering that the main reason for 
relationship and closeness between departments is the productive flow. To contrast the results, the 
Computed Relative Allocation of Facilities method was applied to calculate the total cost of transport of 
the work object journey that was obtained from the distribution for each of the production lines.

1. Introduction 
The proper distribution of spaces and areas of work in a company has as its main objective to order the industrial 
elements so that the production processes are carried out in a fluid, efficient and that they are met in the scheduled 
time, reducing the occupational accident risks, optimizing production flow, improving employee mobility and 
increasing productivity, as (Vallhonrat & Corominas, 2010 ). The advantages of using appropriate plant distributions 
include reducing economic losses, avoiding large distances for the transfer of materials and tools, division of personnel 
in work areas, improving product quality by reducing process response times, as proposed (Cuatrecasas, 2012). The 
design should be simple to facilitate the distribution of the areas within the organization in order to provide better 
service and correct communication (Vallhonrat & Corominas, 2010 ). Prevents or minimizes occupational diseases 
and accidents, increasing productivity as processes are met on schedule, properly distributing materials, tools, and 
machines so that they are in the places they are needed and thus do not have to move them from long distances (Salazar, 
2016). Integrating people, tools, activities, and processes reducing distances, using all spaces, providing safety and 
tranquility to workers is the purpose of distribution (Obregón, 2016). The contribution in Plant consists of the physical 
management of the factors and industrial elements that participate in the production process of the company, in the 
distribution of the area, in the determination of the relative figures and the location of the different departments. The 
main objective is that this provision of elements is efficient and carried out in a way that contributes satisfactorily to 
the achievement of the purposes established in the company, in addition the distribution in the plant allows the ordering 
of industrial elements such as materials, machines, equipment, devices, tools, workers, production spaces, storage and

Based on the proposal for plant distribution of the workshop and the production flow of both production lines, the 
route diagram was developed, as shown in figure 8. The diagram indicates the way forward, to produce the products 
Pressure Vessels and Heat Exchangers. The development of the diagram was checked the organization and distribution 
of the production departments, according to the production flow, allowing the reduction of the total cost of transport

4. Conclusions 
1. The study of the art was carried out to define the methods applicable for the solution of the problem of 
distribution in the plant of the workshop of machines and tools to optimize the available space; achieving the 
integration of the whole of the workforce, means of work and object of work. 
2. For the proposed plant distribution of the  production lines a U-shaped material flow was used due to the 
physical constraints of the space available in the workshops.   
3. The plant distribution proposal developed by the application of the SLP method and validated by the 
CORELAP method, complies with the principles of plant distribution, allowing the optimization of the 
production flow, considering the commuter relationships between departments where the production flow is 
the main cause or cause of relationship.

of transporting the work object route across the production lines, obtaining that for the production line 
Pressure Vessels comes at a cost of $768,00 per month and for the production line of Heat Exchangers 
presents a cost of $1394,00 per month per month.

Abstract  
 
The progressing digitalization not only has an impact on the technical infrastructure of companies but also on the 
implementation of improvement projects. Six Sigma is a well-tried and widely spread method for structured 
conduction of improvement projects. The structured approach is due to the division into the phases Define, Measure, 
Analyze, Improve and Control. It is assumed that digitalization will have differently pronounced impacts on these 
phases. For this, the purpose of this paper is to determine possible changes that may affect the Define phase of the Six 
Sigma methodology as a result of digitalization. For the realization of the research objective, expert interviews as a 
method of qualitative investigation have been selected. Therefore, interviews with seven experts in the field of Six 
Sigma with different training and experience levels were conducted. Results indicate, that according to the experts’ 
assessment, the Define phase is only affected by minor changes caused by digitalization. They emphasize that the 
Define phase is characterized by human-supported working methods. Digitalization offers the chance of a more precise 
problem and target descriptions due to better data availability.  
 
Keywords  
Six Sigma, Digitalization, Process Optimization 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
The importance of digitalization in the business environment is growing steadily. Due to the increasing progress of 
digitalization, nearly every industry sector is affected by its effects (Lipsmeier et al., 2020). Digitalization will have a 
large influence on future business strategies. One of the affected areas is the implementation of optimization projects. 
Digital networking of workplaces and automated collection and evaluation of data also create new possibilities for 
optimization projects (Da Silva et al., 2020). A proven optimization approach is Six Sigma, which consists of a total 
of five phases and is used as a globally recognized method for improving processes and reducing errors (Melzer, 
2019).  
 
GoThe results show that 72 % of the participating German companies are concerned with the topic of digitalization. 
The survey reveals Big Data and Data Mining as the most influential digitalization trends on optimization projects in 
companies. Due to this digitalization trends, the participants consider a change in the Six Sigma methodology 
concerning digitalization. First results of the survey confirm the assumption that in the course of digitalization the 
optimization method Six Sigma will change its components and implementation. Every process improvement project 
that applies Six Sigma is following the five phases of the DMAIC methodology. These phases are Define, Measure, 
Analyze, Improve and Control. It is a fixed framework of how to run the project and every phase provides the needed 
tools to achieve the project goal (Melzer, 2019). The steps of the DMAIC cycle ensure that within the Define and 
Measure phases, there is transparency about the process and the needed data, the root cause of the problem is identified 
in the Analyze phase, the right actions are taken in the Improve phase and Control phase results in sustainable 
improvement of the process (George et al., 2016). As shown, Six Sigma is a comprehensive methodology, which is 
why this investigation is limited to the first phase of the DMAIC cycle, the Define phase. The influence of 
digitalization on the Define phase of the Six Sigma methodology has not yet been investigated in detail. Regarding 
the quantitative survey from 2018, the participants consider the influence of digitalization in the Define phase to be 
rather low. This investigation aims at focusing the research gap more in detail by analyzing the impacts of 
digitalization and answering the following research question:

232","analysis could be neglected. Because the SIPOC analysis serves as a communication medium for the entire project 
team to illuminate process steps that require explanation and to create a common understanding. Should digitalization 
influence the SIPOC analysis in future, it is important to ensure the actual value and purpose of the methodology are 
preserved.  
 
Regarding VOC, there are different assessments of the experts. For two of the experts, it is conceivable that new 
technologies will make relevant information on customer requirements available in databases. For example, potential 
conclusions about costumer requirements could be drawn from stored usage behavior. However, two of the experts 
believe that VOC will continue to be human-made, as direct personal communication is necessary to determine actual 
customer requirements.  
 
The same insight and argumentation also apply to the CTQ tree as the method also deals with customer requirements. 
According to expert opinions, digitalization can potentially be useful if the creation of the CTQ tree can be made 
easier and more valid based on better data. On average, the potential of digitalization in VOC is rated as rather low.  
Furthermore, the experts were asked to what extent an automation of the Define phase is feasible. All experts consider 
an automation of the Define phase to be impossible. It can be assumed that the Define phase will retain its form and 
necessity in future. There may only be potential to automate some of these areas. For example, an automated warning 
system could be implemented that determine defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and point out problems. This 
would allow reliable predictions of process quality and data-based assessments of the urgency of improvement projects 
based on early indicators. But the addition of digitalization has technical and supporting character and does not replace 
the methods. The still human-driven methods such as the project charter or stakeholder management will in future 
rely on automatically-collected data in the reactive approach of Six Sigma but as a supporting aid. Only the 
combination of humans and machines can Six Sigma develop its full potential. Six Sigma is a problem-solving 
technique that, despite automated support, ultimately still primarily requires human communication. Full automation 
would mean that interactive and interdisciplinary collaboration in improvement projects would be increasingly lost. 
This is neither desirable nor purposeful, which is why the Define phase is neither redundant nor dispensable in its 
form. Decisions in the Define phase often have to be made on the basis of complex circumstances that cannot be 
substituted by any automated procedure in future. These decisions are based on the joint development of results in a 
team as well as the human ability to think.  
 
5. Conclusion and Limitations 
 
The objective of this paper is to underestimate possible changes in the Define phase caused by the ongoing 
digitalization. In particular, the research objective is to examine the potential of the tools and existence of the Define 
phase within future. For this purpose, qualitative interviews with seven experts in the field of Six Sigma were 
conducted. The results are based on experience and subjective assessments of the selected experts.  
 
According to the experts’ assessment, a change in the Six Sigma methodology will occur as a result of progressive 
digitalization. The most significant change is expected in the area of data availability. The entire value chain is being 
networked. This makes data from individual process steps available, which allows a better description of the problem 
situation.  
 
The experts agree that the original form of the Define phase will change little in the course of digitalization. The 
influence of digitalization and automation is rated as low. This is due to the fact that the Define phase is strongly 
influenced by human labor. Tools contained in the Define phase are human-driven, which is why high data availability 
plays a subordinate role. Much more, the Define phase is based on an interactive exchange of specialists, a coherent 
way of thinking and the ability to make rational decisions. Nevertheless, the Define phase can be improved by 
digitalization in terms of a better data basis and thus a more precise description of the current situation and design of 
the project charter. The results of the expert interviews show that the Define phase can be supported by higher data 
availability in future, but the Define phase will remain a well-tried planning phase within the Six Sigma methodology.  
Regarding the generalizability of the findings, it needs to be stressed out that only a limited sample in terms of 
respective experts was interviewed. Qualitative research was employed to explore possible changes in the Define 
phase. By pre-structuring the interviews with topics derived from previous research, certain aspects may not have been 
examined in depth (e.g., further tools of the Define phase). Hence, generalizability and completeness of the results are 
limited.

240","In further research, the phases Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control are to be examined regarding the influence of 
digitalization on Six Sigma. According to the experts, the greatest benefits of digitalization are in the phases Measure, 
Analyze and Control. Furthermore, first practical attempts to digitize tools of the DMAIC cycle can be made in 
practice.

Abstract 
 
The use of fossil fuels to generate energy produces greenhouse gases, which is the main factor in climate change. 
Solar energy is a clean source of energy that is environmentally friendly. The photovoltaic (PV) system is a well-
established technology for converting solar energy into electrical energy. Sizing-decision of the PV system is a 
strategic decision-making process that has a long-term impact on the project. This work proposes an optimization 
model for the sizing decisions of the grid-connected PV system. The model considers the financial aspects in terms of 
minimizing project lifetime costs and the non-financial aspects in terms of reducing CO2 emissions and satisfying the 
planned service level. The decisions are the number of PV modules, the amount of energy purchased from the main 
grid, and the amount of energy supplied to the main grid. Besides an auxiliary binary variable for an either-or decision, 
either purchase-from or supply-to the grid. A case study is provided to clarify the model's practicality based on the 
residential area at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM). It is found that 1,670 PV modules are 
required to meet the annual demand at an annual cost of M$1.45 over 25 years.

1. Introduction 
Energy is essential for the economic, social, and industrial growth of any country. Energy demand is expected to be 
several times higher than currently in the coming years (Jamil et al., 2017). Greenhouse gasses such as CO2 and N2O 
are by-products of fossil fuels for electricity production. It is known that climate change is triggered by a rise in 
greenhouse gasses in the Earth's atmosphere (Mohammadi et al., 2018; Panwar et al., 2011). These gasses in the 
atmosphere have recently contributed to an uptick in world temperatures, ocean acidity, and unusual weather trends. 
As fossil fuels such as natural gas and crude oil will be exhausted within the next few years, plans have been made to 
explore green energies as an alternative to fossil fuels. 
 
Sources of renewable energy can be used repeatedly to produce energy,e.g., solar energy, wind energy, biomass 
energy, geothermal energy, etc. Solar thermal energy is the most abundant source of renewable energy and is available 
both directly and indirectly. PV is a well-established solar energy system that has become an appealing form of energy 
supply (Mohammadi et al., 2018). Various experiments have been undertaken to determine PV systems' technological 
efficiency and economic viability under various circumstances, e.g., temperature and solar radiation (Alam Hossain 
Mondal and Sadrul Islam, 2011; Allouhi et al., 2016; EL-Shimy, 2009; Khalid and Junaidi, 2013; Türkay and Telli, 
2011). 
 
Getting the PV system up and running requires several decisions, some of which have a long-term horizon, while 
others are more short-term. Dependent on the horizon's duration, decisions can be divided into three groups: strategic, 
tactical, and operational decisions. Only the optimal size decisions were considered in this work. The PV system's 
optimum size is a strategic decision, a long-term decision that is potentially costly and directly affects the system's 
reliability. 
 
PV systems may be built in rural areas to provide electricity or linked to power grids to sell power generated. The 
system utilizes a hybrid PV-battery network to supply sustained and reliable electricity due to solar energy's erratic 
existence. Energy storage eliminates the chance of intermittent power supply from PV and often means users can

of demand and the uncertainty in the PV system's energy generation.

Abstract 
 
Vehicular Networks are likely to be implemented in future vehicles. Their usage can enhance road safety and enable 
new forms of communications such as Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications. 
The simulation of this type of network is the most useful method to test new techniques, algorithms, and architectures. 
This is basically due to the high cost of deploying such systems in real scenarios. Named Data Networking (NDN) is 
a new architecture that researchers have proposed recently as a promising architecture for future Internet technologies. 
It is expected to support various applications in vehicular communications and aims to overcome the problem of 
classically TCP/IP-based architecture concerning mobility, by relying on naming the content rather than using end-
to-end node addresses. Indeed, the in-network caching feature in NDN makes this architecture more suitable for 
vehicular networks. To prove the usefulness of NDN in connected vehicles, we propose a simulation study in an urban 
network architecture.

1. Introduction 
In 2013, 5.6 million vehicle crashes and 32,719 deaths have been accounted, according to the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA). Motorists and onboard telematics solutions providers are concerned about 
automotive safety devices. With great support from the drivers, technological devices and systems related to 
automotive safety are being evolved: fatigue warning system, night vision assist system, reversing sensor, lane 
departure warning, … etc. 
 
Manufacturers discussed different conceptions and notions such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in 
order to achieve road safety and comfortable driving. Today, a variety of technologies are already deployed and 
vehicles can now use navigation systems, connect to the network and run different applications. In addition to the 
mentioned services, manufacturers and research communities aim to achieve Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) (Sabir & 
Amine, 2021a) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communications (V2I) (Sabir et al., 2019) (Sabir & Amine, 2021c) in 
order to enhance road safety by exchanging alerts and safety messages between vehicles and between vehicles and 
Road Side Units (RSUs). 
 
Most connected vehicle applications are IP-based network protocol, which influences both quality of service 
(QoS) and latency. Nevertheless, the IP protocol is designed for host-to-host connection which is low effective for 
information dissemination. Moreover, IP protocol is unsatisfactory in supporting direct communication in connected 
vehicles with high mobility and in absence of Road Side Units (RSU). Thus, many researchers begin to test Named 
Data Networking (NDN), a new Internet architecture, in connected vehicle applications (Sabir & Amine, 2018). This 
architecture supports the caching of data in the network in order to satisfy future requests, which gives an advantage 
to NDN in terms of data transfer.  
 
In this paper, we present a simulation study of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), the 
current Internet model, and NDN, the future Internet architecture, over vehicular networks. We attempt to study the 
performance of the new architecture compared to the old one. This paper is considered a continuation of our previous 
work (Sabir & Amine, 2020). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the limitations

5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we presented a performance analysis through a simulation with both NDN and TCP/IP-based vehicular 
networks. Using the ndnSIM and ns-3 simulators, we have conducted a comparison of connected vehicle systems 
powered by NDN and TCP/IP solutions. The simulation results show that the NDN-based vehicular communication 
system lowers the packet delay and raises the throughput compared with the TCP/IP-based one.  It is also worth saying 
from the sent and received packets graphs that the data drop rate is null in NDN compared to the TCP/IP. We can 
conclude by stating that NDN-based networking is a promising alternative to the conventional IP-based one for 
vehicular communications, and it can be implemented in the near future to make the transportation system intelligent 
and accident-free. In our future work, we will propose a new method to enhance security in vehicular networks over 
NDN.

Abstract 
 
Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are the principal actors of the innovation process in the national 
business system of countries. Despite this, these enterprises face many economic, organizational and market barriers 
which may hinder the implementation of innovations. This issue is particularly relevant in Italy, where MSMEs 
represent 99% of the enterprises. The present study aimed to investigate the willingness to invest in innovations and 
related perceived barriers in a group of micro and small enterprises operating in the agricultural machinery 
manufacturing industry in northern Italy. Forty-two enterprises answered a questionnaire investigating: i) firm’s 
characteristics, ii) interest in introducing innovation and willingness to invest in it, iii) perceived barriers and iv) 
respondent’s socio-demographic information. Overall, economic issues, the lack of qualified personnel and difficulty 
in finding cooperation partners were cited as the foremost barriers. In detail, the firms with a higher level of 
management organization and more willing to invest in innovations were also those perceiving barriers the most. Our 
results showed that enterprises are actually trying to innovate but targeted measures and interventions should be 
adopted to support the firms in the innovation process. Implications and future research developments to promote 
innovation in micro and small enterprises are discussed.

1. Introduction 
Innovation plays a key role in the competitiveness of companies (Madrid-Guijarro et al. 2009) and can be defined as 
a process that leads to the commercialization of an invention born from a new idea; then, when the innovation reaches 
the market it becomes part of normal practice and procedure (Schumpeter,1939). In recent years, innovation processes 
have increasingly addressed socio-environmental issues, thus leading entrepreneurial activities toward sustainable 
development (Dias Angelo et al. 2015), in accordance with the significant presence of regulations promoting the 
adoption of environmental innovations and the institutional pressures toward such innovations (Pinget et al. 2015). 
Innovation consists of several activities (Antonioli et al. 2010) which can be classified into three main macro-
categories: technical innovation, marketing innovation and organizational innovation. Moreover, the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) discerns technical innovation in two other categories, product 
innovation and process innovation (Avolio et al. 2014; OECD, n.a). Product innovation involves the development of 
a good or service that is new or significantly improved in technical specifications, components and materials, 
embedded systems, user-friendliness or other functional characteristics; likewise, through process innovation the

Abstract 
 
This paper presents the approach and results of an improvement project carried on by a company that provides business 
process outsourcing services based on customised software solutions. The critical objectives considered were to 
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes involved in developing customised solutions. Thus, the focus 
of this research was to identify problems in current processes and practices and develop possible solutions to improve. 
The processes were mapped, the inefficiencies were identified, and suggestions for improvements were presented and 
analysed. It was concluded that the main problems with the project management and software development processes 
are related to the lack of visibility of the team load, lack of standardisation and inefficient management processes. 
These causes result in problems such as IT being unable to plan work and problems associated with quality that 
negatively influence the lead time of projects. Therefore, suggestions for improvement were formulated and prioritised 
to address each of these aspects. A more agile approach to software development and redesigning the processes for 
creating customised solutions were the solutions developed. There was also a need to develop the existing project 
management software changes to adapt it to these changes.

1. Introduction 
 
In response to market needs, to stand out and create a competitive advantage, many companies defined and developed 
initiatives scoping the digitalisation of their business processes. Indeed, as technology change accelerates and new 
digital solutions emerge, many companies feel the pressure to perform a digital transformation not to lose their 
competitive advantage. For Downs and Nunes (2013), digital transformation integrates digital technology into all areas 
of a business, fundamentally changing how companies operate and deliver value to customers. This is one of the 
biggest challenges that companies are facing today. No industry or organisation can stay indifferent to digital 
transformation. Therefore, entire business models are being rethought and reformulated. 
 
For Urbach, Ahlemann and Böhmann, (2017), new service architectures and business models began to be widely 
adopted, such as Software as a Service (SaaS). This represents a shift from traditional software package license 
purchases to remotely ""renting"" specific software services where a business model is paid for usage. For Horlach, B., 
Drews, P., and Schirmer, I. (2016), these changes should allow the business to be better informed, more flexible, and 
faster in adapting services and products to market opportunities and customer needs. Realising these needs for new 
business models and strategies is essential not only for companies facing these changes but simultaneously to 
understand the challenges of companies that support this digital transformation. Through SaaS models and customised 
software solutions, these types of companies are responsible for the development and are responsible for the security, 
performance, availability, and stability of the service.

286","and an appointment for a kick-off project meeting. In this kick-off meeting, the final document must be presented and 
signed by all stakeholders, including, of course, the client. 
 
As we already mentioned during the development, the IT manager is responsible for the sprints planning. Every seven 
days, developments must be demonstrated and approved by the IT Manager, and suggestions for customer 
improvements must be evaluated. After each meeting, a minute of the meeting should be attached to the documents 
of the project. Simultaneously, an independent team must carry out an internal audit to check the main deliverables at 
the end of each sprint. As a result of this audit process, a non-conformity report must be prepared and delivered to the 
Product Owner to create corrective measures. These measures must be transformed into tasks and included in the 
product backlog so that non-conformities are corrected.  
 
As the agile development process is iterative and incremental with the different stakeholders, the same sales team 
responsibility no longer exists. Then, in the last meeting where the developments are demonstrated, the test phase and 
pilot period dates must be defined considering the period in the budget. 
 
The test phase already takes place in the production environment. What we proposed was the creation of a test 
environment before going to production. The code is a review, and the uniformity of the nomenclature and the 
documentation of the code is verified so that there is the slightest difference in the code of the different programmers. 
This is a change with the past delivery method because the code is now reviewed by the IT manager regarding 
efficiency and not just about effectiveness. The process finishes after the pilot, with the moment pre-defined to go live 
with a kick-off meeting. 
 
6. Main Conclusions and future research 
A qualitative approach to research, informal workshops, and data analysis allowed the identification of relevant 
metrics in analysing the company's software development and project management processes, thus managing to 
answer our first research question. When we identified problems that affect processes, opportunities for improvement, 
and the root causes of problems, we faced a significant challenge from the beginning. The procedures are mainly ad 
hoc. However, direct observation of the team's tasks, document analysis and informal workshops allowed the 
identification of 28 causes or opportunities affecting the failure to achieve the expected results in each phase of the 
process. After the causes have been identified, we can see that the main problems with the project management and 
software development processes are the lack of visibility of the team load, lack of standardisation, and deficient 
management processes. These causes result in problems such as IT being unable to plan the work in advance and 
problems associated with quality that negatively influence the lead time of projects. 
 
So, we believe that with a more agile approach to SD, specifically using some of the techniques and events of Scrum, 
we managed to improve the current state of the situation concerning team management. Regarding inefficient 
processes and lack of standardisation, we opted for redesigning the entire process of creating customised solutions by 
the company. As successful process redesign projects often involve significant efforts in information systems, we have 
also implemented several changes to the current project management software to adapt it to new changes. All changes 
were accepted and prepared to be implemented, however not all were initiated given the time of the project.  
 
Given the short project time and the company's priority to improve the development of customised solutions and the 
management of projects associated with this solution, it would be interesting to see if this development model would 
apply to its other solutions. Thus, it would be interesting to analyse the impact of improvements in the budgeting 
process on the percentage of conversion from a prospect to a client (hit rate). 
 
As a proposal for future studies in this area, we recommend focusing on the impact of a change in the organisational 
structure. This company has a very vertical model of organisational structure, which, as the literature points out, can 
hinder an improvement process. Thus, future research can focus on assessing the impact of changing the current model 
to a more horizontal structure model. 
 
Finally, in addition to the limitations mentioned throughout this chapter, we also point out that the context of our 
project is the specific context. Thus, future investigations may choose to evaluate the applicability of our solutions in 
different contexts because the literature is inconclusive and controversial.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented changes in the trucking industry. 70% of all freight tonnage 
goes on trucks, including essential items such as food, medical supplies, and cleaning products. COVID-19 caused 
surges in demand for many of these products, impacting the trucking companies. Medical supplies, cleaning supplies, 
food, and even the COVID-19 vaccine itself rely on the trucking industry to be distributed across the nation, creating 
a new, increased demand for goods. The increase in demand caused a surge of trucks on the road, which is a good sign 
for the business, but at a cost to the drivers during these times. Closures due to the pandemic created problems for 
long-haul truckers who are on the road and need a place to rest, get gas, or buy food. Besides, truckers are now 
expected to work longer hours and make longer trips to meet the new demand. The limitations that the pandemic has 
created on the trucking industry have also affected the overall revenue. Trucking companies are reluctant to send 
trucks to highly impacted areas, even if those areas contribute most to the increased demand. This paper will explore 
the different ways that COVID-19 affected the trucking industry, how they responded, and how their response 
continues to affect the industry.

1. Introduction 
The trucking industry is essential for the global and domestic supply chain. Without trucks, the last mile delivery 
would become much more complicated and inefficient, and the majority of supply chains rely on trucks for some part 
of their deliveries. Due to this, the trucking industry has a massive effect on subsequent industries across the globe. 
Trucks deliver essential products such as food, medical supplies, gas, and water.  
 
COVID-19 has had a dramatic effect on multiple industries, and the goal of this paper is to analyze the effect of 
COVID-19 on the trucking industry and the effect that it has had on the global supply chain. Some industries have 
been forced to cease production, whereas others have had a spike in demand. This affects the trucking industry in that 
the historical demand and planning were disrupted, and thus routes and quantities were unexpectedly changed. In 
addition to this, the frontline of the trucking industry, the truck drivers, were affected by this as well. Many of the 
amenities that are essential for them to complete their deliveries, such as rest stops, gas stations, and hotels, were 
closed, which made this already demanding job even more difficult.   
 
This paper aims to examine the different areas in the trucking industry that experienced negative or positive changes 
due to the global pandemic and the importance of creating guidelines to keep truck drivers safe and vital supplies 
delivered globally. The goal is to highlight the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trucking industry due to 
the immense importance that the trucking industry has in many supply chains, especially the essential supply chains 
of food and medical services.

7. Conclusion 
 
As shown in this paper, the trucking industry was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The trucking industry 
is a highly used and supported mode of transportation for goods cross-country. It has been growing in technology and 
changing due to different demands in the market. The pandemic increased E-commerce, which was one of the reasons 
the trucking industry needed to adapt and be flexible in uncertainty. There were both drastic increases and decreases 
in demand for certain goods that rely on trucking. Increases in demand of restocking stores even gave trucking 
""emergency relief"" benefits and regulations. Truckers were also directly affected by the pandemic through many safety 
protocols set by rest areas, gas stations, and restaurants. Due to many of these changes, truckers' stress has increased 
drastically, while their overall emotional health has decreased. Truck drivers are one of the most at-risk groups due to 
their long-haul distance travels and being in high contact, high variety zones.

Abstract 
 
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a profound effect on all supply chains and markets worldwide. 
However, most of the analysis has taken place from the brick and mortar or buyer's perspective. The purpose 
of this paper is to capture the effects of these closures and business limitations further upstream at the 
supplier level. Specifically, the metal casting business that supplies all sorts of industries, from medical 
implants to construction. Due to the cancellation of non-essential surgeries at hospitals, demand for medical 
implants has stagnated while the demand for construction has continued. By surveying stakeholders in 
California's metal casting industry, this research explores how this complex and diverse vocation fulfills 
these demands and how they have adapted to these changes.

1. Introduction  
In the aftermath of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, many businesses and industries experienced drastic and 
uncontrollable changes. In perhaps one of the most overlooked industries, net shape and metal casting manufacturing 
businesses were not exempted from the list of casualties. In initial research for the effects of COVID-19 on industries, 
the commonality is that the analysis has occurred on the brick-and-mortar level. In other words, from the buyer's 
perspective. This paper aims to research and analyze the affect effect that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the 
casting industry from further upstream in the supply chain… the supplier level. Since this industry fulfills such a wide 
variety of needs in the marketplace, from large-scale construction to medical implants, and even household appliances, 
the effects carried from the initial shock and followed through with the unique restrictions have formulated a unique 
set of challenges for the industry to overcome. Hospitals canceled non-essential surgeries, and the demand for medical 
devices stagnated while the demand in the construction industry surged. By providing research through exclusive 
interviews with industry professionals, we will be able to analyze where the supply chain fell short and how net shape 
manufacturers were able to overcome this unique set of challenges. 
 
2. Objectives 
This research paper will explore how the metal casting industry has been affected by this global pandemic and key 
response decisions and whether they appropriately interacted to overcome the pandemic's hindrance to business. Using 
other key studies and business resources for reference and interviewing plant managers in the field, we considered 
specific elements like work reduction due to decreasing demand, worker safety changes, and indicators like lead time 
and inventory to understand the effect on businesses. 
 
3. Literature Review 
Wetzel (2020) investigated the impact of COVID-19 on foundries in the Midwest to see how their production shifted 
due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They found that some foundries pivoted from their typical products to manufacture 
components for ventilators, MRI machines, etc. This pivot allowed the foundries to remain working, and in one case,

308","Company A also commented that they believe Boeing will not return to normal production levels for the next five 
years. Internationally, air travel is not expected to return to pre-pandemic trip length levels before 2025 (Brothers, 
2021). 
 
7. Conclusion  
We found that the companies interviewed reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic differently, though with the common 
denominators of ensuring worker safety as a priority, exploring new markets, and making changes within the company. 
Both Company A and Company B kept the cases among their workforce to a minimum, with the cases that did occur 
believed to have originated from outside of the workplace. The COVID-19 pandemic also served as an opportunity 
for the companies to explore new markets and make changes within their company that may not have previously been 
reasonable. Some of these changes, such as virtual meetings, may stay after the pandemic is over, pushing both 
companies further into the digital age. Regarding the suppliers of the two companies interviewed, COVID-19 had a 
direct effect on their production capabilities either due to the incapacitation of their workforce or forcing the closing 
of the company. Downstream in the supply chain, customers of these two companies experience reduced demand, 
which forced them to cancel existing contracts and decreased the number of future contracts created. Due to pressure 
from above and below in the supply chain, Company A and Company B were forced to respond reactively rather than 
proactively due to their size compared to their suppliers and customers.

Abstract 
 
Despite the start of a new year, COVID-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, continues 
to impact people's lives on a global scale. The outbreak of the disease was first reported on December 31, 2019. At 
this time, governments all over the world are scrambling to vaccinate their citizens. As of January 2021, six vaccines 
have been approved by a handful of countries. Approving a new vaccine and then mass-distributing it to an entire 
nation is a pressing yet complicated process. This paper will focus on defining successful vaccine deployment and 
discussing how certain countries are currently handling the task. The global COVID-19 vaccine supply chain will be 
discussed for each of the six vaccines and touch on various topics such as the development process, manufacturing 
locations, storage requirements, proximity to approved countries, capacity, and how demand is being fulfilled. This 
information will be used to evaluate how well different governments are obtaining and distributing the vaccines and 
offer suggestions to improve this process moving forward.

Abstract 
  
The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the market such that both supply and demand are less predictable than ever 
before. U.S. businesses have had to learn to adapt to the rapid influx of demand in unexpected areas while demand 
slows in others, especially in the food industry. One way to address this is to utilize sharing economy within the supply 
chain, more specifically in last-mile logistics. Adopting a sharing economy model allows for an intimate working 
relationship between the company and a worker that can resemble an employee without much of the continuous 
employment and associated overhead costs. A form of this is independent contractors, who can be brought in rapidly 
when both supply and demand are high and can cope with the low demand with a reduced consequence to the business. 
One such example is a third-party app-based service providing the last mile logistics for restaurants. This research 
investigates the overarching impacts on the restaurant industry of a shift from consumers traveling to sharing economy 
providing last-mile logistics.

Supply Chain, Sharing Economy, Independent Contractors, COVID-19 
  
1. Introduction 
 
The sharing economy has been rising consistently over the past decade. As of September 30, 2020, there are over 4.9 
billion internet users worldwide, which has led to a new era of connectivity between people (Internet World Stats, 
2021). In addition to this, there are now 3.8 Billion smartphones globally (O'Dea 2021). These facts, paired with the 
global initiative to reduce the waste of material resources, have led to a dynamic shift from a traditional consumer-
based economy to a sharing economic ideology. According to PWC's 2015 study, by 2025 sharing economy in all its 
sectors is expected to be up to 50% of their relative industries (Ostovitz 2015). 
 
Coming into 2021, COVID-19 is a factor that was not anticipated in the growth of the sharing economy; however, it 
has exacerbated many of the foundations of what led sharing economy to grow initially. During COVID-19, and 
particularly the lockdowns that occurred globally, companies began to face a new problem— the inability to reach 
their users. Particularly in the food industry, as people become fearful of entering the public space, restaurants suffered 
directly from this lack of sales. For example, the restaurant ""886"" in New York City saw an over 80% reduction in 
sales (Ho 2020). These reductions in sales, and a lack of desire for consumers to have in-person interactions, opened 
the window for the people who had the assets to transport goods (i.e., a car or bicycle) to enter this space to transport 
food and goods from businesses to peers. This service has allowed consumers and businesses to interact while limiting 
the total number of people entering restaurants and public spaces. Although this can be vital to the restaurant and 
grocery stores surviving this pandemic, it comes at a cost. The organizers of sharing economy need to profit as well 
and will often take cuts of over 30% from restaurants (Rana et al. 2021), which is well over some restaurants' profit 
margins. 
 
This paper hopes to understand how the increase in the sharing economy due to COVID-19 has affected the food 
delivery industry and how these impacts may last beyond the pandemic.

317","That said, delivery apps have found a way to make up for the lost revenue with new city-based fees that are charged 
directly to the consumer. For example, in Portland, Oregon, Uber Eats implemented a $3 ""Portland Fee"" after the 
city implemented a 10% service fee cap. Though this does increase the total cost of the order, the burden is placed 
entirely on the consumer, which aligns with our third overarching recommendation and thus keeps the price-gouging 
activity away from the restaurants that are suffering most (Bailey Jr. 2020). This appears to be a more sustainable 
solution than forcing heavy service fees on restaurants alone, and we may see this shift in payment structure stay 
relevant for the near future. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Looking at each of the three main parties involved (restaurants, delivery services, and customers), we can see how 
COVID-19 has affected the relationship between them. Mainly, the power has shifted towards food delivery services 
instead of the restaurants, allowing these services to set high fees on restaurants without much opposition. If customers 
continue to order food virtually, this will continue to happen. This harms these restaurants and their employees, as 
shown through the somewhat negative responses towards food delivery services seen from our case study interviews. 
However, as the number of COVID-19 cases declines, we can then expect more orders to be placed in-person. 
Along with this, with cities across the United States implementing service fee caps on delivery services, we predict 
restaurants will run on higher margins as the pandemic ends. This shift will likely cause profits for food delivery 
services to dip. However, as seen before the pandemic, these services will likely still maintain a solid footing in the 
U.S. economy.

 Abstract 
 
Augmented reality (AR) has a strong potential for success in improving supply chain operations and can 
impact how the manufacturing and distribution sectors are handled. The application of AR devices can 
reduce cost, time, and error rates as well as increase usability of a system and productivity. There is a need 
for augmented reality within inventory management to help order picking, assess product damage, and 
display inventory instructions. AR technology can be applied to improve the following networks within 
supply chains: it can instruct workers on where to find inventory within a warehouse and help to reduce 
time, workers could identify objects quicker without having to scan or type codes, and products can be 
sorted faster with lower error rates. Further, manufacturing tool maintenance can be more easily monitored 
and addressed remotely. Standard picking and packing procedures can be displayed for workers increasing 
worker safety and efficiency, and fewer workers would be needed to achieve inventory goals. These 
improvements can result in a decrease in the cost of labor and production time, increased accuracy, and 
expanded production capacity for companies. The purpose of this paper is to review current case studies 
regarding the use of AR technology in supply chain operations, specifically in inventory management, and 
showcase the potential cost reductions by applying AR to these operations.

1. Introduction 
Warehouse operations are key factors in supply chains because they focus on the movement and storage of materials 
and any processes associated with them (Warehouse Management: Supply Chain 24/7 2020). These processes include 
recording transactions in shipping, receiving, put-away and picking. The customers expect to purchase and receive 
their products the following day (Romaine 2020). Therefore, within the supply chain, there is always a need to improve 
warehouse operations' speed and efficiency. When industries cannot meet this expectation, they will lose customers 
and ultimately profit; thus, there has been a considerable focus on improving warehouse operations. 
 
With the pandemic and lockdown starting in the United States in March 2020, there has been a demand to integrate 
automation into US-based warehouses. Companies realized they could not rely on people to perform all their functions 
in their warehouses. This led to the need for the integration of automation to help reduce labor demand. There needs 
to be a way to have operators work faster without an increase in error rate or labor force. With augmented reality, 
operators can have direct, real-time access to a company's inventory database so they can improve their put-away and 
picking processes. Through this report, we hope to educate the audience on the opportunities AR can bring into 
warehouses.

4. Results and Discussion 
AR is adaptable. It can be applied to various needs within a company. By using AR technology to their advantage, 
companies can become more efficient and competitive. The long-term effects AR can bring into the workplace will 
benefit the company by increasing work productivity, reducing the error rate, and saving time. The four case studies 
explored in this paper demonstrate that augmented reality can be applied to several functions. Case 1 explored AR's 
application in the four main areas of warehouse operations: receiving, storing, picking, and shipping. By simplifying 
the user experience, workers can work faster with lower error rates. Case 2 describes how operators can navigate AR 
devices' assistance, which will present real-time data from the company's inventory database. This can result in a 
decrease of order picking time and time wasted inputting data into the system at a desktop. Case 3 discusses how the 
CARM2-PSS system can improve operations by reducing maintenance costs and time. The CARM2-PSS system is 
simple to use and applicable in various fields in the manufacturing industry aimed to monitor quality testing. Finally, 
Case 4 introduces how AR can be used for virtual training, which can reduce the time it takes to train workers and 
develop new instructional procedures. 
 
In addition to adaptability, AR can be inexpensive. Additional costs are dependent on the type of display used. As 
previously stated, displays are sorted into three categories: head-mounted displays (HMD), handheld displays, and 
spatial displays. Ordinary tablets and smartphones are categorized as handheld displays, have the capability to use AR 
software, and are least costly compared to specialized AR equipment. 
 
4.1 Future Steps 
Three future steps are identified in this paper: data visualization implementation for supply chain decisions, inventory 
management, and virtual training. First, Cloud-based AR systems for manufacturing sites could be used to automate 
and help provide logistical support regarding inventory movement and maintenance. Second, AR devices could assist 
in inventory management by instructing facility operators to use an HMD along with AR technology to improve the 
overall error rate that pickers made and time spent during the picking operation. Third, AR could be utilized in training 
employees with new equipment. By further integrating the software with a mobile application it can help streamline 
the training process and provide employee progress to management. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Augmented reality can be used in supply chain management to improve warehouse and manufacturing operations in 
various ways, as seen through the results of the case studies and in prior research. As seen through the case studies, 
AR technology is quite versatile and can increase productivity throughout supply chains. More specifically, AR 
technology has been used in the past to increase efficiency in receiving, storing, picking, and shipping processes. AR 
is also used to forecast demand accurately, designate warehouse layouts and order-picking processes, to diagnose 
maintenance problems in manufacturing equipment. And lastly, to increase the effectiveness of training employees. 
Through the case studies and literature review, it is apparent that the applications of augmented reality throughout 
supply chains have a big potential to change the way they are operated. These improvements can save companies time, 
reduce costs, reduce error rates, and promote a highly efficient production environment.

Abstract 
 
Despite the effort of governments in promoting stricter safety requirements to reduce the number of accidents among 
farmers, agriculture still represents a very hazardous sector worldwide. In particular, the increasing importance of 
safety in the agriculture activities has been characterizing this sector both from the equipment manufacturers’ and 
from users’ point of view, since the use of tractors is recognized as the main cause of fatalities. In fact, tractor overturn 
associated with the absence or the improper use of the rollover protective structure (ROPS) represents the prevalent 
cause of this phenomenon. In this study we focused our attention on the use of aftermarket weather cabins and their 
interferential relationship with the tractor’s protective structure. Actually, although the use of weather cabins 
temporarily installed on tractors for specific needs is very common among farmers, there is a lack of a normative 
framework that can provide safety requirements for both users and cabin manufacturers. In detail, taking the cue from 
the issues emerged in a specific working group led by the National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work 
in Italy, the manuscript analyzes the hazardous situations that might arise when using weather cabins, discussing the 
safety measures aimed at guaranteeing a correct safety assessment.

 1. Introduction 
 
Agriculture is considered a hazardous sector worldwide (Caffaro et al. 2017a; Fargnoli et al. 2019a, Ivascu and Cioca 
2019) and in such a context the use of tractors is deemed to be the source of the majority of fatal and severe accidents 
occurred (Caffaro et al. 2017b; Kogler et al. 2016). In particular, tractor overturn associated with the absence of the 
rollover protective structure (ROPS) and seatbelt has been recognized as the prevalent cause of this phenomenon 
(Schwab et al. 2018, Tinc et al. 2018; Mann and Jespen 2017). Nowadays, the presence of these safety components 
(i.e. ROPS and seatbelt) is mandatory in most countries both for new tractors and for the older ones, which should be 
retrofitted accordingly (Cecchini et al. 2018; Fargnoli and Lombardi 2020). Nevertheless, the number of unprotected 
tractors is still very large due to multiple reasons, ranging from the financial efforts needed for retrofitting (Jenkins et 
al. 2012; Myers and Purschwitz 2012), to the negative attitude of farmers about the need of updating older tractors in 
accordance with mandatory safety requirements (Sorensen 2006; Caffaro et al. 2018a). In addition, it has to be 
highlighted that a large number of aged tractors are used by non-professional farmers, i.e. people performing 
agricultural activities for hobby or part-time job (Fargnoli et al. 2018; Caffaro et al. 2018b), as well as by foreigner 
operators (Vigoroso et al. 2019). In these cases, the operator skills might vary greatly, as well as the related knowledge 
of safety practices and obligations. In order to support and motivate farmers owing aged tractors in dealing with safety

Moreover, the importance of a reverse engineering approach for machinery safety based on ergonomic issues is 
confirmed in literature by several studies (Fargnoli et al. 2012; Casazza et al. 2016; Fargnoli et al. 2020). Based on 
this, the analysis carried out to depict and verify the safety criteria for the proper use of aftermarket weather cabins 
and their interferential relationship with the tractor’s protective structure provided a scientific support to the 
implementation of a technical guideline issued by INAIL. In fact, this document is currently being validated by the 
Italian National Unification association and it will be published as a technical standard recognized at the national 
level. Such an output provides a solution to the lack of a technical reference for the safe use of weather cabs in 
agriculture, providing a guidance not only for the manufacturers of this type of products, but also for the 
users/entrepreneurs when performing risk assessment of their working equipment. In fact, as underlined by Caffaro et 
al. (2017b), occupational health and safety (OHS) has to be considered from both sides, finding new effective 
strategies and tools to reduce accidents and injuries associated with the use of hazardous machinery. This is also in 
line with Kogler et al. 2016, who highlighted the importance of providing information tools, such as guidelines, aimed 
at improving the safety level of farmers. Accordingly, the contribution of the research work described in the present 
paper consists in enhancing knowledge on the safe selection and use of work equipment. Hence, the criteria illustrated 
in the previous section can be used also for other types of machinery, such as the ones used in mining, construction, 
and other earthmoving activities (e.g., scrapers and graders, equipped with aftermarket cabs).

Abstract 
 
In the last years, the paradigm of the Portuguese footwear industry has improved drastically to become one of the 
main world players. In fact, a lot has changed, from low-cost mass production to serving clients consisting of small 
retail chains, where orders are small and models are varied. In order to deal with such modifications, the footwear 
industry started investing in technological solutions. The industrial case presented in this paper fits that purpose. The 
goal is to contribute to the solution of complex scheduling problems arising in the new mixed-model flexible automatic 
stitching systems of an important footwear factory. The project starts by building an optimization model. Although 
the model has its own usefulness, the CPLEX program is only capable of reaching optimal solutions for small problem 
instances. Therefore, a recent metaheuristic, the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), has been chosen to tackle 
larger problems. The ICA is capable of finding optimal results for smaller instances and achieving adequate solutions 
for real problems in short periods of time. Moreover, ICA improves the results obtained so far by the method currently 
used in the factory.

1. Introduction 
 
The Portuguese footwear industry has remarkably improved its quality and international competitiveness over the last 
years. Creative design, the achievement of a technological leadership in the type of materials and productive 
equipment, the progress in management solutions and skilled labor, among other aspects, have been crucial for this 
improved performance. Nowadays, production flexibility, both in volume and variety, and fast response times are key 
factors for a company to succeed. This is because demand is increasingly consisting of small orders with a great variety 
of models. As a consequence, many factories need to transform or adapt their production systems to answer to the new 
production paradigm and simultaneously handle mixed models. 
That is evident in the important footwear factory considered in this work, whose production is almost entirely for 
export. The company invested (and participated in their design) in completely new flexible automated assembly 
systems, which can transport boxes, with components of different models, from and to warehouses, and visiting, in 
any order, the convenient workstations with specialized operators. 
These flexible assembly systems, namely the stitching systems, open up many potentialities. However, they require 
complex scheduling problems to be solved involving large dozens of boxes and workstations. Automatic optimized 
solutions to these problems not only avoid a permanent and difficult human planning, but are also expected to increase 
productivity, decrease cycle times, smooth workloads and, naturally, promote the competitive advantages of the 
factory. Although the modelling of the scheduling problems and the solution approaches to be develop are completely

The stopping criteria for the ICA was the execution time, with this being adapted according to the dimension of the 
problem. 
 
The results obtained made it possible to draw some conclusions. Firstly, the solution obtained for the smaller instances 
was equal to the optimal solution, which validates the correct functioning of the ICA. In fact, the solution proves that 
the ICA attempts to solve the problem defined by the optimization model. Secondly, it can also be said that the ICA 
has a good performance, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. For the 3 smaller instances, the ICA was able 
to reach the optimal solution in little time. For the 4 larger instances, the average GAP is less than 5%, and the 
execution time is within the acceptable for the industrial case (where a maximum execution time of 300 seconds is 
convenient). 
 
It is also important to state that it was not possible to obtain a solution for the industrial case since the computer's 
RAM was not enough to keep all the variables generated by the model due to the size of the real problem. Furthermore, 
even with more RAM, the exponential growth of the execution time with the size of the problem makes it impracticable 
to use the model in the industrial case. This indicates that using the optimization model in CPLEX directly for the 
industrial case is not a viable option. 
 
6.2 Industrial case 
 
Since this real problem could not be solved with CPLEX, it was important to find a procedure to evaluate the quality 
of the solutions attained by the ICA. 
 
In this sense, a simulation program was developed which balanced and scheduled the operations according to the 
method currently used by the factory. This way, it is possible to obtain the makespan by simulating the factory method 
and compare the solution with the one obtained by the ICA. 
 
In the case of the ICA, to evaluate the makespan, it was run 5 times and the value of the best solution throughout the 
execution time was registered for each of the runs.  
 
The makespan value obtained by the simulation is 564.16 minutes. The average value makespan value obtained by 
the ICA is 546.26 minutes. This means that the ICA was capable of generating solutions that reduce the makespan 
obtained by the heuristic in 3.173%, approximately. Furthermore, the ICA converged quickly to a solution. In the run 
with the longest convergence time, the ICA took 92.067 seconds to get to the final value of the solution. This fast 
convergence is essential due to the need to obtain a solution in less than 5 minutes.

360","This paper addressed the design, development and testing of a new scheduling method for a complicated production 
problem in a large footwear factory. It should be mentioned that this type of industrial case is unique due to the newly 
installed automatic flexible transportation systems; moreover, scheduling problems in the footwear industry are not 
usually considered in the literature. 
 
The project started by building an optimization model for the problem, which was then programmed in CPLEX. The 
analysis of the results contributed to validating the model, which proved to adequately represent the essential matters 
of the proposed industrial case. Furthermore, the CPLEX model was also capable of reaching optimal solutions for 
small problem instances. 
 
A recent metaheuristic was chosen, the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA), to compensate for the expected 
limitations of the exact approach to tackle real larger problems. After the indispensable adaptation to the real 
scheduling case and the validation of its correct functioning, in particular by comparison with the optimal results for 
smaller instances, the computational tests indicated that the ICA obtains positive results in a short period of time. 
Furthermore, a solution representation and assimilation and mutation operators were specifically developed for the 
case study, and can be used on future research projects, by being incorporated in other metaheuristics applied to 
scheduling. 
 
In addition, and to achieve a more complete appraisal of the advantages of implementing the ICA, a simulator was 
created from scratch to obtain more results after applying the scheduling method currently in use at the factory. 
 
In conclusion, the new scheduling method for the industrial case, based on the ICA, succeeded in computational tests 
and practical evaluation. Consequently, it is now in the process of being integrated with the production management 
and control system. The approach is likely to be adapted for similar systems, in this or other industries.

Abstract  
As we enter the new year, two companies’ COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use in the United 
States. While they are only in the beginning stages of distribution, we have already seen many complications in the 
United States as each state has a unique policy on its distribution process. Within the state of California, the different 
counties are dealing with COVID-19 differently depending on the size of the population and geographical location. 
Depending on these factors, the counties throughout the state have their own ways of distributing the vaccine that is 
advised by the state. Even though each county has its own distribution method, California as a whole ranked 35th out 
of the 50 states for efficiency in vaccine distribution as of February 28, 2021. With the efficiency so low, and cases at 
an all-time high, states need to more effectively distribute the vaccine to those who need it most: at-risk individuals, 
frontline healthcare workers, and older adults. With the discovery of a new strain, counties within the state must 
properly contain the spread while administering vaccines in order for the country to rebound from extended 
lockdowns. Our paper addresses the distribution of the vaccine within California and provides insight on how the state 
can effectively and adequately do so.

Introduction 
 
On December 11, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first emergency use of the 
Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This was shortly followed by Moderna, which was issued approval on 
December 18, 2020 [10]. These relatively quickly mRNA vaccines are meant to slow the spread of the contagious 
SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, which caused the world to experience its first pandemic in over a decade. After initial 
approval of these vaccines, the FDA recommends who gets vaccinated first with the initial limited supply. After the 
recommendation, each state, tribe and territory is responsible for developing its own plan for who will be vaccinated 
first and following groups. “Experts say about 85% of Americans will need to be vaccinated to bring the COVID-19 
pandemic under control” [12]. In our project, we are analyzing the plan developed by California and its counties.  
The current problem is that the state of California is not distributing the vaccine to its residents at an efficient 
rate. As of February 28th, 2021 California’s resident vaccination rate in units of doses administered per doses 
distributed to the state is ranked 35/50 states at 73.6% efficiency. The objectives of the paper include breaking down 
the current distribution process, determining the inefficiencies, and creating improvements that can be made.  
 
2. 
Literature Review 
 
Many topics of research were necessary to learn about the past, present and future logistics of the COVID-
19 vaccine. Research was conducted for the following topics as of February 2021: types of vaccines and manufacturing 
processes, transportation of vaccines to the state of California, transportation of the vaccines to the counties within 
California, decisions on people able to get the vaccine, and if people are getting the vaccine when it is available to 
them.

364","where the shipments are received that vaccines are available. The audit could additionally extend to the distribution 
companies, ensuring they have the assets and resources to properly store and transport the vaccines. On the public 
sector side, California should survey their citizens to get a more precise idea of how many people will take the vaccine 
if it is available to them. An audit could be utilized in this scenario in order to check whether each county is doing 
their part to vaccinate the population and create a standard amongst local government and healthcare of devoting 
resources to end the pandemic.

Conclusion 
 
The coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and then by January 2020, China began 
their lockdown. Soon later, most of the world was on lockdown, including California in March of 2020. “On March 
30th, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) started a program they coined “Operation Warp 
Speed,” (OWS) in an attempt to expedite a COVID-19 vaccine” (Brothers). On December 11, 2020 the FDA issued 
the first Pfizer vaccine, and on December 18, 2020 the Moderna vaccine was approved.  
One factor that has caused inefficiencies in California’s distribution thus far is the disparity in population 
densities and demand of vaccines between urban and rural counties within the state. Since urban counties such as Los 
Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties have many citizens who want the vaccine, the demand is much higher in 
these counties. Taking this into account, these urban counties’ citizens are expressing their frustration with the state’s 
inability to fulfill this demand, whereas it is not an issue in rural counties. To alleviate this and ensure that distribution 
meets the demand, state regulators must incorporate policies to streamline distribution while accounting for the 
vaccine’s time sensitivity and cold storage.  
One step California is taking to improve vaccine distribution is the Blue Shield program, which will 
streamline distribution by taking pressure off the state. The third party Blue Shield will take a data-driven approach 
by giving vaccines to communities that have been severely affected by COVID contamination and death as a result of 
the virus. This will help resolve some of the problems that COVID has caused in these communities. Regarding the 
manufacturing of the vaccine, Pfizer Inc. CEO Albert Bourla announced on February 19, 2021 that the company will 
add additional capacity to its Kalamazoo site. In addition to the expansion of the site, Pfizer has contacted two new 
manufacturers to help with production. These efforts will hopefully bring the current manufactured rate of 5 million 
doses per week to around more than double [8]. Moderna plans to achieve a similar amount of vaccines manufactured 
per week to around 10 million doses by April 2021 [15]. Moderna plans to achieve the production goals by working 
closely with partners and the federal government to address production bottlenecks and accelerating production.  
With Blue Shield, hopefully distribution efficiency will improve so that 85% of the population can be 
vaccinated, which is the target number, in order for the pandemic to be considered under control.

Abstract  
 
The Crude Palm Oil (CPO) market of Indonesia is growing, with a production of around 45.8 million metric tons in 
2019. The forecasted domestic consumption will achieve 15 million metric tons in 2021. This number tends to 
increase due to the government policy that encourages the use of palm oil in biodiesel and renewable energy 
sources. Despite its positive benefit to the economy, CPO suffered from negative campaigns regarding sustainable 
development issues, particularly in CPO waste management of its derivative. One concern is regarding the 
availability of CPO waste treatment facility. The waste treatment facility should be located strategically considering 
various factors. This study proposed a mixed-integer linear programming model for the green facilities problem.  
The model is used to decide the facility location and allocation of CPO waste treatment by considering 
transportation cost, facilities development cost and emission cost as environmental factors.

1. Introduction  
Industries that survived the financial crisis, as well as the economic crisis caused by the Covid 19 pandemic 
in Indonesia, are agribusiness of staple food for surviving the important role in the supply of food (Nicola et al. 
2020). The agribusiness sector includes several economic activities that have direct and indirect linkages in terms of 
meeting intermediate industrial raw materials. Direct linkages include the relationship of agricultural commodities 
as input raw materials as well as marketing and trade activities that market agro-industrial end products. Indirect 
interrelationships in the form of economic activities that provide other input raw materials outside agricultural 
commodities, such as chemicals, packaging materials, etc., along with economic activities related to trade and 
supply chain (Saragih 2000; Bappenas RI 2017). In connection with that, agroindustry in palm oil industry activities, 
where Indonesia is the world's number one oil producer in 2020, it is important to make the palm oil industry 
comply with the principles of sustainability and innovation in a unified global value chain system (Pacheco et al. 
2017).  
Crude Palm Oil (CPO) receives several negative responses due to CO2 emissions generated during the 
production process. There is agreement about the emissions standards generated by industry, such as mentioned in

Abstract  
 
Baby walkers have a huge patronage since its introduction in the early 15th century in Europe among parents aiding 
their children in developing their baby’s locomotor skills, a common misconception that had been overlook, due to 
poor consideration of the early designs injury reduction had been outlooked resulting to injuries possible, toe walking 
due to mismatch on the early designs versus the infant’s body measurements. Despite the plea of medical professionals 
in banning the product in the market due to reported cases of emergency room injuries caused by walkers (Molina, 
2018) from which majority is from head and neck injuries along with reports that use of the baby device delays the 
developmental growth of the infant according to a cohort study and two cross sectional studies reporting 
developmental delays which has a long run to go since the evidence against the product is not enough considering the 
large number of baby walker users worldwide. Despite such plea market for walkers had been increasing according to 
the market analysis conducted by the authors potential market for the product is at 8,856 this 2018 and is projected to 
go up to 9,753 in 2022. A potential market size indicates a high social desirability for the device, thus the researcher 
sought to provide a correction to the design in order to minimize if not to eliminate possible risk of injuries. In order 
to develop a proposed design for the product, the researchers used anthropometry to determine the appropriate 
dimensions of the product. Identified which body dimensions will be needed as reference for the proposed product 
dimensions. After determining the appropriate body dimensions, the values for the dimension of the product parts with 
respect to the 5th and 95th. Materials to be used should be mainly made up of polyethylene and aluminum alloy.

1. Introduction 
Infant walkers have been a main stay in most households for childcare over the centuries. It is commonly 
made of a metal and plastic frame on wheels in which a baby is suspended in a sling-seat. Children usually use them 
between the ages of 4 and 12 months (Patricia Burrows, 2002). Most parents perceive that the use of baby walkers 
provides benefit for their growing child such as infant safety, encouraging mobility, promoting walking and providing 
exercise. Parents also believe that the incorporation of infant walkers in a child’s growth accelerates the development 
of independent walking skills (Miriam E Bar- on, 1998). But in contrast with public beliefs, number of researchers, 
medical practitioners and organizations tend to stop the use of baby walkers for it imposes threat to safety and 
developmental delays among infants. In a study done in the United States, infant walker – related injuries can be 
severe and can include skull fracture, brain injury, burns, poisoning and drowning. Also, 8 pediatric fatalities 
associated with infant walkers were recorded from 2004 to 2008. Despite these claims and recommendation from 
the American Academy of Pediatrics to ban the manufacture and sale of infant walkers, purchase and usage of these 
devices remain high among families (Ariel Sims, 2018). Reports and studies estimate that in the United States 
between 70% and 92% of parents with one – year old children use infant walkers (Patricia Burrows, 2002) (Ariel 
Sims, 2018). 
As strong opposition to the use of infant walkers arise over time, countries such as Canada completely 
banned the sale of these devices since 1989 and the American Academy of Pediatrics has not recommended the use 
of baby walkers as well. Contribution to child development and safety are two vital factors that can be considered in 
assessing current designs of walkers. Pediatricians emphasize that the use of infant walkers shows no substantial 
value in the development of a child’s motor skills. First, they provide precocious locomotion in infants, which may 
interfere with the natural process that an infant needs to develop. Second, they prevent visual experience of moving 
limbs because of their design which are believed to have a critical role in development of motor systems (Shervin

Design standard has an item mean of 4.21 (Above Expectation) meaning, the guardians see the design of the product 
is similar to what should be a baby walker look and function. While, Protective features (2.14) and Maintainability 
(1.45) has an item mean interpretation of Needs Attention, it shows absence or minimal function in terms of 
protective functions and maintainability of the designs are present.

5. Conclusion  
 
5.1 Recommendations 
 
Protection: Dimensions for the designs of the baby walker should be within the 95th and 5th 
percentile of the infant. The walkers’ leg should be adjustable with respect with the popliteal height, 
maximum height should be 19.5cm and minimum should be at least 13cm, leg braces should be spread 
out to provide higher stability to avoid tip overs. Lower base should be a plastic brace covered with foam 
since it is the portion most likely to collide to other objects. Addition of foam or air pump bracing could 
lessen the impact due to collision. Wheels should be caster wheels with locking mechanism so standing 
by, if the care taker would need to go somewhere for a short period of time. The seat should be made up 
of memory foam to flow airflow as well as to accommodate varying breath of the infant’s buttocks

In addition, a sensor and signal lights should be included to be located on the lower base of the walker 
mounted in the wheels. Mechanism should light when one of the wheels is not in contact with the floor (if 
hanging). Maintainability: To improve maintainability parts of the infant walker should be detachable and 
interchangeable. The study identified the primary concerns on the existing design of infant walker, 
according to the articles the existing design is prone for accidents as well as triggers tip toe walking that 
can lead to delay walking or possible injury or trauma in the leg area that might affect the development of 
locomotor skills of the infant. With this anthropometric measurement of the infant who uses infant walkers 
are harvest to provide design that can cater the dimensions of the baby as well as to address tip toe walking, 
additional functions such as sensors and locking are also recommend to be used as per the result of the 
product evaluation.

Abstract  
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the lives of people globally. The economy of countries as well 
as the mental health of human beings have deteriorated and it has also brought upon revolutionary changes. One of 
these significant changes has been organizations changing to remote working which developed as a result of social 
distancing of people. Remote working is when people perform their work from different locations, and, during the 
pandemic this has mainly been from home. The abrupt change to working from home was brought upon many South 
African employees during a period of uncertainty; there was no time for companies to prepare employees for this. As 
a result, the effect that remote working has had on employees in South Africa is unknown and therefore research was 
conducted to investigate issues pertaining to this. A survey was designed and electronically sent to participants; a 
sample size of 50 people was studied. Results were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS); 
the used of cross tabulations and chi square analysis was mainly used in the methodology. The challenges faced by 
employees were studied and solutions were suggested in order to overcome the challenges and maintain optimal levels 
of productivity. The main challenges faced by employees in South Africa included the effect of load shedding, longer 
working hours, the lack of resources, poor connectivity and a non-conducive home environment. Despite certain 
challenges, the majority of respondents stated that they would like to have a combination of a remote working and 
office based environment, and that remote working did not hinder productivity levels to a significant effect. Further 
research can be conducted with a different sample of employees, in different ages groups, as well as research done on 
employers.

1. Introduction  
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the lives of millions of people, globally. As a result of the 
pandemic, people lost their lives, loved ones and jobs, and the effects of these losses have had a detrimental impact to 
the mental health of many. Along with these losses, there have also been paradigm changes in many aspects of people’s 
lives. Due to the rapid spread of the virus, especially by people in close contact with one another, social distancing 
has to be adhered to at all times. This new “way of life” brought upon many changes in society and in the workplace. 
As a result of the new normal of social distancing, remote working became increasingly popular. Remote working or

assist employees in being more productive while maintaining their personal life. 
- 
The reduction of tedious and repetitive tasks could assist employees in handling their work load, especially 
when trying to establish a home-life balance.  This can be achieved by having automation-driven solutions 
which will take care of repetitive tasks and allow employees to focus more on creative and higher-level 
thinking work.  
- 
The mental health of employees should be taken into consideration at all times, especially during times of a 
pandemic and having to adjust to new work routines. It is the duty of employers to always communicate and 
establish the well-being of their employees and the way in which this could be improved. Surveys can be 
sent out regularly to identify the issues that employees may have and assistance should always be available 
for employees to cope. 
- 
Since the majority of respondents prefer a combination of remote working and office working, companies 
should implement having both. One of the ways of doing this is by having office space that can be booked in 
when an employee wants to come into work – a system will be created where an employee enters their details 
and books an office space (such as desk and equipment) to use on the days they want to come in. In this way, 
the company can reduce real estate costs by having smaller building with fewer offices that do not really 
belong to employees – but instead are hired out spaces when employees do not or cannot work remotely. 
 
To ensure the productivity levels, remain optimal and further increase, companies as well as employees should look 
to implement the solutions and recommendations provided in this study. Ensuring that remote working always remains 
effective requires continuous improvement and keeping up to date with global trends and technology to enhance an 
employee’s experience. Future research can be conducted relating to different samples of the population; people in 
certain age groups may feel differently due to different responsibilities in their lives. The limitation of this study is 
that it was done on employees only, and therefore the perspective on productivity levels is only from that of employees. 
An employer’s perspective will be different with different solutions and recommendations; therefore, further research 
will be required in this area.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected all industries in all over the World. Although some 
factories stopped their production activities due to the precautions, the most of privately owned Turkish 
carpet manufacturers have continued their production continuously. We have arranged several meetings 
with two credible carpet manufactures to ask for absenteeism rates of blue-collar workers. We have 
collected the data and analyzed it by comparing prepandemic conditions. We have seen that absenteeism 
rates have significantly changed. In addition, we surveyed 1258 employees from 2 carpet manufacturer 
and found that %81.31 of them have at least 1-day sick absence during the pandemic due to a real Covid 
19 or being a suspect of being Covid19 (has a contact with a Covid 19 positive person). It can be stated 
that at least for these two carpet manufacturers, absenteeism rates were relatively higher when compared 
to condition before pandemic. We have already seen some of the effects of absenteeism on the 
production quantities and some other effects are expected to be realized soon.

1. Introduction  
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged at the end of 2019 and it was announced as a Public 
Health Emergency situation at the beginning of 2020 (Tendal et al. 2021). The outbreak of COVID-19 has 
influences on the health of tens of millions of people, and is expected to affect hundreds of millions in the future 
(Li et al. 2020). On the other hand, the pandemic has not been just a global health problem it has also created 
problems about labor market and the economy (Karmaker et al. 2021). Governments across the world have closed 
some of the industries (Habib et al. 2021), self-isolation has been a legal duty as a measure against the pandemic. 
Some businesses also did not survive or their continuity was threatened (Miyakawa et al. 2021). Some employees 
lost their jobs (Sjoquist and Wheeler 2020) and some were not able to go to work places due to self-isolation or 
contact to a person who is Covid positive. At the same time, it would not be wrong to expect a rise in the sickness 
absenteeism in the companies which did not seriously lose their market due to conditions of the pandemic. It has 
been shown that absences generally lead to innumerable personal, social, and economic losses (Lima et al. 2020). 
Furthermore, absenteeism causes considerable output losses (Block et al. 2014). Although the increasing 
absenteeism can be seen as indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still don’t know about its size and 
consequences. 
  
Turkey has been the biggest exporter of machine made carpets in the World and Turkish carpet manufacturers 
export their products to more than 160 countries in the World (Öz 2004). According to the Turkey Statistical 
Institute, Turkish carpet industry made $1 billion 770 million 886 worth exports between January and September 
of 2020 and approximately %70 of these exports were made by companies operating in Gaziantep (Turkish 
Statistics Institute 2020). Total amount of exports of the carpet manufacturing industry has increased 2.31% in the 
global pandemic period. The most of the carpet manufacturing companies worked non-stop during the coronavirus 
breakup. In this work, we will provide information about the absenteeism rates of two leading carpet manufacturers 
located in Gaziantep before and after the pandemic.

4. Conclusion 
Absenteeism has been considerable problem of manufacturing companies which causes certain loss of work power 
as a resource of the firms. There is significant amount of research on this topic, focusing on the factors affecting 
the absenteeism rates. From the managerial point of view, the key issue has been the decreasing proportion of 
absenteeism that is avoidable (Vahtera et al. 2001). Currently, the world is under pressure of widely distributed 
pandemic and we can’t estimate the real cost of it to the manufacturing industry. As it can be predicted, in this 
paper, we showed that the Covid 19 break-out has increased the absenteeism rates. Even we showed that the 
difference in the rate of absenteeism is statistically significant for the period after the pandemic, we can’t prove 
that all of absenteeism is related to this pandemic. The correlation of the absenteeism with the number of positive 
cases can be significant as in case of Firm A or it can be insignificant as in Firm B. We are aware that Covid 19 
test implementations were not wide at the beginning of the pandemic and some people were stayed as untested 
even they may have some of the symptoms. Therefore, we can’t be sure of the numbers of the cases reported as 
positive. Therefore, the correlation between the positive cases and the increasing rate of absenteeism could be 
more than predicted. We have further surveyed employees to ask for the reason of their absence in order to check 
their reason for being absent during Covid 19 pandemic. 81.31% reported at least 1-day sick absence during the 
pandemic due to suspect of being Covid19 positive. 99.8% of the 14-day sick absent employees reported they 
never had such along sick absence before. 
 
In addition, we know that some people who have a contact with a Covid 19 positive person were also not allowed 
to work and stay in isolation. 40% of all (209 employees) reported a self-isolation requirement among the 1258 
employees. As a conclusion we can state that the absenteeism rates were higher and longer in duration during the 
Covid 19 pandemic. 
 
In this study, we were not able to show either the psychological effects of Covid19 on the absenteeism rates since 
there is no registered proof. Willingness of the employees to work under strict conditions of the pandemic may be 
less when compared to normal conditions. On the other hand, we have to state that both of the firms considered in 
this study pays for the output of employees, any kind of absenteeism means loss of certain amount of gain. We 
also don’t know this effect the individual decisions of the employees. We also know that team members seem to 
imitate each other’s absence behavior (ten Brummelhuis et al. 2016). Consequently, the psychological effect of 
the pandemic cannot be estimated currently; however, a survey analysis in near future can clarify the situation.  
 
There is another phenomenon that we should not forget here: Sickness presenteeism. It is the being present of an 
employee at the workplace even he/she feels ill (Bergström et al. 2009). We don’t know if the fear about being 
COVID-19, positive has decreased the sickness presenteeism but we can estimate that the cost will be higher for 
a pandemic when compared to absenteeism.

Abstract 
 
In line with the changes in higher education policy in Turkey, the number of universities in Turkey has 
considerably increased in the last decade. In this competitive environment, Turkey’s Scientific and Technological 
Research Institution (TÜBİTAK) has started to rank the universities using several academic measures such number 
of publications, number of cited articles, number of students (PhD), number of patent applications/grants and etc. 
In this work, we want to show how these academic performance indicators are affected from the experience of 
universities. We list the establishment years of the universities and calculate an age for each of the Turkish 
universities. Subsequently, we investigate how the performance indicators are correlated with the age of 
universities. As result, we show that the experience (age) is quite correlated with many of the indicators such as: 
total number of publications, total number of citations, number of projects completed however it is not the only 
factor to explain all variability in these measures.

1. Introduction 
There has been a remarkable interest in the university rankings in the recent decades. The Times Higher Education 
World University Rankings, The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), and QS World University 
Rankings are some of the well-known examples of world university rankings (N.K. et al. 2018). There numerous 
benefits of using these rankings for different purposes. First of all, these rankings create a useful benchmark data 
(Tie 2012) for the universities and it helps university managements to set some measurable objectives for the future 
of their organizations. These rankings serve also as a marketing and positioning tool within countries and around 
the globe (Hou and Jacob 2017). On the other side, they are expected to support students and their families for 
making informed decisions (Dill and Soo 2005) about their choice for higher education.  
 
Although there are different approaches for ranking universities, the most of the current rankings are simply based 
on a summation of some quality based indicators weighted with a predetermined value (Bornmann et al. 2013; 
Lukman et al. 2010). In most of these metrics, bibliometrics plays an important role (van Raan 2005). Bibliometrics 
is concerned with measuring the output of science (Battisti and Salini 2013). Since international journals are major 
means of distributing research outputs they have a dominant role in the calculation of metrics. Especially, research 
publications from the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) have relatively 
higher impact in the rankings. Some critics about idolization of these indexes can be seen in (Su 2014). Citation 
counts are another indicator of bibliometrics and they are widely employed by the ranking methodologies (Al-
Juboori et al. 2011). Patents and spin-offs are included in some of the rankings while some exclude them 
(Leydesdorff and Meyer 2010). There are also survey based statistics that are widely included by considering the 
responses collected from the graduated students. For the details of some major metrics Vught and Ziegele (2012) 
can be visited. 
 
Although there are various ranking systems discussed in the literature, national ranking approaches receives much 
more attention compared to international ones (Taylor and Braddock 2007). Turkey’s Scientific and Technological 
Research Institution (TÜBİTAK) has also started to release top 50 university rankings of Turkey on an annual 
base by 2015. The name of this ranking is called as “entrepreneurial and innovative universities” (Gür et al. 2017). 
We see the newly established and old universities in the same ranking list. Although most of the data for calculating 
the ranking is normalized to construct a fair comparison base, we think that the experience factor is omitted. There 
are universities in the list that exist more than 100 years and there are also one year old of universities in the same 
list. We expect that some measures will be higher in the in the elder universities and in this work we would like to

variation in PhD graduates can be explained with the age of universities. As shown in Figure 2, quadratic model 
can predict 68.5% of the total variation.

Correlation of the number of national patents granted with the age is 0.476 (P value 0.000). R square value is 
%21.86 for the linear model. 
 
We also checked the correlation of the rank of the universities with the age of the universities. We see that the 
correlation value is -0.523 with the p value of 0.000 (higher age means a better/smaller rank). We can conclude 
that age of a university has strong relations with the rank of universities. %27.31 of the change in rank can be 
explained the age of the universities. These findings indicate that the age of a university a good indicator of the 
experiences for many performance criteria. The results also indicate that rank of Sabancı University slight better 
than expected and it over performs when compared to its age.  
         
Conclusion 
Academic performance indicators such as number of papers published is expected to be influenced by several 
factors including the experience. This experience is not only the experience of the individuals; it is also the 
traditions arising from cultural climate of the universities. However, little is known regarding the influence of 
experience on these indicators. In this work, we see the age of a university as the proxy of experience and check 
if the academic measures are correlated with the age of universities. The results indicate that the number of 
publications, number of citations, number of projects, number of granted patents and the number of PhD graduates 
are positively correlated to age of the universities. We can infer that the statistics tend to be significantly different 
for the different ages of the universities. Most of these indicator values increase as the age of the university 
increases. We have two different categories of unusual observations. The first one is about the elder universities 
with relatively lower performances. The second category is the relatively higher performances although the 
university is a young one. If these rankings are assumed to be an indicator of the success, we believe that the 
second category of unusual observations should be announced as the success stories. In other words, the 
universities should be compared and ranked with the similar universities (we mean the age similarity). We have to 
state that there is a significant limitation of this work due to sparsely available data and these findings indicate a 
relation however we cannot infer causality directly.  
 
Although there are lots of studies on academic ranking, the interrelations between the indicators has not been 
widely considered. We hypothesize that there are some certain dependencies among these indicators. These 
dependencies can be checked in future work.

Abstract 
 
This paper examines the effects of positive or negative residual values on the supply chain participants’ 
decisions. The supply chain consists of a cash-strapped manufacturer, a reputable retailer, and a financial 
institution. Two financing tools are considered to address the manufacturer's financial difficulties. It is 
found that, firstly, positive and negative residual values affect the optimal order quantity. Secondly, 
residual values have an impact on the profits of each supply chain member. The threshold value of the 
retailer's internal asset level is related to the residual value under the condition of single financing 
equilibrium. Finally, the results are verified by some numerical experiments.

1. Introduction 
Supply chain parties often face working capital constraints in ordering and production decisions, 
especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Vandenberg 2003), and they may not be able 
to get loans from financial institutions (Kouvelis and Zhao 2012). To solve this problem, supply chain 
finance (SCF) emerged to help the enterprises obtain funds. In the past few years, SCF services have 
been widely adopted worldwide, especially in developing countries. When liquidity is tight, companies

7. Conclusion 
We study a supply chain system with a cash-strapped manufacturer and analyze the supply chain 
participants’ optimal decisions and financing strategies with considering positive and negative residual 
values. To solve the manufacturer's financial difficulties, the manufacturer can use BPOF and APD. Our 
research yielded some important results. In the clearance period, considering different residual values, 
the retailer's optimal order quantity is different. Specifically, compared with orders with no residual 
value, an order with a positive residual value can reduce the loss of the retailer, which will make the 
buyer gain more profits. On the contrary, orders with negative residual values increase losses, resulting 
in lower profits. Therefore, in the SCF system, the retailer is more likely to order products with high 
positive residual values from the manufacturer. Moreover, when residual values are high, the retailer 
should have higher asset levels to ensure that there is sufficient capital to provide financing to the 
manufacturer. 
 
Future research directions mainly include the following aspects: 1) Future research can explore supply 
chain coordination with other contracts; 2) Risk preferences of supply chain participants can be 
considered in future models; 3) In real life, information asymmetry exists among supply chain 
participants, which needs to be further solved.

Abstract 
This work focused on the assessment of budget practices applied in the manufacturing sector. 
Two companies in the sector, Company A and Company B were used as the case studies where 
the budget implications for producing 100 500 pallets of a lager beer and 200 000 pallets of baby 
cereal respectively. The budget planning process, budget development, types of budget to be 
used were discussed. The short range type of budget over a monthly period was chosen. From the 
analysis: the budget implications in the manufacturing sector are highly depended on the direct 
materials, direct labor and plant overheads budgets.

1. Introduction 
Budgeting is critical for financial planning in the manufacturing sector to ensure that the planned capacity is met 
without financial problems (Hogaboam and Shook, 2004). The budget is developed through accessing and analyzing 
historical data in the previous production years. After that there is connection between manufacturing firm’s 
strategic objectives with the daily financial processes. In the manufacturing sector there is need to link the top-down 
targets with the bottom-up budgets. There is also need to integrate financial statements as manufacturing conditions 
change regularly such labor costs, overhead costs and materials costs (Hermes et al., 2006). There is therefore need 
for continuous forecasting during budgeting in manufacturing systems. This study focused on assessment of 
budgeting practices applied in the manufacturing sector with a focus on the budget planning process, the budget 
development process and the budget management. Two manufacturing firms, one in the beer production sector: 
Company A and another one in the cereal production sector: Company B was considered.  
2. Budget Planning Process 
The budgeting, planning and forecasting process is a three-step strategic planning process for determining and 
detailing a manufacturing firm's long and short-term financial goals (Graham and Campbell, 2001). The process is 
usually managed by a manufacturing firm's Finance Department with the Chief Executive Officer’s guidance. The 
three steps involved include: planning outlines the company's financial direction and creates a model of expectations 
for the next 3-5 years and often the first step in setting up a company. In addition, budgeting documents show how

The overhead budget splits overhead costs into fixed and variable overhead. The variable overhead is multiplied by 
the number of units produced and then added to the fixed overhead. This total estimated overhead can be used to 
project the future costs of production. Table 3 shows the various plant overhead costs for both Company A and 
Company B.

9. Conclusion 
Budgeting is key in the manufacturing sector for its optimal operation. For the sector to continually thrive, the 
budget planning process, the development process and the nature of the budget required must be identified. In 
addition, approaches to the budgeting must be done in order to cater for direct material labor, direct labor and plant 
overheads must be accounted for. Lastly, the budget period must be identified the budget managed throughout for 
successful operation.

Abstract 
The outbreak of Covid-19 resulted in the immediate and unplanned closure of universities across the world. This 
resulted in cancellation of classes, graduation ceremonies resulting in reduced job prospects, increased 
uncertainties for students and in ability to cope with online lessons. An evaluation of these detailed impacts at 
Harare Institute of Technology in Zimbabwe indicated that serious measures in terms of fast internet, availability 
for electronic gadgets for learning, affordable date and ICT friendly infrastructure must be put in place. In addition, 
universities need to seriously review their teaching curricula so that it has both physical and online learning 
methods options as Covid-19 is here to stay. Furthermore, to consider virtual research groups.

1. Introduction 
Covid-19 was first recognized in the Hubei Province, City of Wuhan, China in late 2019 (Sansa, 2020). Soon 
after, Covid-19 began to wreak havoc and the devastating effects of the pandemic forced the WHO to declare it 
as a global pandemic (Guan et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020; UNDP, 2020). Afterwards there was a declared global 
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) by March 2020. However, compared with the SARS-CoV 
that caused an outbreak of SARS in 2003 (Ksiazek et al., 2003), Covid-19 has a stronger transmission capacity 
(Horby et al., 2020). As of June 23 2020, infections had risen to 9.1 million and over 472 700 deaths associated 
with the disease globally (Dong et al., 2020).  
The symptoms for Covid-19 can fever, coughing and shortness of breath (WHO, 2020). In severe cases, infection 
can cause pneumonia and breathing difficulties and the disease can be fatal. Covid-19 symptoms are similar to 
the flu or the common cold, which is a lot more common than Covid-19 hence the need for testing to confirm if 
someone has Covid-19. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected 
person generated through coughing and sneezing (Nishiura et al., 2020). Individuals can also be infected from 
touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and touching their face (e.g. nose, eyes and mouth). The Covid-19 
virus survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it (Nishiura et al., 2020).  Older people, 
and people with chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, appear to be more at risk of 
developing severe symptoms (Lloyd-Sherlock et al. 2020). As this is a new virus, its impact on children is still 
being investigated, however, there are few cases of Covid-19 related deaths reported among children (Lee et al., 
2020).  
At present, with no antivirals to cure Covid-19 infections, several drugs have been proposed to treat patients 
including remdesivir, lopinavir, emetine, chloroquine, dexamethasone, etc. with many at clinical phase (Costanzo 
et al., 2020) owing to their antiviral activities in vitro (Choy et al., 2020). Moreover, synthetic corticosteroids have 
been recommended to treat severe cases of Covid-19 (Horby et al., 2020) with their treatment use accounting for 
up to 50% (Wang et al., 2020) and found to aid striking recovery for patients on ventilators, and, good 
improvement to those receiving oxygen but not on ventilators with concomitant 20% death reduction (Horby et 
al., 2020). As with other respiratory infections like the flu or the common cold, public health measures are critical 
to slow the spread of illnesses. These preventative measures which are related to the need for changes in social

The effect of Covid-19 on universities poses a lot of challenges to universities and requires a lot of adjustments. 
Measures should be taken to ensure that students will be able to make up for the learning loss they experienced 
during the lockdown. Alternative methods of delivering teaching and learning including a mixed learning system 
with physical and online elements should be put in place. The future of university education it requires a change 
in both the quantity and quality of the teaching capacity, a revision in the curriculum and the structure of many 
existing university buildings to maintain physical distancing. Guaranteed access to internet, availability of 
electronic gadgets, increased access to fast internet and proper ICT tools are basic fundamentals in universities 
during and post the Covid-19 era.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents an advancement of an academic computer-aided design software system tool for the shell and tube 
heat exchanger project. The project is teaching a Visual Basic, user-friendly Application (VBA) programming in 
chemical engineering at Elmergib University with a focus on a unit operation project selected from chemical 
engineering design core courses. The course is designed to teach not solely the way to program, however additionally 
on problem-solving and the way to convert a chemical engineering problem into an operating software package 
program. Many chemical engineering issues were designated as either projects or demonstrations to permit students 
to gain expertise and advantages of programming in VBA. The central importance of sensible provision and style 
project, and also the approaches adopted by new suppliers to deliver these parts, are reviewed, alongside the role of 
software system tools in chemical engineering education, and measures to facilitate business input into courses. As to 
inhibit innovation, the certification process provides constructive steerage and leverage for universities developing 
new chemical engineering programs. Most chemical engineers getting into the work spend a minimum of half of their 
workday at their computers, which principally involves the utilization of easy industrial software.

1. Introduction  
Academic teaching has been traditionally focused on the theoretical instruction delivered in classroom lectures. 
However, chemical engineering design course tasks and their data processing and model evaluation are time-
consuming. They are not adding much value to the student’s learning experience as they reduce the available time for 
result analysis, critical thinking, and report writing skills development. In addition, a well-known issue that processing 
experimental knowledge and examination of results against theoretical models are often time-consuming because of 
repetitive and complicated calculations. That holds back the student’s available time for analysis and discussion 
resulting into a poor-quality report. This project aims to initiate the teaching of Excel VBA programming in chemical 
engineering, with the emphasis on relevant examples/projects. The programming paradigm behind this project is 
structural programming with a divide and conquer strategy (Albright 2001). VBA has both procedural and object-
oriented features. The Excel VBA programming part has been run as a trial within some chemical engineering 
undergraduate courses. Therefore, this project addressed this issue by selecting several experiences of the design 
process namely: applied theories behind thermo-hydraulic design analysis with practical mechanical design details 
required for costing and production and developed programming skills using individual spreadsheets (Serth 
and Lestina 2010). These spreadsheets are organized in such a way to process a design algorithm, evaluate complex 
analytical and numerical graphs models and correlations (Chapra 2003), and convey results in tables and plots. 
Chemical engineering students that tested the spreadsheets were surveyed and expressed the added value of the sheets, 
being user-friendly. They helped them to fulfil engineering design objectives by reducing their hand calculation 
workload. They allowed them to complete detailed analyses that instructors could not request before as they were able 
to quickly evaluate, compare and validate different model assumptions and correlations (Chapra 2003). Students also

4. Conclusion  
The engineering student team of HED design response to the use of VBA within this project has been excellent. Great 
welcome the opportunity of adding a new package to their credit of proficiencies. The spreadsheets that were presented 
in this project were well-programmed, for assisting the data processing of the complex heat exchanger model design 
evaluation tasks. Analytical and numerical solutions of different models were well comprised of those spreadsheets, 
as well as correlations available in the literature. A survey was conducted on the five chemical engineering students 
group who tested the spreadsheets, showing that spreadsheets were considered useful for reducing workload and 
boosting analyses quality where they earned the expertise of possibility of quickly rehearsing with diverse correlations 
and models. The students also gave valuable suggestions and feedback to improve the spreadsheet experience, such 
as incorporating more correlations and models and examples into the user manuals, which will be considered for the 
next stage of this project by creating a spreadsheet for each unit in the design laboratory course. Finally, the goal of 
updating the teaching and learning experience of chemical engineering students at the design course through 
computers was fulfilled by the introduction of these spreadsheets, without the need for students to acquire any more 
programming skills courses. This can be considered a practical advantage, as it would allow other fellow communities 
to benefit from this work into their graduation project proposals.

Abstract  
 
The agricultural sector may reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions derived from fossil fuels combustion, contributing 
to achieving the European Union environmental decarbonization targets set for 2030. In this context, biomethane has 
a growing interest as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels in term of CO2 emission. In particular, according to the 
2009/28/EC European Unione Directive, emissions from the fuel in use shall be considered to be zero for biofuels and 
bioliquids. For this reason, CO2 emissions produced from biomethane combustion can be regarded as highly promising 
to increase agricultural sustainability. This study aims to propose a theoretical approach to estimate the amount of CO2 
emissions of agricultural tractors' fleet and a method to calculate the amount of biomethane required to replace fossil 
fuel. The method of estimation of the CO2 emitted by tractors is based on the amount of tax-reduced fuel consumed 
each year in an area, then the amount of biomethane required to replace Diesel fuel used by agricultural tractors in the 
same area is calculated. The method has been applied to the Piedmont Region, NW Italy, retrieving figures from an 
official open-access online regional database where the consumption of Diesel fuel is recorded year by year. The 
amount of biomethane necessary to achieve the European environmental goals in terms of CO2 emissions reduction is 
estimated by adopting a methane emissions factor. After introducing the theoretical approach, the paper describes the 
different steps of the method from the Diesel fuel consumption data retrieving to the following calculation for CO2 
emission and the biomethane estimation for the Diesel fuel replacement.

Abstract 
The aim of this study is to determine an optimal new factory location for a company based on the proximity of the new factory’s location 
to its customers and, in turn, reduce the cost related to deliveries. This was carried out using the transportation algorithm via the excel 
solver tool. This takes into account variables such as  distance from customers, weight of the goods, as well as vehicle-based and driver-
based costs, in order to determine the most cost effective location of a new factory. The current factory for the company case study is 
based in Pinetown and Kwa-Zulu Natal in South Africa. The proposed factory locations are Pietermaritzburg, Durban Central or another 
in Pinetown, all within Kwa-Zulu Natal. Based on the results, the optimal location to establish a new factory would be Pietermaritzburg, 
KwaZulu Natal. This location combined with the current factory location will generate the lowest cost with regards to vehicle-based 
and driver-based costs when delivering goods.

Introduction 
The location of a business is an important aspect to consider when analysing the idea of setting up a new factory or premises. The factors 
which can influence the location include the access to market (such as customers), inputs (such as employees, suppliers, and knowledge), 
accessibility, and costs (McQuaid, et al., 2003). When looking at access to market it is important to take into account the transportation 
factor when determining location. 
Transportation has become an essential activity for most business (Goldsby, et al., 2014). It is an essential activity which provides the 
economic utilities of place and time. Place being the idea that customers have the product available where they require it and time being 
that customers have access to the product when they need it (Goldsby, et al., 2014). When looking at these utilities there are costs 
involved in both. There are three areas of cost in transport, namely, operational cost and freight transportation cost functions, value of 
time, and external costs (Izadi, et al., 2019). When looking at operational costs in transport in can be separated into two different groups. 
These groups being vehicle-based cost factors and driver-based cost factors (Izadi, et al., 2019). According to Izadi, et al. (2019), 
vehicle-based cost consist of fuel and engine oil, truck/trialer lease or purchase, maintence and repairs, fuel tax, insurance premiums, 
tyres, licensing and permint, and tolls. Driver-based costs include driver wages, benefits and bonuses. 
According to Richards (1962) transportation costs can be seen to be made up of two functions, these being weight and distance. It has 
also been noted that based on this idea that the value of a product at the place of production decreases as the distance from the market 
increases (Richards, 1962). These points metioned above show a connection in transportation costs and the ditance that a factory may

452","It is important to note that the number of tonnes allocated to the dummy column shows the number of available tonnes the factory can 
still supply should there be an increase in demand from an existing or new customer. A summary of the total costs can be seen in Table 
6 below. 
Table 6 – Combination Costs 
Combination 
Total Cost

R 47 031.70 
Current factory and Pinetown 
R 68 345.40 
Current factory and Durban 
R 72 603.00 
 
As per Table 6, above, it can be noted that the combination of the current factory and a second factory in Durban would generate the 
highest total cost, the current factory and a second factory in Pinetown would generate the second highest total cost, while the current 
factory and another in Pietermaritzburg would give the lowest total cost. 
Conclusion  
As mentioned above this study takes into account vehicle-based costs and driver-based costs when looking for the optimal location of 
a new factory. These, however, are not the only costs that a company should consider when looking at a location. Other costs such as 
access to suppliers, employees and knowledge should be considered. 
Based on the data seen in Table 6, the optimal location to set up a new factory would be in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal. This 
location combined with the current factory location will generate the lowest cost with regards to vehicle-based and driver-based costs 
when delivering goods as the majority of the customers are based closer to Pietermaritzburg. Due to the nature of this paper, further 
studies should take into account other cost factors such as location of suppliers, employees and knowledge (such as specialists) in order 
to gain a better analysis of all costs involved in determining the location of a new factory.

Abstract 
 
Sectorization refers to partitioning a large territory, network, or area into smaller parts or sectors considering one or 
more objectives. Sectorization problems appear in diverse realities and applications. For instance, political districting, 
waste collection, maintenance operations, forest planning, health or school districting are only some of the application 
fields. Commonly, sectorization problems respect a set of features necessary to be preserved to evaluate the solutions. 
These features change for different sectorization applications. Thus, it is important to conceive the needs and the 
preferences of the decision-makers about the solutions. In the current paper, we solve sectorization problems using 
the Genetic Algorithm by considering three objectives: equilibrium, compactness, and contiguity. These objectives 
are collected within a single composite objective function to evaluate the solutions over generations. Moreover, the 
Analytical Hierarchy Process, a powerful method to perceive the relative importance of several objectives regarding 
decision makers' preferences, is used to construct the weights. We observe the changes in the solutions by considering 
different sectorization problems that prioritize various objectives. The results show that the solutions' progress 
changed accurately to the given importance of each objective over generations.

1. Introduction  
 
Sectorization means dividing into sectors or parts, which arises in many contexts and applications, usually to achieve 
some goal or to facilitate an activity. Most of the time, this division or partition aims to better organize or simplify a 
massive problem into smaller sub-problems or promote groups with similar characteristics. 
 
Sectorization is a very important matter due to the wide range of application areas. The application areas are diverse 
and often arise related to geographical issues. Examples include designing political districts, sales territories, school, 
health and policing zones, forest planning, municipal waste collection or street cleaning zones and maintaining 
operations (see. Bozkaya et al. 2003, Augstin-Blas et al. 2009, Rios-Mercado and Bard 2019). 
 
The study of sectorization problems is still quite relevant to society and science since they do not have an easy or 
universal solution. The solution methods used are highly dependent on specific cases. Commonly, they include a set 
of features that should be preserved in the construction or evaluation of sectors. The examples are 
equilibrium (identical proportion of the parts in relation to the whole), contiguity (each sector should represent one 
part instead of a spread of small parts) and, compactness (sectors showing regular shapes, circles, or squares, avoiding 
tentacle) (Kalcsics et al. 2005). Preserving these features requires involving them in the solution procedure as objective

460",,"We used GA to solve sectorization problems under different weighting schemes. The results show that the solutions 
advance in a different direction, more proper to each objective's given importance, over generations. These results 
show the relevance of AHP to demonstrate the decision-makers' influence on the solutions when the weighing system 
is altered regarding their preferences. 
 
Furthermore, given the data scarcity, we generate our instances and make them available. In total, 50 instances, 
including coordinates, quantities, and contiguity maps, are produced following gamma distribution.

Abstract  
 
In today's world, environmental sensitivity increases with the overuse of energy and the increasing pollution in parallel 
with this situation, consistently. In this context, Green Vehicle Routing Problem attracts the attention of researchers 
as it is a scientific research problem that takes awareness of environmental impact and resource efficiency into account 
simultaneously. This paper investigates literature related to frequently used objective functions, constraints, fleet type, 
number of depots, parameter uncertainty and solution techniques in GVRPs. This study covers publications between 
2011 and 2021 including 72 papers. The distinctness of this paper lies in highlighting the main features of GVRP that 
provide the direction of the development of researches.

1. Introduction  
Today, as a result of human activities, the world is in a rapid technological change. While this change provides 
important advantages in people's life, it causes serious damage to the environment in another dimension. These 
generated environmental problems have ceased to be regional and threaten the future of living things on a global scale, 
so it has become a situation that remains the agenda of everyone. This situation has prompted to impose the legal and 
social sanctions to protect the natural environment. For this reason, businesses have tended to develop environmental 
policies. These sanctions directly affect road transportation in particular. Because the road transportation is one of the 
elements which causes most of the environmental issues like greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fuel consumption etc. 
in logistic sector. At this juncture, the concept of Green Logistics comes into view. 
 
One of the types of problems that are examined within the scope of Green Logistics is Green Vehicle Routing Problem 
(GVRP). GVRP is a precious cost item for businesses since it optimizes the distribution network activities where 
constraints are created by considering environmental considerations while provided services to customers. Therefore, 
distribution networks which considers environmental objectives as well as economic benefits have been established 
in recent years. These established distribution networks and their vehicle routes are evaluated by many researchers 
and environmentalists. 
 
The aim of this study is to conduct a literature review on studies dealing with Green Vehicle Routing Problem, 
frequently used objective functions and constraints, vehicle fleet type, number of depots, uncertainty of the models 
and solution methodologies. The scientific contributions of this literature review for academic researches: (1) It 
provides a detailed examination of studies considering GVRP and it is the most recent study due to this study covers 
studies which published in 2021 year. (2) This study examines the number of objective functions, the type of objective

Abstract 
 
Developing technologies in customer analytics provide several opportunities to retailers. Analyzing customer 
movements in the stores as a part of customer analytics can reveal various shopping behaviors. It facilitates to 
understand better customers' visit purposes. This study applies four sequential mining algorithms, CMRules, CMDeo, 
ERMiner, and RuleGrowth, to analyze the visit purposes of customers in a supermarket. Moreover, it compares 
variations among different visits belonging to the same customers. This study concludes three main results. First, it 
indicates that customers prefer visiting the supermarket not only for their specific needs but also for all their needs at 
every visit. Second, the ERMiner algorithm is faster than the other algorithms. Third, customers who visit 
{Construction, Kitchen} and {Sanitary ware, Garden} bought at least one product with a high probability. Moreover, 
this study describes the concept of interesting rule, which has a lower support value and higher confidence value. 
Customers can visit the supermarket for various purposes resulting in different interesting rules. As an interesting rule 
in the second visit, purchased customers visited Construction, Garden and Kitchen aisles before leaving the 
supermarket whereas this rule did not appear in the first visits. Customers visited the Construction aisle more after 
they visited the Entrance and Ironmongery aisles in their second visit.

1. Introduction 
Advanced technologies have been rapidly developed in the ever-shifting global retail domain (Adapa et al. 2020; 
Daunt and Harris 2017; Ferracuti et al. 2019). Some retailer companies are confused by technology-based possibilities 
and use technologies without a precise perception of customer needs (Inman and Nikolova 2017). Customer analytics 
has obtained speedup in the last decades (Bonacchi and Perego 2019; Kitchens et al. 2018) thanks to the development 
of recent high-level technologies, including new channels and tools (Herhausen et al. 2019). There is a greater demand 
than ever before to serve shoppers, leveraging a vast volume of customer data using customer analytics technologies 
(Sun et al. 2014; Wedel and Kannan 2016). Customer analytics serves to gain advantages for retailer companies 
regarding various perspectives such as sales forecasting, marketing, segmentation, dynamic pricing and churn 
prediction. 
Knowing aisles visited by customers in a supermarket involves closely examining customer analytics because it helps 
to uncover information such as customer shopping behaviors and bottlenecks. First of all, collecting customers' 
location data is necessary to understand customer visit purposes. Data can be collected in several ways, such as WiFi, 
RFID and Bluetooth. Dogan and Oztaysi (2018) showed that Bluetooth-based devices are the most appropriate data

485",,"In most cases, determining the minimum support value is problematic because it is generally selected by the trial-and-
error method. The top-k sequential rules can be discovered from the same supermarket dataset as future work to handle 
this challenge. Furthermore, to avoid redundant rules, which are a variation of other rules with the same support and 
confidence values, the top-k non-redundant sequential rules method can be used for this study.

Abstract 
 
Supplier-specific investment is a strategic decision that involves cost and benefit. In order to meet the 
needs of buyers in outsourcing certain business processes, suppliers are required to be responsive to 
buyer's requirements to make specific investments to meet the needs of each buyer. Both buyer and 
supplier should not be concerned only with the level of risk they are willing to tolerate but also realize 
the benefit of those strategic decision. For that reason, the factors affecting suppliers’ investment specific 
should be taken into consideration. This study attempts to develop a conceptual framework in relation to 
the dynamics of economic and social factors determining suppliers’ specific investment on business 
process outsourcing. We do this by adding relational social capital as social factor which formed 
suppliers’ specific investment. We also incorporates environmental uncertainty as moderating factors. 
Our conceptual model provides a way for firms and researchers to take a more systematic and 
comprehensive approach to understand suppliers’ specific investment decisions. We conclude with a 
discussion of using both buyer and supplier perspective on future empirical studies.

Abstract 
 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) becomes more important day by day as a result of technological 
developments. Besides improving their internal processes for customer satisfaction, companies especially with a high 
number of customers seek intelligent and well-designed methods for handling their customers by analyzing their 
behaviors and revealing their patterns. Companies transform their repetitive processes to Robotic Process Automation 
(RPA) by integrating systems based on intelligence, data mining, and machine learning techniques to save time, reveal 
patterns in data more easily, build robust interrelationships within the functions of the company, etc. As a part of these 
efforts, this study proposes an integrated CRM methodology to manage both Business to Business (B2B) and Business 
to Customer (B2C) relations. In the integrated approach, Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis divides 
the customers into segments that define their current status, DBSCAN Cluster Analysis verifies RFM Analysis and 
reveals the anomalies in the data fur further analysis, and Decision Tree Classification Algorithm predicts company-
specific custom questions to ease the work of analysts. A Case Study on the data from AN-EL A.S. (an electrical 
components company) verifies that the methodology produces segments of the customers and predictive responses to 
custom questions to enable the analysts to carry out their actions easily. According to the results of the case study, 34 
% of the customers should be contacted to detail the status of the business in terms of sample approval, new purchase 
order, arrangement of batch size etc.

1. Introduction 
The share of E-commerce within total global retail sales is continuously increasing and expected to be nearly 20 % 
where it has been 7.4 % in 2015 (Statistica, 2021). In conjunction with many other aspects like technological 
developments and advances in logistic capabilities, E-commerce has changed the end customer behavior from a 
classical store purchase to an elective and comparative purchase strategy. Today, customers can easily search for and 
evaluate many alternatives with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Supported Engines on the internet. Quality 
alone is no longer a sufficient criterion to satisfy customer demands. Retailers should provide many alternatives to be 
compared and in case of purchase, the product should be delivered at reasonable times. With a bullwhip effect, all 
stakeholders of the supply chains have been widely affected by this behavioral change. The Make-to-Stock (MTS) 
policy has widely lost its dominance on the Make-to-Order (MTO) policy that caused the adaptation of many 
production plants to Just in Time (JIT) production independent from being Business to Customer (B2C) or Business 
to Business (B2B). As a holistic result of this progress, the focus of the producers shifted from product to customer. 
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is the generally accepted term to define the combination of people,

5. Conclusions and Future Research 
In this study, we have proposed a comprehensive methodology for customer segmentation and revealing responses to 
company-specific questions concerning customer patterns. RFM Analysis provides plain segmentation information 
that constitutes an insight regarding the membership status of the customers. Without any further detail, the customer 
may be grouped in terms of status. DBSCAN Cluster analysis improves the accuracy of RFM analysis and detects 
outliers in the dataset. Outliers are unordinary customers that behave distinctly compared to remaining customers. 
Distinct behaviors of outliers should be analyzed with further efforts to better understand the customers. At the final 
stage, the Decision Tree Classification Algorithm eases the work of analysts by revealing replies to custom questions. 
These specific questions clearly state the actions to be taken concerning each customer. The novelty of this study is 
providing a holistic approach to B2B and B2C CRM management by a methodology of segmentation, outlier 
detection, and responding to customer-related custom questions. Revealing all these data may be possible with intense 
manual analysis. However, this process would consume a meaningful time every time the analysis is carried out.  The 
methodology can currently provide membership and classification data considering the features of the study. CRM is 
widely applied to B2C and not common for B2B. The study also proves that CRM may be applied easily to B2B 
analysis. For future study, the methodology may be enhanced by adding forecasting techniques to suggest possible 
future actions that may be carried out by the customers.

Abstract 
 
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has enabled many new avenues for industrial engineers to perform their jobs. There 
used to be a need for an engineer to monitor, analyze, and improve a process manually. The inherent benefit of IIoT 
applications in industrial settings no longer requires in-person contact. Through the use of sensors, actuators, and data 
communication networks, businesses can now automate the data collection process to achieve KPIs. With this digital 
revolution comes the ability to access the data and improve the process from anywhere in the world. While IIoT brings 
many advantages that may improve a process improvement team's efficiency, it is not without some drawbacks such 
as security and cost. This paper will explore how IIoT enables remote improvements and how the COVID-19 
pandemic has made remote work a fiscal possibility for many businesses.

IIoT, Process Improvement, Remote Work, COVID-19 
1. Introduction  
IIoT systems are sensors, actuators, and data communication software integrated into a singular system. Under the 
umbrella of data visualization, engineers can completely monitor equipment from a single computer in real-time. In 
the adolescent stages of the industrial revolution, manufacturing facilities would run machines until a critical failure 
stopped production. Mechanics would then diagnose the failure and replace the motor, spindle, PLC, etc., to continue 
production. Current best practices now differ from traditional production as the cost of stopping the manufacturing 
process from rectifying poor asset management outweighs the financial upkeep IIoT demands. While the upfront costs 
of Industry 4.0 (mentioned later in the report) deter business leaders from funding next-generation facilities, IoT 
benefits not only apply to the bottom dollar of the business over time but allow engineers to work from all parts of the 
globe in national pandemic scenarios. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The objectives of the paper are as follows: 
1. Create a hypothetical scenario in which a business could apply IoT to a pre-existing facility 
2. Analyze potential technologies within IoT to said business 
3. Create a cost-benefit analysis with ROI projection to validate the implementation

509","6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the transition to an IIoT integrated work environment. 
Companies now have begun to realize the importance of incorporating IIoT in their business for the benefits they 
offer. With the push from COVID-19, industries inch closer towards ""Industry 4.0"", which relies heavily on IIoT, 
autonomous systems, and machine learning.  
 
In the example of SLO Aerospace, the engineers were able to identify issues within the current facility and propose 
an effective solution to senior leadership. From there, the executives noticed that not only could the technology save 
the business's bottom line but prevent facility shutdown from global pandemics. Engineers can now securely log into 
the facility data communication network and make adjustments to critical assets from their home's comfort. While a 
mass-scale implementation plan like SLO Aerospace is not feasible for some production facilities, engineers should 
carefully examine IoT benefits and compare the potential outcomes to propose accurate savings models to the business.

Abstract 
Traffic police riders are exposed to prolonged static posture, causing significant angular deviation of body 
muscles, including lumbar angle (L1-L5). This postural alteration contributes to muscle discomfort, especially 
low back pain (LBP), since it is one of the most severe modern diseases nowadays. This study aims to develop a 
prototype (lumbar support with built-in massager system) of motorcycle seat for traffic police riders to precisely 
transform riders' need with comfort. There are three stages (Stage 1: Problem identification, Stage 2: Prototype 
development, and Stage 3: Prototype testing) involved in this study. A 100 mm visual analogue scale rating was 
used to assess the discomfort ratings of this prototype. The prototype testing showed good indicators in reducing 
riders' discomfort (31%) compared with the existing motorcycle seat. The majority of the items were statistically 
significant difference between the existing seat and prototype seat, namely the seat length, seat contour, vibration, 
physical design, tendency to slide, with/without lumbar support as well as massager, the pressure under the 
buttock, lower back, middle back, upper back, side of the body, buttock, and overall discomfort (p<0.05). A 
prototype (lumbar support with built-in massager system) does offer an alternative solution to improve motorcycle 
seat design ergonomically. It enhances the reduction of overall body discomfort on police riders. However, a 
further evaluation of the in-depth field, laboratory and clinical testing should be carried out to support the 
effectiveness of the prototype.

1. Introduction  
Low back pain has been affecting the world with a high recurrence rate and caused the loss of function and 
disability (Hartvigsen et al., 2018). This disorder usually affects vehicle users, especially motorcyclists, as the 
current feature of a motorcycle seat still lacks in providing good posture support for the riders (Arunachalam et 
al., 2019). Sitting discomfort of a motorcycle has become a crucial issue and needs to be distinguished due to the 
limited space, more restriction to posture, prolonged riding, and multiple tasks, which can lead to muscle 
discomfort and musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) (Yusof et al., 2016). Previous studies found that approximately 
50% of the traffic police officers use motorcycles as their main vehicle while on duty (Diyana et al., 2019; Yusof 
et al., 2016). The traffic police force in Malaysia is under the Department of Investigation and Traffic Enforcement 
which is one of the main components of the Malaysian Royal Police (MRP). Traffic police riders represent one 
of the most critical subcomponents in this department. They are responsible for escorting, patrolling selected 
locations, and fine any offence of road users in their eight to 12-hours working shift. From a previous research

Abstract 
The huge cost and high labor demand associated with the current deep litter system of poultry farming 
poses a great challenge to poultry farming. These drawbacks which currently threatens this system of 
farming, have been attributed to the over-involvement of humans in almost all aspects of operation of this 
farming system. The consequences are increased disease outbreak, weakness and poor bird feeding. To 
ameliorated some of these challenges, an automated poultry feeding system is developed and presented in 
this paper. The proposed system mimics the roles of real-life poultry attendants in delivery of feed and 
water to birds at specified interval of time. The system senses the level of feed and water in the respective 
trough and intelligently dispense water and feed in response to the sensed levels. The current system is 
able to effectively sense and predict the level of feed and water in the farm at an accuracy of 98.79% and 
dispense same within a response time of 50-60ms.

1. Introduction 
Poultry farming currently serves as major source of protein production for human consumption. It has overtime 
created employment and revenue for stakeholders involved in the business. As such, the need to ensure its proper 
management cannot be overemphasized (Barcho, 2019; Olaniyi et al, 2014; Adedinsewo, 2004; Arulogun, 2010; 
Grothmann, 2010). Efficient management of poultry nutrition has been established as a major factor that accounts 
for the success of the poultry business (Adedinsewo, 2004). 
 
According to (Olaniyi et al, 2014), 75% of production cost in poultry farm is due to feeding. Similarly, the extensive 
use of human labor in almost all aspect for the daily running of the farm increases the cost of production. The 
current deep litter system of poultry farming has been established to be characterized by improper administration of 
feed, wastage of feed, unfavorable weather conditions, stress associated with manual labor, increased tendency of 
disease outbreak, fatigue and stress (Hung, 2014; Reyes et al, 2015; Duy et al, 2015). 
 
In an effort to ameliorate some of these challenges, technologies have over-time been developed in order to 
automate several aspects of this system of farming. See section II for details. Though, several technologies have 
been developed in an effort to automating the feed dispensing system of poultry farms, many of such systems have 
been inefficient and unstable hence resulting in malnutrition and increase risk of disease outbreak in many farms. 
Thus, the present study seeks to develop an automated feeding system for poultry farms that cater for these 
challenges.

532","3.2. System Communication and Control Description 
Communication between the hardware’s was realized through a program written on a controller. For this study, we 
adopted the Arduino Uno (Chinaeke-Ogbuka, 2019, Amadi, 2019) based on the Microchip ATmega328P 
microcontroller as shown in Fig 7. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that 
may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The ATmega328 on the board is 
preprogrammed with a boot loader thereby allowing the upload of new codes to it without needing external 
hardware programmer. While the Uno communicates using the original STK500 protocol, it is different from all 
earlier boards because it does not use the FTDI USB-to-serial driver chip. Rather, it makes use of the Atmega16U2 
programmed as a USB-to-serial. For this task, a C-language program was written on a computer using the Arduino 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for controlling the working of the system. The program was uploaded 
to the microcontroller through a serial port interface from the programming circuit of the microcontroller to the 
serial port of the computer with the aid of the Arduino. The program flow diagram is as shown in Fig.8. 
4. Implementation and Testing of the Design 
The overall circuit of the design comprises of the different sub-circuits of the individual units (Modules) all 
connected to the microcontroller via the Arduino Uno. The functions of these individual units were harmonized 
through a written program on the ATmega328P microcontroller. The prototype design was implemented physically 
as shown in Fig. 9. The individual components that make up the entire system were tested separately before 
integrating them together. All the interfacing units were tested separately as well to ensure closer specifications 
required for proper functioning of the system, and also to check the continuity of the connections that link the 
individual components. Reliability testing for the system was carried for 3-days and a mean reliability value of 
0.5064 was obtained.

5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
In this study, we designed and implemented an effective, user-friendly automatic feeding system for poultry farms 
with a view of remedying the current challenges associated with poultry farming especially as it regards the high 
cost associated with personnel. The developed system also improves power management in the farm. The system

microcontroller via the Arduino Uno. Compared with other conventional methods, this system shows excellent 
performance with its advanced digital technology and it is more effective as it saves both time and energy. Overall, 
it greatly reduces personnel cost. While the current system is only designed to automate the feeding systems for 
subsistence poultry farms, the present study failed to cater for other section that could incur man power cost such as 
health, waste management and ventilation systems. It is hoped that further studies will explore a cross- platform 
approach to these areas.

Abstract 
 
This study explores the effect of the power outage and global economic recession crises on green human resource 
management (GHRM) practices. The current study aims to find effective and ineffective GHRM practices used by 
businesses in the context of economic crises in order to improve workforce productivity (WP) during all those crises 
in the health sector of Palestine. A questionnaire-based survey was used, and data were collected from 254 
healthcare professionals working in various public hospitals in Palestine through convenience sampling. Structural 
equation modeling- partial least square (PLS-SEM) was used for data analysis. Results revealed that both power 
outages and global economic recession have significant positive impacts on GHRM. Findings also confirmed that 
GHRM has a positive effect on WP. This study helps the health managers to think about the power outage and 
global economic recession of the public hospitals. Following the various types of crises, the most common human 
resource management strategy was to reduce the number of workers through the downswing, either freeze or reduce 
some training and growth costs. While the performance objectives were formulated harder and more challenging. 
However, the incentive measures and benefits have not been seriously impacted. Whereas the GHRM procedures 
need to be revised, it is also a central responsibility of the company to safeguard the employee's interests in response 
to crises.

1. Introduction 
 
During the era of multiple crises, the role of human resource management in organizations is crucial (Sohail-Rehan 
and Ul-Haq, 2018). The effects of different types of crises on the general economy of Palestine and, in particular 
(Saleh et al., 2021), on the health sector is critical. The healthcare sector faces many obstacles, such as the spread of 
chronic illnesses, high-cost innovations, inadequate service delivery and the accumulation of solid waste in the city, 
which raises environmental pollution (Zaid et al., 2020; Scott, 2014). Development and environmental impacts have 
helped to launch ground-breaking Human Resources Management (HRM) activities that encourage and enhance 
Green Human Resources Management (GHRM), an environmentally sustainable practice (Bon et al., 2018; Zaid et 
al., 2018; Markoulli et al., 2017). In general, GHRM activities are carried out at a moderate level in the Palestinian 
health systems, for a variety of reasons from the point of view of managers (Zaid et al., 2018). The reasons for this 
are lack of awareness and commitment from top management and staff to green practices, implementation costs and 
lack of government facilitation for such practices, and consideration of providing social medical services (Mousa 
and Othman, 2020). 
 
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) confirms that the lack of medicines and medical supplies, and the 
power crisis resulting from the shutdown of the power plant and the effects of a power outage for long hours on 
medical facilities. Due to power outage, adverse effects can be seen on laboratories and blood banking supplies and

1. Introduction  
Over the beyond ten years, drone technology improvement for the cause that the first commercial drone changed into 
released at CES 2010 has created more than one man or woman and establishments to apply drones for a couple of 
features. We are presently dwelling in a time in which drones are being used for meal shipping, the cargo of products, 
and film filming and they may, in all likelihood, comprise more elements of our lives close to destiny. Although drones 
moreover pose a pinnacle-notch venture in terms of protection and prolateness inside the society (for each person and 
organization), and many drone-associated incidents are reported each day. These occasions had been known as the 
reputation of them want to hit upon and disable drones used for malicious intentions and started out up new studies 
and development regions for academia and corporation, with a market that is predicted to approach $2 billion by the 
usage of 2024. Laptop imaginative and prescient is a way of using imagery, both images, and video, to recognize 
devices. Computer imaginative and prescient duties require techniques to collect, store, interpret and apprehend the 
data in the pics. There are numerous strategies for computer imagination and prescience, including image popularity, 
object localization, object identification, semantic segmentation, and segmentation of instances, etcetera, and falls 
below the Architectures of object Detection. Your most effective look as soon as (YOLO) is a technique to object 
detection through the use of co-evolutionary neural networks for item detection. YOLO's key benefit is that it 
facilitates the monitoring of artifacts in real-time. ""YOLO"" pleasant seems in the entire picture once. As a result, the 
call ""you look most effective once. This paper is an observation of the layout and characteristics of YOLO. Moreover, 
this paper is been used to explore the possibility of using AHP analysis to increase the accuracy of objects detection 
that’s been already illustrated for the previous project that published under the same idea of our project.

550","6. Conclusion  
 
In conclusion, it is recognized from the evaluations of different articles that YOLO is the handiest and pleasant 
structure for any form of detection of actual-time objects. YOLO is simple to include, clean to recognize, and strong. 
Because it generalizes properly, it could be used in any app. the rate assessment with different CNNs is likewise 
provided in this study. However, the darknet is one of the important pieces of equipment that helped us to make our 
paintings successful in the detection of drones. This undertaking is on keeps development, and the next steps for us 
are using exclusive types of drones with distinct versions and designs, that is for the cause of increasing our dataset 
and additionally, increase the objects to be diagnosed of our detection system. The choice help tool used in this paper, 
the Analytic Hierarchy method, gives a systematic and flexible framework for analyzing the impact of things, together 
with the historical past, light stage, distance, and altitude. The flexibility of the AHP permits choice-makers to confirm 
the approach to match the particular occasions of a certain state of affairs. The AHP makes it viable to consist of each 
qualitative and quantitative element within the evaluation as well as subjective judgments by the choice-makers.

1. Introduction 
 
With the increasing technology that is getting faster. The information is easily accessible via the internet already 
evidenced by many Indonesian people who use the Internet and 64 percent are already connected to the Internet, the 
number of internet users in Indonesia has reached 175.4 million, from a spike to make social media platforms have been 
like the primary requirement of society, especially in Indonesia, with platform the very much used by the community to 
meet their needs as a source of information. One of the social media platforms that can be used to find information is 
Instagram. The data states that there were 62.23 million active Instagram users in Indonesia in January 2020 as of May 
2020 as many as 69.2 million users out of a total internet access of 175.4 million people, Instagram is one of the most 
popular social media platforms in Indonesia. 
In the era of the industrial revolution 4.0, anyone can influence many people, they can even become a trendsetter, 
which means that everyone has the possibility to be the center of people's attention. This is often referred to as the concept 
microcelebrity, which is a new style of online performance which includes measures to increase popularity, through web 
technologies such as videos, blogs, and social networking sites (Maulana, et al. 2020). 
The phenomenon of social media influencers that is currently booming has a big influence on people's consumption 
patterns. A lifestyle that pays more attention to prestige making people carried away by the current style that is popular 
with social media influencers. The amount of public consumption of products promoted by social media influencers 
greatly affects the growth of the digital economy. This is supported by a level of trust in social media 51 percent in 2018 
(Edelman, 2018). The trust built by social media influencers with their followers causes the consumption of a brand to 
increase. With the increasing level of public trust in social media, more and more brands are entrusting their products to 
be promoted on social media influencers, especially on Instagram. According to research conducted by Sugiharto (2019), 
social media influencers have a significant effect on purchasing decisions. Meanwhile, according to Kurnia's (2020) 
research, product quality also has a significant effect on product purchasing decisions. Therefore, social media influencers

Table 5.6 shows that the R value of 0.910 and R square  (R2)is 0.827. This figure is used to see the magnitude of the 
influence of social media influencers and product quality on purchasing decisions simultaneously. The way to calculate 
R square uses the coefficient of determination (KD) using the following formula: 
  
KD = r2x 100% 
= (0.910) 2 x 100% = 82.7% 
This figure shows the coefficient of determination (KD) of 82.7%. This shows that the influence of the independent 
variables (social media influencers and product quality) on the dependent variable, namely purchasing decisions, is 
82.7%, while the remaining 17.3% is influenced by other factors not examined in this study, such as service quality and 
price factors. 
6. Conclusion  
 
Based on the results of research and discussion that has been stated previously regarding the influence of social media 
influencers and product quality on purchasing decisions in hand & body lotion products Scarlett Whitening, several 
conclusions can be drawn which are expected to provide answers to the problems formulated in this study are as follows: 
a. Based on the results of descriptive analysis, social media influencers in the eyes of the respondents as a whole are in 
the good category. 
b. Based on the results of the descriptive analysis, the overall quality of the product in the eyes of the respondents was 
in the good category. 
c. Based on the results of the descriptive analysis, the purchasing decisions in the eyes of the respondents as a whole are 
in the good category. 
d. Based on the simultaneous hypothesis test (F test),variables social media influencer and product quality 
simultaneously have a significant effect on purchasing decisions on hand & body lotion products  Scarlett Whitening. 
The amount of influence of social media influencers and product quality simultaneously on purchasing decisions is 
82.7% and the remaining 17.3% is influenced by other factors not examined in this study. 
 
Based on the results of partial hypothesis testing (T test),variables social media influencer and product quality 
partially have an influence on purchasing decisions on hand & body lotion products Scarlett Whitening. The variable 
that has the most significant effect is product quality

Abstract 
 
Since the exacerbation of companies’ competitiveness from the 2nd World War until today, there are many historical 
processes that have contributed to the evolution of the company, as well as its methodologies and culture in general. 
This work was carried out in the context of a comprehensive and presentative study of a system approach that was 
created just to improve the preventive maintenance methods in the 1970s. But this approach has evolved according to 
the finalities of the company changing and aiming to be adapted to its changing external environment in terms of 
industrial performance, indeed, according to the evolution of the company’s competitiveness! This is the Total 
Productive Maintenance, in view that according to the literature, we have found that since the appearance of this 
approach in Japan in the 1970s until today, it has known a very evolutionary perspective that we have concretized in 
its different definitions by scientists, academics and researchers from the industrial world! We confirm the progressive 
penetration of the systemic thinking, in fact, the penetration of the system approach and its system analysis tool in the 
company’s cultural structure, to regenerate it and leave the company always tending towards the management model 
of body with holistic behavior and organized according to the finality of optimizing the production systems 
maintenance, productivity, and safety while ensuring a production of irreproachable quality products. Since its 
creation until now, the TPM has known more than 25 definitions and several perspectives! These perspectives have 
changed according to the context of the TPM as an intellectual project that goes beyond the scale or the concept of 
methodology or strategy within the company, for acting on its ideology and anchoring the production system 
sustainability mindset at all levels of the company as a whole. According to Hallioui and Herrou (2020a, 2020b), “the 
challenge of economic performance is becoming more and more heavy on companies in a context of diversified 
constraints imposed by their environment. Furthermore, history proves the permanent and incessant change of the 
company’s competitive environment, putting it in a stifling field of competitiveness, which forces the companies 
around the world to commit to the permanent optimization of their economic performance based on the continuous 
improvement of their production resources”. This is to ensure their sustainability within a changing international 
context! But until today, the Overall Equipment Effectiveness is expressed in terms of availability rate, performance 
rate, and quality rate, there is no parameter emphasizing the sustainability! In addition to this, the TPM deployment 
does not consider the sustainability pillar of the system. Therefore, during the TPM implementation, manufacturers 
forget the major objective and natural need of the company which is its sustainability! That is why we thought of 
broadening the dimension of the TPM, by bringing the sustainability matter reducing the resistance to its 
implementation at the level of the company, which puts in front of today’s companies around world, a Sustainable 
Total Productive Maintenance (STPM) that goes beyond the concept of methodology, to focus on the company 
ideology.

ABSTRACT 
 
An ergonomically designed workstation is recommended for prolonged periods of time. Having an ergonomically 
designed workstation is beneficial for the health of an individual; therefore, this research is for the benefit of college 
students currently studying at home to minimize their risk of Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). Using the results of 
the survey that consisted of Rapid Upper Limb Assessment worksheet (RULA) and Corlett & Bishop Body Map 
worksheet, it was confirmed that the current design of the workstation they use exposed them to risks of having an 
MSD. Prolonged usage of an improperly designed workstation can lead to a risk of the health of an individual. To 
solve this, the researchers used the collected data from the surveys deployed to have a reference on which designs 
have the least level of discomfort to have designed an ergonomic work. In the application, we used the data of our 
survey to come up with an ergonomic design for the chair and table for the preferred use of the students to avoid them 
from the risk of MSDs.

1.  Introduction 
A workstation refers to the computer and other surroundings where the work gets done. According to Onar et al. 
(2016), A workstation is a working area that is designed for specific applications that includes a computer. With 
computer workstations being a part of the work done by humans, it must be compatible, efficient, and well-designed, 
which is catered to provide stable support allowing movement, and comfort. Therefore, good human posture is the 
foundation for good workstation ergonomics as good posture helps to avoid injuries (Asaolu 2014). This study is 
relevant, since the use of poorly designed workstations could lead to Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and injuries. 
MSDs are the most common health complaints in the working population and the advancement in technology is a big 
contributor to these complaints (Levy 2018). Gatchel and Kishino (2011) stated that the association of bodily elements 
with psychological, ergonomic, and occupational factors can be the source of MSDs. A type of MSD experienced by 
users without properly designed workstations is the carpal tunnel syndrome, one of the most common injuries within 
the boundaries of computer work, it is caused by the excessive abduction and extension of muscles in the wrist and 
hand. Thennarasi (2015) found that there is a strong relationship between carpal tunnel syndrome and work-related 
tasks. Furthermore, the research of Vargas et al. (2020), revealed poorly designed workstations were indicated as a 
factor that decreases work efficiency and is a risk factor for the user. In line with the contribution of poorly designed 
workstations, a research by the National Research Council, Division of Behavioral Social Sciences Education, &

6. Conclusion 
To conclude, each of the respondents have their own preference in the time they study, the duration in which they 
study, and the area in which they study. Moreover, the significance of this study was to provide a design that considers 
the user of a workstation to be able to work comfortably for long periods of time, therefore the focus of the design 
was to be able to work for long periods of time without having discomfort and a great risk of exposure to MSDs. Both 
type of chair and duration of study greatly contributes to the discomfort of students while the other factors do not have 
any effect on the students’ discomfort.  The ideal type of chair to be used are lounge chairs to reduce discomfort and 
the duration of study should be up to 6 hours a day. In correlation analysis, seat and table height, and the seating 
posture have a significant relation to the discomfort score. In regression analysis, seating posture, seat width, and 
backrest height significantly affect the discomfort scores.

Abstract  
 
The government pays incredible consideration to the advance of SMEs by giving delicate advance help through state-
owned banks. In its usage, this banks offers delicate advance to SME all through Indonesia to move forward their 
trade. The Indonesian government offers full financing for the Little Medium Undertaking.. To urge this delicate 
credit, SME must yield a proposition that will be assessed for its achievability. The proposition built up will be 
assessed for its achievability by permitting for a few decided benchmarks. The technique utilized by checking on the 
guidelines that must be met by the SME to obtain delicate credit from the government at that point join together these 
criteria/standards with AHP. Subsequently, we produce a framework that can assistance management make the

1. Introduction  
Indonesia is nowadays a growing nation, this can be supposed from a variance of profitable fields have ongoing to 
appear. All peoples are stimulating to generate businesses, be they enterprises that are SME to huge scale. SMEs have 
a substantial role in growing, this can be gathered when the economic disaster drive Indonesia in 1998 where several 
giant corporations deceased broke. Although SMEs themselves are adept to stand up with a let moveable in the face of 
the existing crisis. Founded on data from the Ministry of SMEs, the proportion of the quantity of UMKMs in Indonesia 
in 2017 is almost 60%(Inayatulloh,2020) 
The government arrangements SME of the community through imaginative trade exercises with the assistance of 
delicate advance. An genuine instrument is wanted so that this delicate advance is in assertion with the point by point 
necessities. Decision Support Framework may be a plot built to commitment choice creation and is perfect for 
examination and modeling. DSS  can offer assistance company in creation choices where the information utilized 
determines from MIS. Management Data Framework is constructed to help administrators in carrying out their 
responsibilities, extraordinarily employments associated to choice making, assessing information. The going before 
think about utilized AHP (Explanatory Pecking order Handle) strategy in Bekraf(Inayatulloh,2020), to decide help for 
SME  and Analytical hierarchical processing examination the Obstructions for green source series administration 
employment(Govindan,2014) 
 The decision support system strategy settle issues that have various requirement   or MCDM. MCDM can be utilized 
to back choice creation that incorporates a extraordinary degree of trouble in characterizing the most noteworthy 
alternate  of all accessible options (Akkaya,2013). . The past ponder utilized Promethee to choose Pioneer Winnowing

be used for people with disabilities. The aim of this research is to help people with disabilities use e-
learning. The result of this research is a model of e-learning which is specially built for people with 
disabilities, especially the blind and deaf.

1. Introduction  
Disability, or self-limitation can be physical, cognitive, mental, sensory, emotional, developmental or some combination 
of these. The terms diffable and disability themselves have slightly different meanings. Difabel (different ability) is 
defined as someone who has the ability to carry out different activities compared to the average person, and does not 
necessarily mean ""disabled"" or disabled. Meanwhile, disability is defined as someone who has not been able to 
accommodate the surrounding environment, causing disability. The number of people with deaf and mute disabilities 
is more than 1 million people all over Indonesia (Kasim,2010). 
 
E-Learning that is structured with the aim of using information technology or computers so that it is able to support the 
learning process that can be done remotely by combining the principles in the learning process with information 
technology and can be implemented without having to meet face to face directly between teachers and students 
(Mayes,2007) 
 
In 2010, TELKOM RDC in collaboration with the National Federation for the Welfare of the Deaf Indonesia (FNKTRI) 
carried out further development in the form of an application and portal named i-CHAT (I Can Hear and Talk). The 
application is made in two modes, namely offline mode, where the user must install the program on his computer and 
online mode where the user can run the application by accessing the i-CHAT site at http: //www.i-chat.web.id. The i-
CHAT program is currently divided into 5 main modules, namely the dictionary module, the conditional module finger 
alphabets, number sign module, thematic module, and sentence composing module. i-CHAT can be accessed online by 
visiting the i-CHAT portal athttp://www.i-chat.web.id. However, the application is limited to 5 modules: Dictionary, 
Finger Alphabet, Numbers, Thematic, and Sentence Arrangement. (Kuswari,2011)

Persons with disabilities have the same rights to get learning and education, including using information technology 
that supports the learning process. This model was built specifically to help people with disabilities use e-learning.  
This model was built by paying attention to the limitations of persons with disabilities so that even with the existing 
limitations they can still use e-learning. One part of the model is the existence of a computer algorithm that converts 
teaching materials into materials that people with disabilities can understand

Abstract  
Ballet is a complex art form that consists of precise movements atypical to the human body and 
requires meticulous technique. Students receive only a limited portion of their instructor's attention in a 
classroom setting and private coaching is often financially inaccessible, which results in overlooked 
mistakes. As a result, these momentary errors become habitual and culminate in serious injuries that would 
be prevented with proper body alignment. This research focused on enhancing the current technology in 
instructional programs for ballet by training a teacher model with open-source video data of professional 
dancers. We used a novel Feature Angle Extraction system as a medium to standardize variances among 
different dancer videos. Our pipeline consisted of the pose estimation system OpenPose to identify dancers’ 
joint positions, Dynamic Time Warping to align video frames, Random Forests Classifier to feature select 
characteristics of correct movements, and Decision Tree Classifiers to generate feedback. The outcome of 
this study was a highly accurate application that computes a percent depiction of movement quality and 
returns user-friendly feedback upon the input of a single-view video. 
 
Keywords: Motion analysis, pose estimation, dynamic time warping, random forest classifier, ballet 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Ballet is a complex art form that consists of meticulous movements atypical to the human body and requires precise 
technique and body alignment. Even though human ballet teachers can instruct dancers, their attention is often divided 
between several students. Personalized feedback is rare during regular classes and achieving correct body alignment 
while turning for certain poses (e.g. pirouettes) may be difficult for inexperienced dancers. The repetition of subtle 
mistakes in movements such as these may result in serious injuries. We seek to prevent these in our work by developing 
an accessible, automatic ballet instructor that can supplement in-person guidance. 
 
This software provides personalized feedback using a single-view video of the user, which can be recorded on most 
mobile devices. It uses a previously developed, now optimized, 3-D pose estimation system to recognize the dancer's 
joints over a series of video frames. These joints are processed using a novel angle feature extraction system, which 
derives a pair of angles (front view and side view) from each joint’s x, y, and z coordinates to serve as a comparative 
medium between the student video and the teacher model. The joint angles are standardized with Dynamic Time 
Warping and then analyzed using a newly developed vector-geometry algorithm. An instructor model is trained and 
tested with videos from beginner, pre-professional, and professional (ground truth) ballet dancers. Finally, the 
program's feedback includes the correctness of the user video and possible improvements in English sentences.

603","Also, some mobile devices (which we expect to be the primary tools for recording user input) record at only 30 
frames per second. Although newer models can reach 60 frames per second, this is not to be expected. Thus, there is 
some ambiguity between frames and the angle-difference approach we take can only infer linear movement. 
 
Additionally, the BalletNetTrainer program is currently only able to analyze pirouettes. However, the general pipeline 
can be expanded to accommodate other types of physical activity (other dances, sports, exercise, etc..). Through this 
versatility, the BalletNetTrainer approach seeks to transform available video resources of professionals into digital 
instructors that can help people better perform physical activities. Although this program cannot yet fully replicate the 
experience of personalized, human coaching, it can supplement that coaching or provide effective instruction when it 
is not available. 
 
6. Conclusion  
 
The BalletNetTrainer program is an accessible, automatic ballet instructor that can supplement traditional guidance 
with specific and easily applicable feedback. There are several notable takeaways from this study. Our novel angle-
based approach to pose correction involves a Feature Angle Extraction (FAE) system and the generation of a teacher 
model. The FAE system developed for BalletNetTrainer selects the groups of angles most relevant to the evaluation 
of a dancer’s technique through a Random Forests Classifier. It is observed that the torso, shoulders, hip, and arm 
angles were the quantitative evaluation of the importance of the predictor variables. Those features have been assessed 
in various professional videos to identify a suitable teacher model. Comparison of the user’s data to this model allows 
BalletNetTrainer to provide potential improvements targeting particular features of the user’s pose.  
 
Unlike programs that rely on CNN and feature maps, BalletNetTrainer stores angle data to encode the position and 
orientation of the user. This approach provides higher-quality feedback, which has the potential to reduce injury and 
improve technique in dancers of all skill levels. Furthermore, our comparison-based pipeline can be expanded to 
incorporate physical movements relating to other sports given the needed expert video data.

1. Introduction 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic effect not limited to public health only it has had a significant effect 
on all aspects of people's lifestyle around the globe, as well as a significant impact on various industries. 
The public health crisis changes the day-to-day operation of the businesses, consumer behavior, and accelerated the 
adaption of exiting trends that would normally have taken years to occur in a matter of few months. However, the 
immediate impact of this pandemic can be seen on companies’ revenues as shown in figure 1 the top industries affected 
by COVID-19.

614","Other examples of how COVID-19 was a turning point for some companies such as, in Thailand, phone shopping 
applications download rate went up to 60% within only seven days in March 2020. Also, in the United Kingdom 
online groceries market noticed an increase by more than 25% (UNCAD, 2021). 
 
In Saudi Arabia, e-commerce started for limited number of companies back in 2001. It began to grow by time until 
2005 when e-commerce sales reached about 7 trillion U.S. dollars, since then the government started to motivate 
investors to dive in this industry so it can grow more. Until 2018 Saudi Arabia became on the top ten list in the world 
of countries that grow on e-commerce business to reach up to 80 billion dollars.  
 
In 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic  and Saudi Arabia restrictions, the Saudi government provided a couple of 
shopping and food alternatives such as, publishing more than new 20 applications licensed by Communications and 
Information Technology Commission (CITC). Also, lots of grocery stores focus on their applications to shop from 
home which lead to 
• 
About 200% incensement on sales. 
• 
Ordering rate increased by about 50%. 
• 
The grocery stores promotions increased by about 400%. 
• 
Create more jobs such as delivery. 
 
3. Recommendations, Conclusion and the Way Forward 
Based on our review, we observed that the COVID-19 pandemic had accelerated the digital adoption journey for all 
industries, where we can see some countries like Saudi Arabia has effectively adopted contactless payments method 
where there were over 266 million contactless transactions. When compared to the same timeframe in 2019, this 
reflects a 174 percent rise, banks have quickly moved their physical channels to be online, food delivery apps have 
risen in popularity to the point that the industry is projected to be worth $154.34 billion by 2023, Healthcare suppliers 
have transformed into telehealth, and retailers into contactless shopping and delivery. The crisis brought many new 
challenges - as well as opening new opportunities. Therefore, considering the problems that the world in general faced, 
it is highly recommended the business owners take some actions that will help them to strengthen their business and 
be better prepared for any new crisis in these recommendations: 
 
• 
Develop their digital transformation roadmap before they need it. 
• 
Looking for multiple revenue streams. 
• 
Adopt the new trends in the industry.  
 
The outcome of this review will help the business owners in comparing their businesses against peers in the same 
industry, finding new approaches to defend their market position, and build their competitive advantage.

Abstract  
 
After the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in late December 2019, many supply chains (SCs) and 
industries around the world have been greatly affected by the impacts of the virus. Measures such as closure of 
international airports, seaports, land borders, nationwide lockdown, social distancing, quarantine measures, and work-
from-home have impacted many production firms and consumers around the globe. The overall objective of the 
research is aimed at assessing the impact of the covid-19 lockdowns and social distancing measures on the SC of the 
Sierra Leone Brewery Limited (SLBL) located in Sierra Leone, West Africa. The study gives insights into the 
understanding of SC in relation to the covid-19 pandemic by uncovering key issues of the covid-19 measures to the 
normal operations of the company that provides a baseline for the company in decision making should there be such 
an unforeseen disruption to its SC. The research adopted a case study qualitative research method, administering open-
ended questionnaires to identify the key problems caused by the covid-19 measures. The research identified six (6) 
key problems from the responses of participants and proposes improvement initiatives by the use of the quality 
function deployment (QFD) framework.

1. Introduction  
COVID-19 pandemic has brought a disruption that has impacted every corner of the globe since the outbreak in 
Wuhan, China in late 2019. Disruptions are costly to a firm’s supply chain and hence affects the performance of the 
entity. Pujawan and Bah (2021) described SC disruptions as significant breakdowns in the production process that 
affect end-user activity. This corroborate the ideas of Vanpoucke and Ellis (2019) who suggested that supply chain 
disruptions, and their mitigation, represent a pressing concern for today’s purchasing, supply managers, and the supply 
chain as a whole. The beverage industry is an essential component of Sierra Leone’s economy.  
Global SCs have been disrupted due to the interconnectivity of their activities. Kamara and Pujawan (2020) 
emphasized that the management of SCs has become a significant aspect of global business performance and 
sustainability. The practice of social distancing has become a lifestyle as individuals, governments, communities, and 
industrial firms come to stick with it (Sarkis et al. 2020). A global fall in economic activities by the major production 
countries in the world has resulted in several firms reducing staff capacity and taking other necessary measures to 
suppress increased costs. Therefore, this research has been conducted at a time where companies are faced with various 
challenges in their SC processes during the covid-19 pandemic. The improvement initiatives provided in this paper 
will serve as a baseline for the company’s SC continuous resilience and performance during disruptions.  
 
1.1 Background of the Sierra Leone Brewery Limited 
The Sierra Leone Brewery Limited came into existence on 19th November 1962 with its production and manufacturing 
headquarters located at the Wellington Industrial Estate in the eastern part of Freetown, Sierra Leone. The company 
started producing Heineken lager beer after obtaining permission from Messrs. Heineken Technique and Beer of 
Holland. This product was brief due to increases in production related costs. A major supplier of stocks is IBECOR 
in Holland, approved by Heineken International to supply Krones (Heineken Technical Experts) materials, raw 
materials like malt, sugar, yeast, etc. and spare parts for the new bottling line which is used for producing the products

Abstract  
 
This research attempts to examine the role of supply chain management in enhancing customer satisfaction in the 
banking industry, taking Skye Bank Sierra Leone Limited as case study. Accordingly, the research focused on 
assessing some specific supply chain variables (reliability, responsiveness, cost and quality of products and services, 
and agility), among others, which are judged to influence customer satisfaction in the banking industry. The study 
utilized a mix of quantitative and qualitative data, for which descriptive statistical methods were adopted to analyze 
the data collected. 185 participants being customers of the case institution were targeted for this study via convenient 
sampling, from which 162 customers took part in the research. Findings revealed that, the variables assessed in this 
study seem to have a significant influence on customer satisfaction. Specifically, the reliability and responsiveness 
aspects tend to contribute more to the satisfaction of customers in the case institution than the cost and quality of 
products and services, and agility aspects in this study. The paper proffers some recommendations for enhancing 
customer satisfaction and improve loyalty via use of Quality Function Deployment (House of Quality).

1. Introduction  
The banking industry in Sierra Leone contributes immensely to the labor market and the national gross domestic 
product (GDP). As of 2018, the total assets of the banking sector were Le8.54 Trillion, which is 26.36% of Nominal 
GDP (Bank of Sierra Leone 2020). In relation to the huge profitability the banking industry is showing (Bank of Sierra 
Leone 2020), income from the banking industry is a significant source of economic growth in Sierra Leone. In this 
regard, it is therefore imperative to look for ways of improving the services of the banking industry in Sierra Leone 
that could impact customer satisfaction, since generating and sustaining customer satisfaction is a significant index 
which may strongly determines the success of the banks (Hamidi and Safareeyeh 2019).  
 
In Sierra Leone, the banking industry is still overshadowed by the use of traditional practices characterized by 
inadequate products and services by majority of banks. The size of the countrys’ financial market is relatively small 
and the level of intermediation is quite insignificant (Osei‐Assibey and Bockarie 2013). Even though strides have been 
made by the financial sector to impact economic growth in Sierra Leone, the countrys’ financial market is still 
considered weak which negatively impact resource mobilization and deter economic growth (Kargbo and Adamu 
2012). The problem with inadequate products and services translates to poor service quality and by extension customer 
satisfaction becomes a problem. Many banks are struggling to adjust to the requirements of the changing market 
conditions triggered by rising competition and as such, they are not able to meet the needs and aspirations of their 
customers. This is evident by long queues in banking halls, longer lead times in filling customer requests, series of 
customers complaints, unfriendly staff attitude, inability to access loans and overdrafts, poor ATM services, and 
frequent glitch in the operating system software of banks. In view of the problems highlighted above, however, the 
key problem encountered by some banks, is that they are struggling to maintain their customer base because of 
customers not returning to do business with them as a result of dissatisfaction with the quality of products and services 
they receive. In other words, this research would look at ways on how customer satisfaction can be enhanced and 
improve customer loyalty by evaluating specific variables that impact customer satisfaction in the banking industry in 
Sierra Leone.

637",,"to enhancing customer satisfaction. It is hoped that stakeholders would take advantage of these variables to help solve 
issues relating to customer satisfaction. Accordingly, the variables dubbed as determinants of customer satisfaction 
for this research have been found to be significant in enhancing customer satisfaction according to the results of the 
evaluation made in Table 1 and Table 2. The results seem to indicate that there is some amount of customer satisfaction 
in the case institution as the overall customer satisfaction aspects have a mean score of 3.20, which is above the desired 
average score of 3 from a Likert scale of 1 – 5, and positively relates to the overall mean values of the individual 
determinants aspects of customer satisfaction i.e., reliability (M = 3.90), responsiveness (M = 3.75), agility (M = 3.12), 
and cost and quality of products and services (M = 3.31). It is observed, according to the mean values, that the 
reliability and responsiveness aspects contribute more to the satisfaction of customers in the case institution.  
 
From the foregoing, the results also show that there are dissatisfied customers in the case study institution since the 
overall mean score (M = 3.20) for the satisfaction aspects evaluated is just slightly above the desired average score of 
3 from a Likert scale of 1 – 5, and this can be attributed to the cost and quality of products and services, and agility 
aspects evaluated for this study. In a bid to enhance customer satisfaction and improve loyalty in the case institution, 
the reliability and responsiveness aspects which seem to have higher favorable responses according to the results of 
the mean values and QFD, need to be sustained and the cost and quality of products and services, and agility aspects 
with lower mean and QFD scores, need to be improved on. The cost and quality of products and services, and agility 
aspects that need to be improved on in relation to their low evaluation mean and QFD scores can be seen in Table 1 
and Figure 2 for ease of reference. The improvements or enhancements of customer satisfaction in the case institution 
can only be achieved more seamlessly by working on the targets set for achieving the control factors in the House of 
Quality depicted in Figure 2, otherwise the case institution would remain stagnated. 
 
In all, it is hoped that for future research on this topic or related topics, more variables relevant to supply chain best 
practices would be investigated, and the participants increased by involving more than one case institution in order to 
make this research more meaningful and for better results to be achieved.

Abstract 
This study examined the effect of transport management practices on firms’ performance in Lagos State, Nigeria. 
Purposive sampling was used to select ten food and beverages companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange 
(NSE). Data obtained were analyzed using factor analysis and multiple regression.  
The results of the factor analysis revealed a KMO value of .546; p = 0.000. The total variance explained by the eight 
factors retained when rotated using Varimax = 47.071%. Consequently, the 13 factor loadings were then used as factor 
scores for Multiple Regression. The results of the multiple regression showed that transport management practices 
have a significant effect on the logistics performance of the sampled firms thereby influencing firms’ performance (R2 
= 0.626, F-= 34.971, p = .000). However, only the coefficients of three factors were significant with p = 0.000. These 
factors are freight expenses; shipment tracking; vehicle routing and scheduling with standardized coefficients of 0.737; 
0.196 and 0.173 respectively.  
The findings suggest the need for managers of the sampled firms to develop a dynamic transportation strategy for their 
supply chains that must be responsive, both as to service and cost demands and also implement the Logistics 4.0 in 
order to further drive performance. 
 
Keywords: Transport practices, transport cost, service delivery, logistics, performance. 
 
1. Introduction 
According to Thomas et al., (2014) transportation is a major contributor to the economy and a competitive force in 
business.  Hence, Laird (2012) asserted that transportation is a major part of the supply chain due to its power to add 
value to goods by moving them from their current location to a more advantageous location. Transportation occupied 
one-third to two thirds of the amount in the logistics costs as transportation in manufacturing firms (Bowersox et al., 
2010). Hence, the need for effective and efficient management of the transportation activities becomes inevitable due 
to cost pressures and customer service requirements thereby making firms embrace Transport Management Practices 
(TMP) in order to attain better logistics efficiency, reduce operation cost, and promote service quality of firms.  
 
An inefficient transportation system may lead to firm incurring high cost to deliver product to customer, and this may 
lead to loss for the firm; and the transport system must be able to address the major issues of the mode selection, route 
selection and fleet size because it is the vital force for competition for the firm (Goldsby et al., 2014). Towards this 
end, TMP has been thought of to help in improving logistics performance, thereby influencing the overall firm 
performance as observed by Mukolwe and Wanyoike (2015); Mwangangi (2016); Nuahn (2017). 
Nevertheless, manufacturing firms nowadays operate in an increasingly dynamic business environment (Abdullahi, 
2016) due to increasing complexities of logistics operations driven by customer demand for individualization, high-
cost pressures and improved customer service level.  
 
Nevertheless, the food and beverages subsector of the consumer industry in Nigeria has been a major contributor to 
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country over the years and is highly competitive, with the subsector 
competing on the basis that they can distribute to customers a finished, desirable and quality product than the 
competitors as at when needed. However, Logistics managers are now faced with transportation related problems 
while trying to meet cost and service requirements.

649","routing while REGR factor score 7 was renamed shipment tracking. Freight expenses made the highest significant 
contribution of 73.7% followed by shipment tracking with a contribution of 19.6%, while vehicle routing made the 
least significant contribution of 17.3%’ This implied that, transport management practices reduce freight expenses for 
the firms thereby resulting in lower logistics costs. Also, transport management practices enable shipment tracking in 
real time by providing the ability to view where drivers and shipments are located in real-time. Furthermore, it enables 
users to optimize vehicle routing and scheduling for efficient delivery. Transport management practices also helps the 
firms to plan and manage shipments and determines the cheapest and most efficient carrier/mode using better route 
planning, load optimization, carrier mix and mode selection. Thus, the study found that transport management 
practices have significant effect on the logistics performance of the firms. This finding conforms to Mukolwe and 
Wanyoike (2015) that transport management and the practices impacts positively on operational efficiency. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Empirically, the study indicated that transport management practices have significant effect on logistics performance 
of the selected food and beverages companies. This implied that an increase in firms’ can be influenced by embracing 
transport management practices within the logistics management function. Also, the study tested and confirmed the 
conceptual model built as well as the hypothesis postulated. Thus, the study concluded that transport management 
positively influences firm performance. Also, the study has tested the conceptual model on transport management 
practices and logistics performance. This research notes three key areas in which transport management practices 
influences firms’ logistics performance: are reduced freight expenses, enhanced shipment tracking, and vehicle routing 
and scheduling. Thus indicates the importance of transport management practices in driving firm performance. 
However, based on the finding of the study, it was recommended that managers of the sampled firms should in addition 
to the use of transport management practices develop a dynamic transportation strategy for their supply chains that 
must be responsive, both as to service and cost demands and implement the Logistics 4.0 that goes beyond the use of 
traditional information and communication technology in order to further drive performance.

6. Conclusion  
The model developed from TAM will be easy to apply because the identification of external variables is obtained from 
observations and interviews with SMEs. One of the variables that has a very strong influence on this model is the 
relationship with the SME community. The SME community is a strength for SMEs to work together and collaborate 
to improve the performance of SMEs including in the context of increasing sales through e-marketplaces. Strong 
relationships with fellow SMEs in the community will also reduce worries about transaction risks on the e-
marketplace. 
The limitation of this research is that it has not included cultural variables and the behavior of SME owners where 
according to some studies it has a strong influence on decision making.

1. Introduction  
In a highly competitive environment, the effort of hospitality firms to constantly enhance product and service quality 
is necessary but insufficient to improve their businesses. A key success factor is the quality relationships that a firm can 
maintain with its customers considering that the cost of acquiring new customers is higher than that of retaining existing 
ones (Peppers,1993) 
The greatest problem of the organization  are recalling their customers. Rivalry bargains customers numerous 
substitutes which cause it hard for hotels to keep on their customers. It is problematic for hotels to make solid customer 
base if they equitable offer related services.  E-CRM is one solution  to resolve the problem.(Rigby,2003) the purpose 
of this research is to help hotel businesses retain their customers loyalty. The research method is done by analyzing 
hotel customers and dividing based on several criteria. the result of this research is the E-CRM model for the hotel 
business.

6. Conclusion  
Many factors cause customers to have loyalty using hotel services, therefore organizations must be more serious in 
improving services for customers because the CRM that is built will fail if it is not supported by quality food services, 
friendly employees and others. 
This model was created to help hotel managers identify customers and make existing customers have a high loyalty

Abstract 
 
The century old problem of configuring n queens on a chessboard so that none of them attack one another, 
known as the “n-queens problem”, has been studied intensively by researchers, along with many variants. 
To this day, the problem stands as a prominent example for backtracking search methods. Its demonstration 
of constraint satisfaction, as well as systematic and heuristic search methods, highlights its utility in fields 
such as artificial intelligence (AI) and program development.  This paper focuses on a contemporary variant, 
the “mod 2 n-queens problem”, recently proposed by Brown and Ladha. This paper uses graph theory to 
solve some of the open problems Brown and Ladha posed. 
 
Keywords 
Chess, modulo n-queens, domination, independence, queen graph. 
 
1. Introduction  
The Mod 2 n-Queens Game 
The n-queens problem is a challenge to place n queens on a n × n chessboard so that none of these queens attack one 
another. Noon describes this problem as a two-player game, where players successively place queens on a n × n board 
so that none attack each other (Noon 2002). The “mod 2 n-queens game”, rooted in the ideas of the n-queens game, 
was introduced by Brown and Ladha (Brown and Ladha 2019): on a n × n board, a queen can only be placed on a 
square if there are an even number of queens attacking that square, and a queen cannot be placed on a square if there 
are an odd number of queens attacking the square. These squares are respectively defined as open and closed squares. 
With a square taking on a value of the number of queens attacking it, these rules translate mathematically in terms of 
modulo 2: any square with an even integer value would be congruent to 0 mod 2, and any with an odd integer value 
would be congruent to 1 mod 2. In a mod 2 n-queens game, two players take turns placing queens, either cooperatively 
to fill the board, or competitively until queens can no longer be placed.  
To briefly compare the n-queens game to the mod 2 n-queens game, we see that a maximum of n queens can be placed 
in the n-queens game on a n × n board when n = 1 or n ≥ 4, whereas a total of n2 queens can be placed in the mod 2 n-
queens game on a n × n board for all positive odd integers n. Figure 1 compares the squares that are left open after a 
placement of five queens on a 5 × 5 board in the n-queens game and the mod 2 n-queens game. To generalize, more 
squares are opened for the placement of queens in the mod 2 n-queens game, and the bound on the maximum number 
of queens that can be placed is thus increased.  
In addition, the order of the placement of queens is relevant to the mod 2 n-queens game, but not to the n-queens 
game. This logic stands as the parity of the board changes with every queen placed. These slight, but notable 
differences between the two games poses many more questions and ideas for exploration in the mod 2 n-queens game. 
There are several of which Brown and Ladha call game states encompassed within the mod 2 n-queens game for an 
arrangement of queens on a n × n board. Rather than developing strategies to win the mod 2 n-queens game, this paper 
focuses on these game states which we treat as problems within the mod 2 n-queens game. Specifically, we explore 
complete and locked boards for a n × n board. Configurations found in these game states can provide a basis for future 
studies that hope to define a winning strategy in the mod 2 n-queens game.

671","number of a 3 × 3 board would be one; one queen is placed in the center of the board to dominate all squares (vertices).  
 
Particularly for the mod 2 n-queens game, it becomes much harder to find domination numbers in graphs with 
numerous vertices due to the additional rules of the game. Nevertheless, we notice that the domination problem in the 
mod 2 n-queens game is similar to the queen’s domination problem earlier discussed in this paper, as the key idea 
summarizes to finding domination numbers and sets within graphs. Keeping in mind the NP-completeness of the 
queen’s domination problem, it is reasonable to assume that it will be notably difficult to find domination numbers 
and sets for the mod 2 n-queens problem, especially for boards of larger sizes. However difficult, we cannot claim this 
problem to be impossible to solve, so it remains an open question for future research.  
 
Even though we cannot disprove Brown and Ladha’s stated upper bounds for all boards, we can disprove the 2n – 1 
queens upper bound for the specific 5 × 5 board.  
 
Proposition 3. For a 5 × 5 board, there exists a placement of 2n – 3 queens which can be achieved through legal 
gameplay and locks the board.  
 
Proof. Refer to figure 11.  
 
 
 
Figure 11: Left: Seven queens placed on a 5 × 5 board, locking the board. Right: Sequence of legal moves to place 
seven queens on a 5 × 5 board. 
 
The configuration of queens in the 5 × 5 board does not have any symmetry or notable patterns, so applying the same 
configuration to larger boards is not practical. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In summary, distinct and detailed proofs were outlined in this paper to answer two of the open problems posed in 
Brown and Ladha’s original exploration of the mod 2 n-queens game. Using the concepts of queen graphs, domination, 
and independence, this paper has taken a unique approach to analyzing the mod 2 n-queens problem. Such an approach 
may be applied in future studies of similar games or problems that are concerned with constraint satisfaction.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this project was to better manage European travel plans by limiting the time to 28.8 hours 
and cost to $500 used in transportation while attending as many conferences as possible. The input variables 
used were the intracity time and expense; the response variables were the total time and expense. Design 
constraints were implemented, ensuring that the model was practical while defining the project scope. Only 
the fastest route, clockwise & counterclockwise, were studied. There are 5 variables (5 cities) and each 
segment has 2 choices: flight or train. Based on research, taking a train would better when travelling 
<500km while taking a flight is preferred when travelling >1,000km (both are possible choices when the 
distance is in between). Based on the costs & durations, only the Paris-Munich route is debatable on which 
transportation to use. The predictive DOE model (based on multiple regression model that was built on 
mean time & expense) shows that Paris-Munich by train is more desirable than flight. The robust design: 
Monte Carlo simulation shows that there is an 8% risk of not meeting the $500 budget. By raising the 
importance of time, the new optimal route can meet time & expense requirements.

Abstract 
 
Traditional Six Sigma curriculums including DMAIC, DFSS, DFR, Lean are not developed specifically and 
effectively for today’s AI Data Science fields. This project will demonstrate an innovative Six Sigma training 
curriculum for Data Scientists. There are several objectives in this modern Six Sigma training curriculum: (1) adopt 
modern Text Mining and Data Mining techniques on Root Cause and Problem Solving Analyses such as DFMECA, 
C&E, QFD, SIPOC, VSM, (2) integrate various JMP statistical platforms holistically to analyze pattern recognition 
and discover the insights, (3) enhance predictive modeling capability through Neural, Partition, Principal Component 
algorithms, (4) utilize modern Quality and Process platforms such as Goal Plot, Model-Driven Multivariate SPC, 
Process History Process and Screening to enhance production quality control, (5) map these modern JMP Platforms 
into the Six Sigma DMAIC/DFSS/Lean framework for facilitating the Six Sigma Project execution, and (6) integrate 
database through Query Builder to monitor the production status in real-time. This curriculum is not just designed for 
a Data Scientist but is also powerful for those working in process, quality, reliability, supply chin, business, statistics, 
and marketing fields who want to become a reliable decision maker and true project leader. This Six Sigma DMAIC 
for Data Scientist Approach can be commonly applied to other Quality Engineering, Project Management and 
Business Excellence methodology such as DFSS, DFR, Lean, 8D, PMP.

1. Introduction 
Traditional Six Sigma methodology and Interdisciplinary “STEM” (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) or 
“STEAM” (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) are popular in School Education is a term used to group 
together these academic disciplines Colwell (2016). 
 
1.1 Six Sigma DMAIC 
DMAIC is the problem-solving approach that drives Lean Six Sigma. It’s a five-phase method—Define, Measure, 
Analyze, Improve and Control—for improving existing process problems with unknown causes. DMAIC is based on 
the Scientific Method. DMAIC is a data-driven quality strategy used to improve processes. The letters in the acronym 
represent the five phases that make up the process, including the tools to use to complete those phases. It is an integral 
part of a Six Sigma initiative, but in general can be implemented as a standalone quality improvement procedure or as 
part of other process improvement initiatives such as lean. 
 
1.2 STEM Methodology 
This STEM term is typically used when addressing education policy and curriculum choices in schools to improve 
competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national 
security concerns and immigration policy. The acronym came into common use shortly after an interagency meeting

Traditional Six Sigma DMAIC and Interdisciplinary STEAMS methods can help develop Data Scientist on leadership 
and team building.  JMP 16 platforms are mapped to DMAIC Phases to help execute Six Sigma Projects in Data 
Science fields. Database Management, Applied Engineering Statistics, Data Mining and Text Mining are all critical

Abstract  
 
Drug counterfeits have been a severe international issue for almost two decades, and the latest statistics 
show that fake medications will continue to penetrate legitimate pharmaceutical supply chains to fulfill the 
desperate need of different segments of patients. Therefore, identifying the issues faced by the 
pharmaceutical supply chain is essential to understand better and combat the drug counterfeited issues, 
which require technological implementation and their applications in various phases of the pharmaceutical 
supply chain to gain better visibility and ensure safety. In this regard, a review has been conducted to fulfill 
the following objectives: 
(i)    Review the application of traceability technologies in various pharmaceutical supply chain phases to  
        detect and solve counterfeit issues. 
(ii)   Analyze the various barriers affecting establishing a safe pharmaceutical supply chain and the critical 
        success factors to overcome those barriers.  
(iii)  Develop a conceptual framework for showing the influence of technologies and success factors on  
        overcoming the various barriers in different phases of the pharmaceutical supply chain. 
 
Recent statistics show that counterfeit drugs will continue to penetrate the legitimate pharmaceutical supply 
chains and target more significant patient segments. Furthermore, smugglers and counterfeiters will also 
continue to target all phases of the pharmaceutical supply chain. This study developed a conceptual 
framework for achieving a safe PSC by demonstrating the influence of traceability technologies and success 
factors on overcoming the various barriers in different phases of the PSC. The critical finding of this review 
was that the traceability technologies and the critical success factors have a significant influence on 
overcoming the barriers in establishing a safe PSC.

Abstract  
 
Manufacturing companies are increasingly adopting digital solutions to monitor and manage production systems. By 
adopting digital solutions, it has become possible for manufacturing companies to collect huge volumes of widely 
varying production system data. Alongside this, significant advances in recent years in machine learning and artificial 
intelligence fields have opened up opportunities to develop data-driven approaches for analyzing the huge emerging 
volumes of data, deriving insights, and using those insights to improve shop floor productivity. One way to increase 
shop floor productivity is to strive to achieve an even flow within production systems. However, even system flows 
may be disturbed by throughput bottlenecks. Throughput bottlenecks are a set of machines that constrain the system 
throughput. Quick and correct identification of throughput bottlenecks will help practitioners plan appropriate 
eliminating actions. Existing academic research efforts to investigate throughput bottlenecks have largely adopted 
analytical approaches (based on building explicit recursive equations) or discrete-event simulation-model-based ones. 
These approaches are better suited for static analysis and more useful for early configurations of the production 
systems. On the other hand, now that companies are collecting huge volumes of digital data, this data can be analyzed 
directly by developing data-driven approaches. This allows the derivation of insights into throughput bottlenecks in 
production systems. This doctoral thesis constructs a series of data-driven approaches to analyze throughput 
bottlenecks. Firstly, a data-driven approach is proposed to identify historical throughput bottlenecks in a production 
system. But merely identifying bottlenecks is not enough if informed actions are to be taken. Secondly, a data-driven 
approach is proposed for diagnosing historical throughput bottlenecks. Specifically, a diagnosis is made based on a 
maintenance perspective. Combined with identification and diagnosis, practitioners may then plan and execute 
different corrective actions. However, when such corrective actions are applied, the dynamics of the production system 
change. That means that bottlenecks will not act as bottlenecks in the future. Thirdly, to thus predict how the system 
dynamics will change (and thereby to predict future throughput bottlenecks), a data-driven approach is proposed to 
predict future throughput bottlenecks in a production system. Fourthly, to help practitioners plan for proactive actions 
on the predicted throughput bottlenecks, a further data-driven approach is proposed; one which prescribes actions to 
combat the bottlenecks. The different data-driven approaches proposed in this thesis have been tested using production 
system data sets extracted from different real-world production systems. The insights obtained from applying these 
approaches may help practitioners to better understand the dynamics of throughput bottlenecks and plan for specific 
actions to eliminate them. Such elimination helps achieve an even flow in production systems, thus increasing 
productivity. The research outcomes of this thesis were implemented in the real world. Two automotive manufacturing 
companies (one in Sweden and one in Germany) have implemented a datadriven approach to detect historical 
throughput bottlenecks. A US-based manufacturing analytics software provider has implemented the data-driven 
approach to detect historical bottlenecks into their package. They provide it directly to their different customers who 
are using their software.

Abstract 
 
The use of chemical process simulators such as Aspen Plus for pharmaceutical applications has received relatively 
little attention. This is due, in part, to the specialized raw materials, products and unit operations that are involved in 
the processes. This paper illustrates that the Aspen Plus simulation system has many of the functional capabilities that 
make it an attractive tool for simulating pharmaceutical processes. These features include solids handling capabilities, 
batch processing, drying, process optimization including data reconciliation and parameter estimation, and finally cost 
estimation including capital and operating costs. These features are demonstrated using a process to manufacture the 
common over-the-counter pharmaceutical commonly referred to by its trade name, aspirin. Aspirin also known as 
ASA or acetylsalicylic acid is one of the oldest pharmaceuticals in wide spread use today and it is relatively simple to 
manufacture. However, the simulation of the process using traditional chemical process simulators is not 
straightforward and exhibit several difficulties involved in solids handling and batch processing. The synthesis of 
ASA is based on the acetylation of salicylic acid with acetic anhydride: 
 
C7H6O3 + C4H6O3 → C9H8O4 + CH3COOH 
salicylic acid + acetic anhydride → acetylsalicylic acid + acetic acid 
 
The reactants (salicylic acid and acetic anhydride) are mixed together with a small amount of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) 
acting as a catalyst. The mixture is then heated to about 50 °C to increase the reaction kinetics. The liquid mixture of 
unreacted salicylic acid and acetic anhydride along with acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid products are then fed into 
a crystallizer operated about 3 °C. The objective of the crystallizer is to precipitate dissolved ASA into solid ASA by 
cooling the solution below the solubility limit. A hydro-cyclone is then employed to separate the solid ASA from the 
solid-liquid stream by spinning the mixture at high velocity. The cyclone separates the solid ASA from the solid-liquid 
stream while allowing about 15 % of the supernatant liquid to remain with the solid stream. The solid ASA plus 
supernatant stream are finally dried to ~ 17 wt.% moisture (dry basis) which is typical in ASA dryers.  
 
Aspen Plus was used to simulate a process designed to produce 145 kg/h of ASA. Based on this case study it was 
found that this process was able to convert about 78 wt.% of the reactants to ASA product at a production cost of 
approximately $3/kg. Based on this preliminary feasible process, process improvements in the form of optimization 
and process control were undertaken including studying the effect of the reactor temperature and recycle split fraction 
on the process operation and economics. Heat exchanger network synthesis and the production rate were also 
investigated.

Abstract 
 
Medical device procurement is a complex process that involves the selection of the product and its supplier. Hospital 
management tends to make medical device purchasing decisions by predominantly relying on healthcare 
professionals’ experiences and observational trials on the devices. This study proposes a decision support model to 
purchase medical devices and compares the findings from different approaches. The study uses TOPSIS and fuzzy-
TOPSIS methods to evaluate six mechanical ventilators under eight criteria. The results revealed that TOPSIS and 
fuzzy-TOPSIS approaches ranked alternatives in the same order at each scenario, except the fourth and fifth 
alternatives being in different ranking order. This study, once again, highlights the value of MCDM methods in rational 
decision making in purchasing medical devices. The study suggests that integrating fuzzy logic, gathering a team of 
experts and determining multiple scenarios have value in supporting decision-making. 
 
Keywords 
Decision-making, Medical devices, TOPSIS and fuzzy-TOPSIS.  
 
1. Introduction 
Medical device procurement is a complex process requiring reliable analysis techniques to make decisions (Keller, 
2019). As part of the procurement process, hospital management determines the most suitable device and supplier 
among alternatives (Ahmadi, Pishvaee and Torabi, 2018). At this point, hospital management tends to make medical 
device purchasing decisions by predominantly relying on healthcare professionals’ experiences or observational trials 
on the devices (Branson and Johannigman, 2004; Thille et al., 2010). 
 
Several researchers and practitioners proposed approaches to support decision-making in evaluating medical devices. 
Chatburn and Primiano (2001) offered a decision analysis tool to assess mechanical ventilators. Some suggested 
ranking suppliers by using a score from 0 (no match) to 4 (very strong match) under multiple criteria (Team Consiliso, 
2018). While the scoring mechanism might also support decision-making, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) 
methods, built on mathematical models, would provide more solid suggestions. MCDM methods propose an ideal 
solution to complex decision-making problems. For instance, Ivlev, Vacek and Kneppo (2015) used Analytical 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) to select an MRI system, Tolga, Parlak and Castillo (2020) used fuzzy TODIM to evaluate 
medical imaging devices, and Sloane et al. (2003) used AHP to select a neonatal mechanical ventilator. 
 
MCDM methods have already been used to support clinical and non-clinical decision-making (Marsh et al., 2017). 
However, the need for using MCDM has been boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the pandemic, decision-
makers have been forced to reach rapid decisions under conflicting criteria in a fuzzy environment. For instance, the 
need for mechanical ventilators increased significantly, and hospital management, in turn, had to deal with 
procurement in a short time. This study uses an MCDM method to support rational decision-making in purchasing 
mechanical ventilators under fuzzy and non-fuzzy environments. The study has two objectives: (1) to propose a 
decision support model to purchase medical devices and (2) compare the findings from different approaches. 
 
2. Methods 
This study uses the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and fuzzy TOPSIS 
method under two different scenarios (i.e., equally-weighted criteria and different weights).

710","weight of each criterion. Here, the team might assign weights to each criterion based on their expert judgment or use 
a technique. Next, the team applies the rest of the TOPSIS and fuzzy-TOPSIS steps to evaluate alternatives. If 
alternatives have absolute values for each criterion, the team might only use TOPSIS. After obtaining results, the 
decision-making team compares the findings and builds a consensus on selecting the alternative. 
 
4. Conclusion  
The need for quick and rational decision-making has been boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a need 
increased the potential value of MCDM methods in healthcare. This study provided a case study for applying TOPSIS 
and fuzzy-TOPSIS methods in purchasing mechanical ventilators and compared the findings from these two 
approaches. The results showed that “M5” is the ideal alternative under the given two scenarios. As M5 was ranked 
first in both scenarios, this represents its dominance among other alternatives.  
 
This study proposed a decision-making approach to overcome the limitations of the MCDM methods. MCDM 
methods have been used to select, classify or prioritize alternatives. However, their use might not always be reliable. 
The use of different MCDM methods might lead to different rankings on alternatives. In turn, this would affect the 
decisions made, especially in prioritizing alternatives. The study suggests that integrating fuzzy logic, gathering a 
team of experts and determining multiple scenarios could improve the outputs from the MCDM methods. 
 
In conclusion, this study provides a step-by-step guide on applying the proposed approach for rational decision-
making. Decision-makers can use the proposed approach in different settings to manage COVID-19 pandemic. Future 
studies can be conducted by involving multiple subject matter experts actually to evaluate the mechanical ventilators. 
MCDM methods can also be beneficial to decide which vaccination product to purchase for the national immunization 
program and enforce COVID-19 restrictions.

Abstract 
 
The transition to advanced data analysis systems that rely on Industry 4.0 approaches is driving energy management 
practices across all industrial sectors, creating more energy efficient and sustainable production systems. Hence, by 
implementing energy monitoring and control systems based on these principles, it is possible to identify potential 
energy improvement opportunities at all organizational levels and to analyze any variation in the energy behavior of 
manufacturing processes using energy performance indicators. With this in mind, this article proposes an energy 
dashboard interface that integrates various energy performance indicators and statistical control methods, to monitor, 
control, and evaluate electricity consumption in sawmill manufacturing processes. Through a case study and synthetic 
datasets, the electricity consumption of the main manufacturing processes of a Canadian sawmill was evaluated using 
this interactive interface. With this energy dashboard, it was possible to develop a more fluid and intuitive decision-
making process for all organizational levels, evaluate energy costs, establish relationships between production outputs 
and energy consumed, map energy savings, make energy predictions, and set energy targets for future improvements. 
This is a practical tool that shows in detail the operational energy profile of an organization.

1. Introduction 
Over the last few years, the fight against global warming, mainly caused by the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, 
has grown in importance among governments and organizations around the world. In this global emergency, according 
to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] (2014), a more efficient use of energy is one of the key 
factors for mitigating global warming. In this context, the industrial sector plays a highly important role since it 
represents between 25% and 50% of the world's final energy consumption (Thollander et al., 2020). Fortunately, 
industry 4.0 foundations lie in digital transformation and the creation of more intelligent and interconnected production 
systems (Müller et al., 2019). Currently, these are an avenue that is not only allowing companies to be more efficient 
and agile in their manufacturing planning processes, but it is also allowing them to have better energy control systems, 
focused on drawing the real picture of their energy consumption profiles (Shrouf et al., 2014). Therefore, the energy 
management (EM) approaches and the concepts and technologies that are driving the fourth industrial revolution, such 
as the use of smarter energy meters, engineering analysis methods and control tools, enable manufacturing plants to 
improve their energy efficiency and reduce their CO2 emissions (Campo et al., 2018; Shrouf et al., 2014).  
 
From this perspective, in the forestry sector, industry 4.0 has been approached in a heterogeneous way since, in the 
last decades, sensor and remote sensing technologies have been discussed, investigated, and developed more deeply 
than any other 4.0 dimension in this industry (Müller et al., 2019). Consequently, advanced data analysis to facilitate 
decision-making appears to be an area with little progress in this sector, which makes it difficult to interpret energy 
consumption patterns and implement efficient EM practices. Regarding the energy profile of this sector, the energy 
trend around the world has changed since biomass and electricity have been predominant sources of energy in recent 
years. Hence, considering that the development of new technologies based on bioenergy has been growing 
progressively (e.g. boilers, kiln drying, cogeneration systems, etc.), the forest products sector must now focus its

5. Conclusion 
Industry 4.0 approaches relying on intelligent and advanced data analytics environments are driving EM practices 
across all manufacturing sectors. A better understanding of the energy behavior in industrial operations is a key success 
factor to have energy efficient and sustainable production systems. Therefore, energy control systems are important 
to identify potential energy efficiency improvements and unexpected changes in energy performance that can be 
quantitatively analyzed at all organizational levels with EnPIs and statistical control tools. From this perspective, the 
work carried out in this article focused on developing an energy dashboard interface to analyze, with synthetic data 
sets, the electricity consumption patterns of the main manufacturing processes of a Canadian sawmill, through various 
integrated EnPIs and statistical control methods. The results obtained after applying this energy dashboard interface 
to the case study of the Canadian sawmill revealed that the operational controls and energy strategies to be deployed 
at all organizational levels will depend entirely on the type of information that can be accessed. Indeed, when 
numerical information systems feed the energy dashboard interface, it is possible to monitor and control electricity 
consumption patterns, identify excessive variations in energy use, detect anomalies, develop better decision-making, 
map processes energy savings, establish relationships between production outputs and consumed electricity, make 
predictions, and define energy targets for future improvements. However, when only the electricity bill is used, the 
analysis possibilities become limited and only rely on the analysis of simple and approximate EnPIs, which makes it 
difficult to understand the true nature of energy problems. Ultimately, the energy dashboard interface is an operational 
guide that supports decision-making with dynamic graphics and visualizations that make it easier to interact with 
information. However, only through deductive reasoning, knowledge of processes, and field experience will it be 
possible to draw effective conclusions for operational energy improvements. This energy interface can also be easily 
adapted and applied to other industrial sectors as long as they have the necessary information to exploit it. The 
application of this tool should continue to be validated in more sawmills and case studies to further improve its 
interface. In future research, other types of energy sources could be added to the interface to provide a complete picture 
of a sawmill’s energy profile. It would also be pertinent to fully integrate the interface with the information systems 
to automate data processing and be easily shared through cloud systems at all organizational levels.

Abstract  
 
Along with the development of the era of the impact of the higher level of competition, the company is 
required to improve its performance in order to win the competition. Various methods are used to help 
companies improve their performance. One way is to create a framework that is a reference for companies 
to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their business processes. Some frameworks have been 
designed to help companies, especially SMEs improve their performance, but some frameworks have 
limitations. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the SME Framework with information system 
perspective by analyzing the literature on SME Framework. by knowing the limitations of the existing 
framework it will be able to design a new framework that is broader in scope. The research method was 
carried out by analyzing the study of the SME framework from 2001 to 2019. This research has found 49 
articles that will be evaluated for their strengths and limitations.

1. Introduction  
SMEs is an object of great interest to researchers and academics with a variety of topics related to SMEs because SMEs 
are one of the economic pillars of a nation.  The development of information technology especially the internet is a 
reason for people who care about SMEs by designing a framework. With the hope that the designed framework can 
become a consideration for SMEs in applying information technology to support the company's business process [4]. 
Designing a framework for SMEs is also done by using the approach of commerce technology. This framework is 
designed to help SMEs use information technology to sell their goods or services. This framework also discusses the 
supporting infrastructure needed so that SMEs can adopt the technology to increase their sales.[22] 
Some researchers are trying to help SMEs by designing frameworks to market the products and services they 
produce using social media. the emarketing framework designed for SMEs is intended so that SMEs can utilize social 
media as a marketing tool for their products because SMEs like most people often interact with social media

6. Conclusion  
Based on a review of some literature, it can be concluded several things: 
1. Research that relates to the SME framework has a significant increase, especially in 2019. This condition 
shows that when more researchers have a concern for the development of SMEs. 
2. Based on the identification and analysis of information system components, most of the research on the SME 
framework focuses on improving the process while the people component which is the most important part 
of the information system is only explained in a small part of the research. 
3. Future research is expected to design the SME framework emphasizing 4 components of the information 
system because by maintaining the balance of these components, the SME framework will be more 
comprehensive

Abstract 
 
This research studied the preferences and opinions of the University of Jeddah students towards electronic exams, also 
reviewed the statistical differences in opinions towards electronic exams between students according to the factors of 
the study, gender, major, GPA, and educational level. The method of the research is the descriptive-analytical method. 
This study focuses on many aspects and classifications that would measure the ability to adopt electronic exams 
instead of paper exams. The sample consists of (1084) students at the University of Jeddah. The sample was selected 
from different faculties majoring in humanities and sciences. The researchers used an electronic questionnaire seeking 
students’ opinions towards electronic exams to collect the data analyzed using SPSS software. The results indicated 
that the preferences of the University of Jeddah students towards electronic exams were positive. There are no 
significant statistical differences in preferences and opinions towards electronic exams among students according to 
gender, major, GPA, and educational level. Eventually, the researchers presented some recommendations that 
encourage adopting electronic exams and keeping up with a continuous improvement in the educational process.

(their preference for electronic exams) for the sample members in the study tool. These differences between each of 
the first year in the specialization and the second year in the specialization and the third year in the specialization, 
and the fourth year in the specialization. The researchers found that the difference is valid for the second year of 
specialization. 
 
 8. Discussions and Recommendations  
The study claim was that electronic exams encourage help to alleviate university student’s effort and easy handling. 
The study consisted of a random sample of 1084 individuals. The 1084 students who have taken the two exams: 
paper and electronic ones have answered the survey to determine how they prefer electronic exams. Furthermore, 
students prefer electronic exams since they are more accessible and more time efficient. Considering the findings of 
this study, some functional implications and recommendations are presented here. 
- 
Develop the infrastructure and technology that are suitable for electronic exams to generalize on all courses.  
- 
Recommend the circulation of electronic exams to replace paper exams.  
- 
Enhance security and networking to securely complete exams that used to be an issue and overcome this struggle 
in the future. 
- 
Provide suitable timing to answer the questions, considering the nature of differences in courses. 
- 
Standardize the level of all exam question forms to achieve equality among students. 
- 
Diversifying questions in electronic exams, including MCQ, true and false, and essay questions to cover the 
various cognitive aspects of the student. 
 
9. Conclusion and Future Research  
9.1 Conclusion 
The findings of this study revealed the need for improvement in the implementation of the assessment mechanism 
regarding exam computerization. This improvement should include the planning and application of practical programs 
for students and instructors’ involvement. The current situation demands administrators, faculty members, and the 
University of Jeddah eLearning center to take the initial step to involve students through the educational process and 
continuous improvement in the learning methods. We observed that most participants tend to prefer taking electronic 
exams instead of paper ones during our journey. It may be wise to first check into the interest of knowing the students’ 
preferences and opinions toward electronic exams through electronic surveys to obtain outcomes that form a clear 
strategy to build an appropriate infrastructure of electronic exams application. Adopting electronic exams is assumed 
to have a better exam evaluation, students’ comfortability, and environmental sustainability. 
 
9.2 Recommendation for Future Research 
The findings of this study revealed the need for answers to many questions related to University of Jeddah students’ 
preferences toward electronic exams. These answers, along with the present study’s findings and the previous research, 
could provide the basis for strong and effective student involvement in higher education. To achieve these answers, 
the following further research is recommended:  
1. A study that investigates the preference of faculty members at the University of Jeddah towards electronic 
exams. 
2. Investigations into the university’s students and professors to which the electronic examination system will 
be applied in the future. 
3. A study to examine the differences in students’ academic achievement between electronic and paper exams.

Abstract 
 
Electronic companies, which use conflict minerals to manufacture products, experience increasing operational burdens 
on 3TG traceability and compliance. Identifying strategies to hit 75% supplier responses, lessening manual processes, 
reducing high-risk and non-compliant smelters in the supply chain, could improve the supplier due diligence process. 
Data collection and analytical review were used to identify helpful strategies and impacts. Surveys and training to 
suppliers were conducted as well to gather best practices and help them to comply. Lastly, a knowledge-based system 
development was proposed. Overall, this revealed that focusing on top spend and a smaller number of suppliers and 
working with other companies to identify strategies and develop a conflict-free supply chain would be a great 
approach. Interestingly, it was also found that active smelters are now proactively engaging with the RMI audit 
protocols and, suppliers (both RMI and non-RMI members), are now getting aggressive to have high-risk smelters be 
removed from their supply chain. Design of a conflict minerals automated system has been started as well to reduce 
manual process that contributes to low supplier response rate and inaccurate conflict minerals data. Future tests and 
study to identify and verify efficiency results to end-users is recommended in this research.

 1. Introduction 
 
The rate of transformation and development in the electronics and technology industry can be surprising, especially 
over the past few decades. These companies need to be flexible and quick to last and they must be able to overcome 
both current and evolving challenges in the market to excel. Some of the challenges they face are decrease functional 
margins where they must constantly become more cost-effective to remain profitable. They must have a robust quality 
and traceability system that directly affects contract reserve and after-production service hours, short product lifecycles 
wherein consumers have a rapid change in their sense of taste and likings, ambiguous demands, evolving protocols 
and standards that force companies to account more and more for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in decisions, 
and lastly having complex global supply chain where companies are having to conjure internal and external assets 
while staying within international standards. Moreover, issues such as traceability and compliance are operational 
challenges that are nowadays increasing. It is not rare for components and sub-components to reach three or more 
continents before getting into the end-consumer. 
 
The company where the author belongs, which is one of the US-based leading electronic and technology producers in 
the world, is no exemption from the above-mentioned issues and challenges. In line with having a complex global 
supply chain, they must assure that the products they sell to the global market are of the utmost quality. To assure 
quality, our processes must meet a range of statutory requirements and some international standard, one of which is 
compliance. The company has two compliance departments, REACH/RoHS and conflict minerals. This paper will 
concentrate more on the conflict minerals side. Conflict minerals compliance department exercises due diligence on 
the company’s supply chains for tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (3TG). They must ensure that their customers receive 
DRC conflict-free products where unlawful human rights violations occur (Islam et al. 2017).

753","5. Conclusion 
 
This study aimed to create improvements in the present Conflict Minerals due diligence processes. Firstly, the 
comparison of the conflict minerals supplier response rate trend from 2015-2020 shows that KPIs implemented per 
year contributed to the significant increase in response rate. Though the response rate trend increases per year, it was 
still not enough for the company to hit the target of 75% response rate. This resulted to problem identification which 
is manual processes taking place in the department which lead to the proposal of an automated system. Secondly, 
looking at the form SD of some US public companies were an effective means to identify due diligence strategies and 
identify and manage risks throughout the entire mineral supply chain. Companies had exercised a due diligence on 
the smelter or refiners, and they had also focused their outreach on smaller number of suppliers. This research is 
purposely limited by research framework. Information gathered are publicly available. Working together with other 
major manufacturers to develop conflict-free supply chains would be a great approach. Additionally, the author 
analyzed whether RMI member suppliers have a better supplier due diligence process than non-RMI member suppliers 
by conducting survey and t-test analysis. It was found that non-RMI members do not have a less comprehensive 
supplier due diligence process than suppliers who are RMI members. This means that any company could do its part 
of reducing high-risk smelters in their supply chain by having corrective actions for these bad smelters and directly 
contacting its suppliers and smelters. Data validation and development of corrective action plan to mitigate risks in 
supply chain will help improve due diligence process and transparency. It will also help downstream companies to 
influence upstream companies. In addition, this study proposes that companies must establish not only a management 
system to support supply chain due diligence related to 3TG but also an automated system designed for conflict 
minerals. This led to the development of conflict minerals knowledge-based system (KBS) by the author. The 
implementation of the KBS, as the company believes, would be significant for them to hit its target response rate of 
75% within this year. This methodology, however, is limited only to system requirements gathering until prototyping. 
The KBS methodology was developed starting when the author analyzed the case background of the project and 
conducted problem analysis to know the core problem and its root cause(s). As previously discussed, the conflict 
minerals KBS is limited only to system requirements collection and strategy selection and overall design of conflict 
minerals KBS. This study opens to the exploration of the rest of the process in KBS methodology. Through the new 
automated system of the conflict minerals team, it is expected that they would be able to hit, and even exceed their 
target response rate and data reliability. In addition, the management will be more efficient, and the employees would 
be more productive in the business. These results hopefully affect the customer satisfaction rating of the company 
since it will provide more accuracy and faster services to the customers. Since the company still in its planning phase, 
the author suggests future tests, monitoring, and study to identify and verify efficiency results such as survey to end 
users. This will determine whether also the proposed system will be acceptable to users or not.

Abstract 
 
Software for image analysis endorsed further developments in the medical area that would accept state of the art 
reengineering processes to reproduce actual internal organs and structures of the human body. Previous research on 
FDM produced elements in the medicine field shown important discoveries on orthopedics. Preoperative planning 
shown to be suitable for additive manufacturing solutions that could help to improve the efficiency on procedures 
lowering potential risks after surgery. Accurate and well thought planning is necessary to choose the best way for the 
practice and deliver the best results. Tooling customization has shown to help into achieving this result. Bone-related 
surgeries require customized cutting guides for better accuracy. The following work aims to deliver the opportunity 
to use variations of Polylactic acid (PLA) based cutting guides in actual surgery practices by means of sustaining a 
regular heat-sterilization procedure without compromising its tailor-made characteristics. This would be possible by 
means of a proved, reliable procedure for obtaining the prototype from traditional CT scan images. As a result, HT-
PLA material composition and crystallization properties allowed to sustain a sterilization procedure in a way that does 
not compromise the reliability of the part, nor the safety of the procedure, so prototypes made with a similar process 
as the proposed one, can be used in actual surgery practices with safety.

Abstract  
 
The study aimed to evaluate supply chain management (SCM) performance and its impact on production, using G. 
Shankerdas & Sons Sierra Leone Ltd as a case study and clarified the key success factors that led the company to 
achieve high supply chain performance. Supply chain management (SCM) is a link that connects each element of the 
manufacturing processes right from the production phase to the delivery phase and to the end-user (customers) with 
fulfilling the quality triangle; that is, within optimized cost, minimal time and required quality. The key success factors 
comprise the relationships with customers and suppliers, information technology (IT), material flow management, 
corporate culture and performance measurement. Questionnaires were the main instruments for the study, and 
distributed to participants. The study employs descriptive analysis and explanations of data. The findings show that 
relationships exist between IT, management support, Environmental Uncertainty, Value-Added process and 
performance measurement and SCM performance, but not for corporate culture. It would be of recommendation that 
future study will determine additional success factors that are pertinent to the firm’s current SCM strategies and 
directions, competitive advantages and missions.

1. Introduction   
Research aims include adding value, reducing cost, or lowering response time in different parties involved in the 
supply chain (Habib, 2014). In today's rapidly changing business environment, people are increasingly focusing on 
providing value to customers at the lowest possible cost.  Production company regardless of the size, one must focus 
on how to provide products and services while keeping costs low. The ultimate purpose of establishing a profit 
organization is to maximize profit for shareholders. In other words, all organizations are trying to increase their 
revenue and reduce costs. Manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers frequently deal with large amounts of 
supply chain of various types. According to Mofokeng et al. (2017)  Improving performance, particularly supply chain 
performance, is essential, and in recent years, there has been a trend towards identifying ways in which supply chains 
can become more competitive. With so many supply chain management issues to deal with, items can easily be 
misappropriated, misplaced or lost. These days, the new source of business competition lies outside the walls of 
organizations, and it has been determined by how effectively companies link their operations with their supply chain 
partners (Petrovic-Lazarevic et al. 2012). The supply chains may require specialized systems that keep track of 
everything in an organized manner. As such, the associated cost of carrying a supply chain represents a significant 
portion of the cost of running most businesses. In this context, this research attempts to use G. Shankerdas & Sons to

782","the relationship is, and in what direction the relationship goes. The strength of the relationship lies between -1 to +1. 
In order to know whether the relationship is strong or weak, the research used this rule of thumb. From -1 to 1 the 
correlation is strong, from -0.9 to -0.7 up to 0.7 to 0.9 the correlation is strong, from -0.6 to -0.4 up to 0.4 to 0.6 the 
correlation is moderate, and from -0.3 to -0.1 up to 0.1 to 0.3 the correlation is weak. The negative and positive reflect 
the direction of the relationship. A negative correlation implies that as the values of one variable increases, the value 
of the other variable decreases, while for positive correlation means that as one value of one variable increases, the 
value of the other variable will also increase. 
 
The correlation coefficient for Information technology and Environmental uncertainty is positive 0.809. Regarding 
the strength of the correlation, 0.809 has a strong correlation. Since the P-value (0.000) is less than (0.05) it therefore 
suggests that the correlation is statistically significant at a 5% level. 
 
Information technology and Management support have a positive correlation of 0.755. The strength of the correlation 
0.755, in this case, is strong. Since the P-value (0.000) is less than 0.05, it indicates that the correlation is significant 
at a 5% level. The correlation coefficient that exists between information technology and Value-Added Process is 
positive 0.686. Since the P-value (0.000) is smaller than 0.05, it means that the correlation is statistically significant 
at a level of 5%. The result shows that there is a moderate linear relation between enabling infrastructure and 
performance.  
 
The Pearson correlation for Environmental uncertainty and Management support is 0.890. P-Value = 0.00. The table 
indicates that the strength of association between the variables is very high (r = 0.890), and that the correlation is 
positive and highly significant for P < 0.05.  
The descriptive analysis results revealed that the correlation between Environmental uncertainty and Value- Added 
Process at 2 tail that is (r = 0.857, P< 0.05). This implies that there is a strong positive relationship between 
Environmental uncertainty and Value- Added Process.     
 
The correlation coefficient for Management support and Value- Added Process is positive 0.862 which means that the 
relationship between Management support and Value- Added Process have positive properties. The strength of the 
correlation is strong because the P-value (0.000) is smaller than (0.05). This implies that the correlation between 
Management support and the Value- Added Process is statistically significant at 5% level 
 
5. Conclusions  
Based on the topic under consideration, a problem statement was developed with a specific objective in mind, and 
data was collected, presented, analyzed, and interpreted. From the research findings, it is concluded that the SCM 
systems have a very great impact on the aspects of productivity, profitability and the overall performance of the 
operations. outsourcing, IT, strategic partnership and management support affected the performance of the production 
sector. In terms of outsourcing, lack of expertise, high-quality services and strict timelines influenced performance to 
a great extent; lack of expertise in the production industries affected the performance of production in mobilization to 
executing competitive strategies. As a result, the role of IT influenced the implementation of competitive strategies in 
the manufacturing industries because it pushed for the adoption of appropriate roles that improved the company's 
performance. Proper strategic partnerships affect the performance of production companies. Finally, it can be said that 
globalization affects performance through its advantages and its roles. The researchers also believes that the operations 
of the unit are caused by several problems but have hastened to suggest recommendations through which these 
problems can be mitigated. 
 
6. Recommendations 
Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that institutions should improve the mode of outsourcing for 
them to meet the needs of their customers and to ensure they receive their goods on time. They should choose a mode 
that is appropriate and will maximize the goals and objectives of the organization to enable the execution of the 
competitive strategies in place that enhance performance.  Further, it is recommended that using technology that does 
not support the crucial realization of objectives should be sidestepped by first ensuring that all employees are well 
inducted into their roles and space in service delivery by using the appropriate technology. Because information 
technology is the primary source of improvement in the supplier-customer relationship, the flow of information and 
access to information should be a top priority. The company should also ensure they frequently embark on training 
staff in the form of workshops in other to overcome the challenges that hinder production. Finally, the management

activities of the company.

Abstract 
Covid-19 was declared a widespread pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in early March 
2020. It was first discovered in China and quickly spread across the world, prompting world governments to take 
strict steps to isolate cases and slow the virus's transition rate. Indonesia government is trying to keep growth and 
welfare impacts from leading to a very severe scenario. This research aims to understand the impact of Covid-19 
towards the infrastructure sector in Indonesia and to identify strategies used in infrastructure companies to survive 
during Covid-19 by empirical study. Covid-19 has negative impacts on revenue and expenses of the top nine 
infrastructure companies in Indonesia. However, most companies applied defensive strategies as their acts to survive 
and intensive strategy as their act to retain the source of revenue.

1. Introduction 
 
Covid-19 was declared a widespread pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in early March 
2020. It was first discovered in China and quickly spread across the world, prompting world governments to take 
strict steps to isolate cases and slow the virus's transition rate (Ibn-Mohammed et al., 2021). This pandemic has 
dramatically changed life in every corner of the world and countries were struggling to maintain their country’s 
economy. Based on the BPS (National Statistic Centre) survey, businesses that hit hardest are those in the industries 
of accommodations, food and drinks, transportation, warehousing, construction, and processing. They are the most 
vulnerable to falling demand and long logistics chains as a result of self-imposed restrictions. 
Economic activity contracted, unemployment rose sharply, commodity prices fell sharply, and the financial 
sector became volatile. Indonesia's economic growth in Q1-2020 was only 2.97%. Under normal conditions, 
Indonesia's economic growth in 2020 is estimated to reach 5.3%. However, the pandemic situation reduced the 
government's projection figure to -0.4% (worst case scenario) to 2.3%. The slow pace of economic growth is 
estimated to have an impact on termination of employment, thereby increasing the poverty rate. Kacaribu (2020) 
said the escalation of COVID-19 and a sharp economic slowdown must be mitigated by its impact on people's 
welfare - through extraordinary policies. The government is trying to keep growth and welfare impacts from leading 
to a very severe scenario. 
Strategy is the development of different and profitable activities, requiring a broad selection of tasks. If there 
was only one ideal setting, there would be no need for strategy (Porter, 1996). There are 11 different types of 
alternative strategies that a company might follow: forward integration, backward integration, horizontal integration, 
market penetration, market development, product development, related diversification, unrelated diversification, 
retrenchment, divestiture, and liquidation (David, 1985). In addition, financial valuations were most suitable in 
strategy-performance studies (Kurniati & Nurcahyo, 2018).

During COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the top 9 infrastructure companies executed diverse survival 
strategies to maintain the company’s stability. Based on the data gathered in annual revenue, shows that the 
companies are struggling to lessen the reduction of annual revenue – which PP (Persero) Tbk. succeed to maintain 
only 32.84% annual revenue reduction in 2020 (Table 3.). The strategies done by PP (Persero) Tbk. was detailed in 
Table 5. 
Another interesting strategy was done by Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk. by seeing the profit ratio from 2019 to 
2020. The profit ratio was obtained from the calculation of annual expense divided by annual revenue. In Table 4. 
shows the expense-revenue ratio in percentage, with the lowest value means that the company has the lowest 
expense and thus triggers highest profit. Table 4 presents Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk. has the lowest expense-revenue 
ratio both in 2019 and 2020 with 60.93% and 75.54% respectively. The strategies done by Jasa Marga (Persero) 
Tbk. identified in Table 5.

5. Conclusion 
 
Covid-19 has negative impacts on revenue and expenses of infrastructure companies in Indonesia. However, 
most companies applied defensive strategies as their acts to survive. From top 9 infrastructure companies, we found 
that Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk and PP (Persero) Tbk has the lowest decline of the annual revenue and lowest 
expense-revenue ratio. Best practice done by Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk was defensive strategies such as limiting the 
operational activities, postpone some infrastructure construction, reduce overhead and administration cost, evaluate 
and prioritize work programs through all businesses, and shifting operation schedule. In addition, they also maintain 
communication with banks and other financial institutions to ensure standby facilities. On the other hand, to save the 
financial condition, PP (Persero) Tbk reduce production costs, tight money policy, CAPEX efficiency, debts 
restructuration, merge in internal organization and assets divestment. 
Despite the unpredictable condition during Covid-19, the companies still have the optimism to develop their 
market by applying intensive strategies. In first-half 2020, PP (Persero) Tbk was pursuing new contracted projects 
and they focused on receivable collections to fulfil their annual target. What Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk has done in 
second-half 2020 was prioritizing both operational and capital expense to road-maintenance, and they also initiating 
new projects of highway construction.  
The limitation of this research was focusing only on revenue and sales expense performance. We emphasize the 
empirical study about the infrastructure sector in Indonesia. The future research may consider the additional 
information such as tax incentive from government, debt payable and other investment activities done by the 
company.

Abstract 
 
More than 150 million people have been infected with COVID-19 (covid19.go.id 2021), which has affected day-to-
day life and is slowing down the global economy (Haleem et al. 2020), including the challenges of business 
sustainability, especially Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs). The objective of this paper is to explore the impact 
of competitive strategies application on company profitability. Will it maintain the company's old strategy? Through 
observations, Tatuis's profitability and operation are generally good due to its accurate competitive strategic 
positioning. With the company's agility and ability to see opportunities, changing competitive strategies to increase 
profits. Therefore, this preparation of this paper would like to clarify the concepts of fair, competitive strategy that 
have a positive effect on the company profitability. At the same time, this paper puts forward some views on 
implementing the strategy for the Tatuis that take as the typical one to implement the cost leadership strategy while 
retaining its differentiation strategy. In addition, this paper also provides broader and more precise information, 
providing new ways for companies to get through times of crisis on how companies should respond to concerns such 
as COVID-19 at the level of a competitive strategy.

1. Introduction 
The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has attracted global attention (Saadat et al. 2020) since 
December 2019. The first time it occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, then its disease outbreak caused a new 
severe disease with an acute respiratory syndrome, namely the virus corona 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Harapan et al. 2020). 
Many countries have an idea of lockdown (stay at home), travel restrictions, and isolation is the most successful 
preventive measures (Aragaw 2020). Increased capacity for testing and community transmission, allowing confirmed 
cases and deaths to increase, occurs even though most countries have closed their borders to prevent unnecessary 
travel and immigration (Nzediegwu and Chang 2020). The tremendous influence in various industries and sectors is 
due to the causes of this disease (Haleem et al. 2020). 
 
The recommendation to use masks is part of a comprehensive strategy in preventing and controlling the spread of 
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (WHO 2020; Harapan et al. 2020; Saadat et al. 2020). During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, wearing masks has become a common habit as personal protection in every activity (Hartanto 
and Mayasari 2021). Avoiding touching the face, maintaining a physical distance of 1 meter, hand hygiene, breathing 
ethics, adequate indoor ventilation arrangements, contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine are also infection 
prevention and control (IPC) measures that must be considered (WHO 2020). Considering a small retrospective cohort 
study from Beijing suggesting that the use of masks by the whole family before the first family member develops 
symptoms of COVID-19 is 79% effective in reducing transmission. The Thailand case study also reinforced that 
wearing the medical or non-medical mask during contact with COVID-19 patients can reduce the risk of infection by 
up to 77% (WHO 2020). 
 
It is not surprising, the increasing consumption of disposable masks has led to an increase in mask waste and particular 
a problem for the environment (Hartanto and Mayasari 2021), mainly surgical masks made of polymeric materials,

800",,"able to become a trendsetter for this product. However, this strategy was certainly not sufficient to overcome the 
company's operations when the pandemic began. New emergent strategy based on the existing situation and conditions 
testing the leader's skills proves that profitability and activities can maintain business continuity. 
 
Secondly, fabric masks as a means of product diversification started in April 2020. The high market demand, creating 
opportunities, and a decrease in products deliberate since the beginning because of the influence of the COVID-19 
outbreak. Tatuis produces fabric masks as an implementation of a cost leadership strategy. This strategy allows Tatuis 
to offer competitive prices. As we know, the government recommendation on using fabric masks has increased the 
number of competitors, so we cannot deny the price competition. Using existing resources, starting from the 
availability of raw materials, and limiting the number of employees, it is shown that Tatuis’s financial performance is 
getting better, as indicated by a high increase in asset turnover (2020) from previous years. It shows Tatuis's success 
in intensifying its assets to adopt cost leadership as an emergent strategy. 
 
Thirdly, the COVID-19 outbreak is considered unexpected and has had a significant impact that is inevitable for many 
companies. It ultimately assists us to be concerned about how companies should respond to this crisis and what actions 
to take at a strategic level. To survive all kinds of concerns, the company must prepare a competitive strategy for 
diversification. Tatuis used to have a relatively single strategic position, namely a differentiation strategy, and the 
pressure hit the core of the company's profits. An appropriate combination of strategies needs to be implemented to 
anticipate the unexpected. If the Tatuis adheres to one strategy, it will be difficult for them to have sufficient capital 
and flexible size to compete. They are more likely not to extend support activities within the company and eventually 
lead to bankruptcy - quite a few companies have gone bankrupt due to the pandemic. 
 
As a diversified company, Tatuis's response to a crisis is relatively more flexible. Diverse product developments and 
innovations help companies overcome risks. During the COVID-19 outbreak, not all companies have experienced the 
same difficulties. Demand for mukena and sajdah is likely to decline during COVID-19. Therefore, Tatuis is seeking 
reasonable product diversification to diversify risks, such as producing fabric masks. They understand how much 
people need masks during a pandemic. However, companies need to know that they cannot always apply the same 
strategy to every product. Tatuis decided to use a cost leadership strategy for fabric masks because of consumer 
sensitivity to product prices. Then, diversified companies are more flexible in operations, and they can adjust their 
business strategies to maximize profits in response to different circumstances. In short, after encountering a significant 
crisis in all parts of the world, companies should consider developing their strategy in the future. It is not always a bad 
thing to diversify a business under capital and other conditions. 
 
This paper only focuses on the Tatuis case study, representing the many fashion companies that struggled during the 
outbreak and found ways to stay competitive by diversifying their business. However, because the study is limited to 
focusing on a specific type of company, it only discusses companies pursuing other competitive strategies to survive 
in the industrial competition. Future research should explore various firms to perform data analysis and incorporate 
several non-financial performance measures such as customer loyalty.

Abstract 
 
In light of the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, public life and industrial sectors have been 
significantly restricted as the attempt to curb the spread of the pandemic, which reduced the overall 
world energy demand. This study aims to explore the impact of competitive strategy on the 
operational and financial performances of an Indonesian coal mining company during COVID-19 
pandemic. This study takes Adaro Energy as the object of the case study with analysis on 
operational aspects including coal production, sales volume, overburden removal, and lost time 
injury frequency rate. While financial data is analyzed by using the method formulated in Decree 
of Ministry of State Owned Company KEPMEN 100/MBU/2002, where eight financial indicators 
that cover profitability, liquidity, activity, and solvability are used to calculate companies’ 
financial health. Through this study, it is found that Adaro Energy’s operational and financial 
performances were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it is also found 
that Adaro Energy’s cost leadership strategy implementation was able alleviate the negative impact 
of the pandemic and assisted the company in maintaining its performances. Therefore, this study 
helps to understand the concept of how the appropriate competitive strategy could assist 
organizations in navigating under rapid changes and uncertainty in their industries.

1. Introduction 
Strategy is an integral part of organizations. According to Porter (1985), strategies allow organizations to 
gain competitive advantage from 3 different bases, which are leadership strategy, differentiation strategy and focus 
strategy. Cost leadership emphasizes producing standardized products at a low per-unit cost for consumers who are 
price-sensitive. Differentiation strategy aimed at producing products and services considered unique industrywide and 
directed at consumers who are relatively price-insensitive. While focus strategy emphasize in producing products and 
services that fulfil the needs of small groups of consumers (Porter, 1985). Strategies also assist organizations in 
navigating under rapid changes and uncertainty in their industries and general environment (Hitt et al., 2010), ranging 
from economic crisis to global pandemic. 
In late 2019, COVID-19 pandemic started to occur in China. By the end of Q1 2020, the pandemic had spread 
around the globe. COVID-19 impacted not only the lives of the people, but also the activities of many industrial 
sectors. During the pandemic, lockdowns and social distancing were imposed by the government which led to the 
reduction of industrial activities in many countries. The reduction of industrial activities decreases the demand for 
energy. According to statistical data from International Energy Agency (IEA, 2020), the demand for energy in 2020

811","Adaro Energy’s overall financial performance in the past 5 years can be categorized as healthy with grade 
AA in 2016 – 2019. However, in 2020, the financial health of Adaro decreased to grade A, with total weight of 66 %. 
The decline of performance in 2020 was attributed to the average global coal price which decreased drastically from 
US$ 77.89/ton FOB Newcastle in 2019 to US$ 60.79/ton FOB Newcastle in 2020 or US$ 17.10/ton decrease y-o-y 
(Indexmundi, 2020). While the average price of Indonesian coal decreased from US$ 77.89/ton in 2019 to US$ 
58.17/ton or US$ 19.72/ton decrease y-o-y (Directorate General of Mineral and Coal, 2020). 
The decline on coal prices arises from oversupply of seaborne thermal coal due to the reduced global seaborne 
coal demand during COVID-19 pandemic. The decline of export demand significantly affected Adaro Energy’s sales 
where export market is a majority of sales that contributes to around 80 % of Adaro Energy’s total coal sales volume 
(Adaro Energy Annual Report, 2020). However, despite the decrease of Adaro’s coal sales and production, and the 
decrease of global coal prices, Adaro Energy still managed to maintain strong financial performance health which is 
grade A. 
 
5.3 Impact of strategy on financial and operational performance of Adaro Energy 
On its operational process, Adaro Energy focused on increasing efficiency in order to achieve optimal output and 
lowest costs. They were achieved by optimization of the mine plan, hauling distances for both overburden and coal, 
and strip ratios, while taking into account the preservation of reserves and geotechnical aspects, as well as the coal 
supply chain by strengthening communication networks, and increasing the unit's effective working hours production. 
To further generate low-cost operation, Adaro Energy implements vertical integration business model which integrate 
pit to power through its subsidiaries including coal mining, service and logistics, and power. This business model 
allows for control in the entire coal supply chain and enable Adaro Energy to respond quickly to ever-changing 
environment. This business model succeeds in differentiating Adaro Energy itself from other mining company. 
According to Porter (1985), increasing profits by reducing costs, while charging industry-average prices can be 
classified as cost leadership strategy. Therefore, based on information on Adaro Energy’s operational strategy and 
literature, we can infer that Adaro Energy adopts cost leadership strategy. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Adaro Energy ensures the continuation of its operational activities by enforcing 
a number of internal initiatives and regulations, including the establishment of the COVID-19 handling committee, 
the preparation of a medical emergency response plan (MERP) and the COVID-19 surveillance system, arrangements 
for employee departure and return from leave / field break / off, and formulation of procedures for COVID-19 case in 
the operational area (Adaro Energy Annual Report 2020). Adaro Energy also attempted to help restore balance to the 
coal market and to aim for better cost control, by reducing its coal production target by 10 % and total overburden 
removal in 2020 by 23 % y-o-y. This is in line with Indonesian government’s strategy to reduce Indonesian annual 
coal production in 2020. Despite those attempts, COVID-19 pandemic still negatively impacts Adaro Energy’s 
financial performance, which result in the decline of the company’s financial health from 85 % in 2019 to 66 % in 
2020. However, due to Adaro Energy’s cost leadership strategy, the decline of the company’s financial health is not 
as severe and Adaro Energy still managed to maintain healthy balance sheet, which is shown by Adaro’s financial 
performance health as grade A. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In 2020, to Adaro Energy reduced its coal production target by 10 % to 52 – 54 million tons. Adaro Energy's 
annual coal production in 2020 decreased by 6 % y-o-y to 54.53 million tons, coal sales in 2020 decreased by 9% y-
o-y to 54.14 million tons, and total overburden removal in 2020 decreased by 23% y-o-y. They are in line with the 
company's guidance to lower the company's ratio to better cost control under challenging situations arising from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The company's Health, Safety and Environmental team also implemented a number of internal 
initiatives and regulations in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 which is critical to business continuity. Adaro 
Energy recorded a high safety performance in 2020. Adaro Energy recorded no fatalities, and achieved LTIFR (Lost 
Time Injury Frequency Rates) of 0.01, out of a total of 74,360,750 hours of working hours. 
The financial performance of Adaro Energy which was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can be 
measured by the method formulated in the Decree of the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises KEPMEN 
100/MBU/2002. The result shows that Adaro Energy's performance in 2016 – 2019 can be categorized as healthy with 
AA grade and decreased in 2020 to grade A with total weight of 66. The decrease of Adaro Energy’s financial health 
in 2020 is primarily caused by the decline of average global thermal coal prices by US$ 17.10/ton (Indexmundi, 2020) 
and average Indonesian thermal coal prices by US$ 19.72/ton (Directorate General of Mineral and Coal, 2020) y-o-y. 
The price decline was attributed to the decrease in global coal demand in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract  
 
Food snack organization in the Republic of South Africa is a basic aspect of the food conveyance framework, any 
place for food manufacturing and circulation inside the nation locale unit is profoundly influenced by snack food 
business activities. This investigation assesses the Food Security as well as Quality Control Systems of the food-
making industry and tries to observe their issues in their usage. Reviews are controlled to general workers, bosses, 
and supervisors of 414 food-snack organizations in the two provinces of South African namely Gauteng and 
Mpumalanga. In preparation of this methodology, both primary and secondary data have been utilized. The Primary 
data were chiefly collected from a sample of workers from targeted companies and front-line executives through 
survey. Then Secondary data is then collected from entirely different sources such as company websites and publicised 
journals of the organizations and as well as from other relevant books. The main aim of this investigation is to 
examines the components of management operations within the snack industry and to single out challenges faced by 
snack food industries to follow correct Quality Control Systems.

1. Introduction 
The risk of foodborne diseases is continually developing with numerous upgrades in food production and utilization. 
Considering these progressions and difficulties, with an end goal to monitor customers, nations are getting stricter in 
their observation and guidelines. Pretty much every country around the globe, in extraordinary ways, many countries 
(governments) have spent significant time in food security (Duffey KJ, 2016). (Arnjadi, 2015)  
 
In the Republic of South Africa, the benefit of overseeing food contamination flare-ups has been progressively 
monitored because of the developing number of snack food items consumed every day with the ever-growing of snack 
foods and pre-arranged snack foods. There has been an absence of public information on the seriousness of the issue, 
and no legitimate body and guidelines under which the overall population should reply/ report any cases or instances 
of food contamination. (Griffith, 2018) 
Basically, these snack foods items are not really remembered on the shopping list of many people, yet they are 
regularly inside the stores, the drug store, and some other stores where people shop. (Khatri, 2017)  (Pun, 2017) 
 
In South Africa, the snack food industry is an important part of the food delivery system, where food production and 
distribution in the country are strongly encouraged by the company's operations. It is driven by women, who usually 
process food items on a small scale (Duffey 2016). The increasing spread of snack enterprise across the country has 
given rise to several products available on the market, even though most of them are unregistered and are not currently 
on the market. Although most of them are unregistered and are not currently licensed by regulatory companies 
consisting of the Food and Drugs Authority and the Standards Authority of South Africa. (Kujho, 2017). 
Consumers are vulnerable to food-borne hazards that may additionally manifest themselves at any point in 
manufacturing processes, and thus a food safety and/or quality control system is the primary necessity for any food 
processing activity. (Kerr MA, 2020). Examples of such systems are the HACCP and IS0 22000 systems. There are

821","system in snack food industries, interest be paid to the strategies identified and tips developed through this 
Consultation. 
It is encouraged that snack food industries in South Africa, such as in Gauteng and Mpumalanga, set up a central 
database of existing publications consisting of information on their scope, language and supposed use and make it 
accessible thru an internet site. 
 
A. DISCUSSION 
While food cleanliness has a wide scope of exercises among food and refreshment activities and is basically the 
obligation of the executives, the job that each specialist plays in the usage of the food cleanliness framework cannot 
be disregarded. Regarding the Hazard Analysis of the item, the CCPs were mutually recognized as the individual 
activities distinguished in the risk examination of the item. The size and danger evaluation of every primary region of 
the strategy has likewise been surveyed. These contribute legitimately to serious issues in plant resistance, staff, 
hardware or administrations breakdown and contamination and pervasion. The data shows a consistent reducing 
pattern for every client's grumbling and rebelliousness with the usage of the HACCP system.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Food Safety Management System is poorly practiced in snack foods production firms in South Africa. The processes 
of most of the snack food firms do not conform with necessities a Food Safety Management Systems, to assure the 
security of food, that will result in the conceding of market approval by the authority. That is, most workers of the 
snack food company do not get market approvals and product certification from governing agencies. The main 
challenges faced by the snack food industries in executing Food Safety Management System is because of insufficient 
information on procedures that has food safety implications as well as substructure and suitable processing equipment 
necessities. The Food Safety Management System utilized by the snack food producing industries in South Africa 
needs to be supported through capacity and infrastructural investment to guarantee safe food production.

Abstract 
 
Additive manufacturing (AM) is recognized by many supply chain professionals and global automakers as the best 
alternatives to manage disruptions and boost automotive supply chain resilience. A semi-structured interview was 
conducted among Indian auto firms’ industry experts to determine the current status of AM implementation in the 
Indian auto industry. The industry experts of Indian and foreign-based automakers operating in India have suggested 
in-house AM production to tackle the upstream automotive supply chain’s complexity during disruptions. This 
choice’s significant cause is to protect the auto components’ design secrecy from private exposure and retain the firm’s 
competitive advantage. In addition, the overall difficulties prevailing in the outsourcing activities, particularly in the 
upstream automotive supply chain due to various uncertain events such as COVID-19, also influenced their choice 
towards in-house AM production. Hence, it is necessary to analyze the feasibility of initiating in-house AM production 
in the upstream automotive supply chain for the post-COVID-19 unusual scenario. The resource-based view (RBV) 
and knowledge-based view (KBV) of strategic sourcing are suitable for establishing in-house AM production in the 
OEM’s plant location. In this regard, a step-wise procedure has been proposed to guide OEM’s management towards 
significant adoption of in-house AM production. The RBV theory states that resources and capabilities have to be 
precious, unique, and organizationally active to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. 
 
The KBV theory, an extension of RBV theory, states that intangible resources, such as human capital and knowledge, 
are a firm’s unique resources to help achieve a competitive advantage. As per the RBV/KBV theories, the firms may 
contract outsourcing with the leading resource and knowledge providers to pass knowledge and resources currently 
not owned by the firm. With the guidance of RBV/KBV theories, OEM’s management has to make a short-term 
collaboration with an AM service provider to transfer the knowledge, human capital, and other resources from them 
to OEM. This short-term collaboration may help OEM to develop its internal capabilities with the knowledge and 
resource transfer offered by the AM service provider. Similarly, OEM can benefit from hiring technical personnel 
from the AM service provider to develop its employees’ knowledge and technical skills on AM.

Abstract 
 
The automotive industry is one of the largest and most complex industries around the world. The automotive industry 
needs to implement a long-term strategy for the company. Before the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, the automotive 
industry was projected to witness steady growth through the course of this decade. To restore the demand for the 
automotive industry in Indonesia, the Government will provide financial incentives in the form of a reduction in Sales 
Tax on Luxury Goods rates. The research methodology in this article uses Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and 
Qualitative Analysis (Segmentation and SWOT). In addition, Porter’s Strategy was utilized in this article to analyze 
automotive industry attractiveness from an outside-in perspective during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, a case 
study approach on Indonesia's automotive industry firms, e.g., Toyota and Daihatsu were employed. The analysis 
result acknowledged the application of Porter's generic strategies to automotive industry firms to achieve competitive 
advantage and proved the positive impact of generic strategies on firms' financial performance. This research 
contributes to existing research by suggesting Porter's generic strategies in the Indonesian automotive industry.

1. Introduction  
The automotive industry is one of the most complicated sectors. (Orsato and Wells 2007; Kannegiesser and Günther 
2014). Although the automotive sector is a critical industrial sector affecting the global economic system 
sustainability, car manufacturers and other companies in the automotive supply network's environmental and social 
output do not always meet the expectations of customers. (Koplin et al 2007; Orsato and Wells 2007). In response to 
this practical challenge, the automotive industry needs to implement a long-term strategy for the company. According 
to Michael Porter, company strategy can be divided into 3 types: cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. There are 
two types of cost leadership strategies and focus, namely low-cost and best value. So that there are 5 company 
strategies according to Porter, Porter's Five Generic Strategies (Gorondutse and Gawuna 2017).  Cost leadership and 
differentiation strategies can lead to organizational success according to Porter by understanding cost advantages and 
differentiation as discrete alternatives (Porter 1980). If the company has a competitive advantage in the market, it will 
support the success factors in the organization. 
Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the auto industry was projected to experience steady growth during this decade. 
The automotive industry is an important contributor to income in developing and developed countries in the world. 
The auto industry is often seen as the backbone of countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Therefore, solid 
economic growth depends to a large extent on how well the automotive industry is performing in a region. Increasing 
consumer income is one of the main drivers of growth in the automotive industry. (Kaitwade 2020). Whether it's 
increasing demand for electric vehicles or fast innovation, the auto industry has been booming before it was hit by the 
COVID-19 outbreak. Automotive manufacturing also appears to be affected by the negative impact of COVID-19. 
The coronavirus pandemic has caused a sharp drop in demand for automotive vehicles. The pandemic has hit the 
automotive world during 2020. A survey of 46 companies in the automotive supply chain, showed that nearly two-
thirds of respondents wanted a delay in implementing technology for the upcoming industrial launch. Nearly 65 
percent of companies put off implementing technology projects after the pandemic was over. Meanwhile, some of 
these auto companies have faced critical challenges even before the pandemic began.

5.2 Proposed Improvements  
This research is limited to 5 car brands in Indonesia with gasoline and MPV types. Then for the use of expert choice 
only use 1 expert. Future research may be able to hold a Focus Group Discussion with more than 3 experts to 
determine the score when compiling pair-wise comparisons. In addition, it is necessary to hold a more in-depth 
study using Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) to explain the objectives and then design the automotive industry 
activity system to achieve these goals. 
 
6. Conclusion  
By using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool, Toyota and Daihatsu in Indonesia are concluded using a Cost 
Leadership strategy. This conclusion is proven by the segmentation analysis which stated that Daihatsu segmented a 
relatively cheaper car market with the smallest price range. It is indicating that Daihatsu using focuses on a very 
specific market. It can conclude that the strategy used by Daihatsu is Cost Leadership Low-Cost. Meanwhile, Toyota 
is on the top brand. So that the strategy used by Toyota is Cost Leadership Best Value. Based on the SWOT analysis, 
it shows that the Automotive Industry during the Covid-19 pandemic was in quadrant I, which is the position of 
companies that support aggressive strategies. So, in general, the automotive industry still has many opportunities to 
reach the target market and the number of automotive sales in Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
The airline industry in Indonesia has shown smooth but steady growth. Moreover, the Indonesian government has 
begun to focus more on tourism exploration and building air infrastructure to attract domestic and foreign tourists. 
Garuda Indonesia and AirAsia are the airlines currently operating and own quite a big market share in Indonesia. 
The two airlines apply different strategies where one chooses differentiation and the other chooses cost leadership. 
This article will discuss how the two airlines have implemented their strategies to compete including responding to 
the conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic and how it affects their performance.

1. Introduction 
Being an archipelagic country, air transportation is one of the main types of transportation used by the people of 
Indonesia. Long distances and difficult terrain that the country had was able to be conquered by air transportation, a 
convenience that no other type of transportation could offer. These conditions offer a huge market for airlines. This 
large market is not only influenced by the size of the area and population, but also by the title of Indonesia as a tourist 
destination. The number of tourist arrivals from abroad continues to grow from year to year and it was reported that 
the average growth in these visits from 2015 to 2019 reached 13.6 percent (INACA Annual Report, 2019). In 2019, 
the number of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia reached 16.1 million, of which 9.83 million came using air 
transportation. 
 
There are 12 Indonesian airlines that have been operating in 2019. These airlines have implemented different 
strategies, such as providing cheap tickets, providing premium services, and serving unique routes. Regardless of 
the large potential of the existing market, existing airlines must have the right management and strategies in order to 
become the airline of choice for consumers. The wrong move will lead to bankruptcy, as happened to Batavia Air, 
apart from being a zero accidents airline. The good move will lead to the largest market share ownership such as that 
of Garuda Indonesia and AirAsia in the international market in 2018 and 2019. 
 
Year of 2020 has been a difficult year for the entire industry and the airline industry is one of the hardest hit. In Q1 
2020, at four major airports in Indonesia, namely in Jakarta, Bali, Medan and Surabaya, there was a decrease in 
domestic passengers by 44 and 45 percent for international passengers. Losses suffered by airlines from the four 
major airports, when compared to Q1 2018, reached around US $ 812 million. Airlines must be able to rack their 
brains to survive despite the decline in consumer demand for flight and government restrictions or bans on aircraft 
operations. 
 
This study will discuss how the Indonesian aviation industry grows and how airlines design strategies to be 
competitive. The object of this research is two Indonesian airlines, namely Garuda Indonesia and AirAsia. This 
research will not only discuss Porter's generic strategies that were applied but also how airlines react to Covid-19 
and the innovation they do.

842",,"were World's Best Low Cost Airline for eleven consecutive years, in 2009 until 2019. Regarding the number of 
passengers, AirAsia serves the highest number of them. 
 
Facing Covid-19 pandemic conditions in 2020, airlines have a huge loss of demand and profit. Both airlines in this 
study, Garuda Indonesia and AirAsia, should change and update their strategy. Garuda Indonesia improves strategy 
for customer experience performance, such as digitalization or online check-in, and optimizes flight routes with 
network connectivity, notably on international routes, with the improvement of the execution of marketing and sales. 
On the other hand, AirAsia is trying to develop new strategies in the recovery of this pandemic period. Some of the 
efforts made by AirAsia include actively managing its capacity since the beginning of February 2020. Then, perform 
strict internal cost controls such as temporary dismissals to hire new employees. AirAsia applying cost leadership 
strategy strives to continuously adopt cost saving measures. In this effort, AirAsia still upholds its commitment to 
be the lowest cost airline, but still prioritizes passenger service and safety. It has proven that Garuda Indonesia and 
AirAsia’s quick action based on their core strategies, whether it is differentiation or cost leadership, could quite 
recover their huge loss.

Abstract 
 
E-Commerce is playing a more significant part in the Indonesian economy. (Rashidirad, Salimian, Soltani, & Fazeli, 
2017) shows that an e-business without a clear competitive strategy is very unlikely to outperform; so that in order to 
succeed in the increasingly competitive environment of e-business, firms would need to carefully develop and 
implement successful competitive strategies. Competitive advantage grows fundamentally out of value a firm is able 
to create for its buyers that exceed the firm's cost of creating it. There is a general stream of strategy research that 
assesses strategy and firm performance (Dess & Davis, 1984; Fahey & Christensen, 1986; Miller & Cardinal, 1994; 
Kim & Lim, 1988). Considering its nature and objectives, the case study method will be considered as a suitable 
method for this research. The paper suggests that although cost leadership strategy is able to generate greater 
performance, pursuing a differentiation strategy can be more worthwhile and sustainable for e-commerce companies 
compared to cost leadership strategy. This research contributes to existing research by suggesting Porter's generic 
strategies as a valid and viable model for pure online firms which operate in the current e-business environment.

1. Introduction 
Today's businesses are faced with the challenge of whether to incorporate an e-commerce strategy 
into their business model and if so, how will they do it. Business strategy is indispensable to a company 
which can become more active and sensitive to future threats. For external factor, environmental uncertainty 
needs to be considered for improving their strategy (Ary Kurniati & Rahmat Nurcahyo, 2018). The retail 
business has been significantly influenced by online business. Shoppers currently have the decision to buy 
merchandise online as opposed to truly going to the store. The Web has permitted buyers to investigate items 
all the more completely and participate in examination shopping all the more without any problem. This has 
brought about a more taught and educated client. With the capacity to effortlessly buy products on the web 
and a more taught purchaser, retail organizations are straightforwardly confronted with the serious idea of 
internet buying. With the expanding number of retail organizations carrying out internet business 
methodologies as a plan of action, retail organizations today are continually confronted with rivalry and for 
recognizing strategies to meet or surpass their opposition. Accomplishing consumer loyalty likewise has 
gotten more significant in the present cutthroat retail commercial center. To accomplish this objective, 
organizations search for procedures to advertise their items in a superior way or a more novel way. 
 
1.1.  Objectives 
In a time where innovative advances move quickly, monetary turn of events and development 
happen so quickly in a country. The headway of innovation or computerized change which is getting quicker 
consistently makes it simpler for individuals to do exercises both in close to home and expert life, using 
applications, sites, which affect correspondence exercises with one another and purchasing and selling 
(exchanges). Reportal Digital Indonesia (2020), clarifies that there are 175.4 million web clients in Indonesia 
as of January 2020, an expansion of 17% from 2019, making web entrance in Indonesia at 64%. The 
increment in the quantity of web clients has a huge relationship with the absolute clients of computerized 
stages, for example, online media and commercial centers in Indonesia. As of January 2020, of the 160 
million clients of advanced stages, specifically online media in Indonesia as a mode of correspondence and 
extending the organization with infiltration of 59%, while in the commercial center of absolute web clients

853","5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The force of the internet advancements has worked with mass customization and given firms approaches to offer novel 
items and remarkable help. In any case, a differentiator online firm can be in danger when there is expanded expense 
differential between the minimal effort and the differentiator internet business organizations; this is because of the 
way that an ease online player can without much of a stretch propel clients to switch brands, so clients might forfeit 
the extra highlights that the differentiator internet business organizations offer for a tremendous expense saving. 
Moreover, there is a danger of rivalry whereby other E-commerce business organizations mimic items and 
administrations, which thus would limit the apparent contrasts. Like expense authority and separation procedures, a 
center methodology is probably going to be sought after by an e-business to look for upper hand through separation 
or cost administration in a distinct market fragment. E-commerce business organizations that seek after a center 
technique can target market fragments cautiously and offer customized items and administrations to clients by utilizing 
the Internet-based innovations (Sumer and Bayraktar, 2012). Internet business organizations can acquire upper hand 
by executing a center technique through sending assets across the worth chain to acquire greatest returns. This would 
recommend that online firms should guide their showcasing exercises to specific clients and give enhanced the center 
items or administrations (Bakos, 1998). Besides, a center methodology empowers an internet business organization to 
limit the reaction time to clients' solicitations and improve clients' administration based on customized corporations 
by utilizing on the web data advances (Kim et al., 2004). Technological development nowadays tends to seamlessly 
grow, including in digital payment technology. This has brought structural changes in the banking industry, which 
emerged the industry to change into new digital banking services. (Yulianti, et al.  2019). This perspective should 
also be considered by the e-commerce companies in order to enlarge and gain the customer development and customer 
satisfaction in the end. Customer satisfaction is regarded as a response occurring at a particular time and towards a 
specific focus (Fainusa, et al. 2019) 
 
5.4 Validation  
Our examination shows that a separation technique will in general be sought after by E-commerce companies 
dependent on modified items and additional benefits, which are viewed as selective and profoundly esteemed by 
clients. E-commerce companies can achieve separation benefits when the cost charges surpass the extra costs that are 
experienced in being one of a kind (Booth et al., 2011). A differentiator online firm should look for techniques for 
separating itself from different contenders the same to guard cost charges at a level higher than the expense 
experienced by separating. The Internet and online advances empower the differentiator E-commerce business 
organizations to coordinate with clients through mass customization, which improves the way that E-commerce 
companies respond constantly to the clients' requests. It ought to be noticed that mass customization has gotten 
progressively famous with the development of adaptable assembling frameworks (Mourtzis, 2016). The Internet has 
extensively improved the cycle of mass customization as it brings clients near the firm and worked with the immediate 
correspondence between them (Pine, 1993; Goldman, Nagel and Preiss (1995); Anderson, 1997). In this way, mass 
customization empowers E-commerce companies to improve their item contributions, support their standing for 
quality, maintain their image picture, and decline costs simultaneously (Mourtzis, 2016). 
 
6. Conclusion 
If you refer to data from iPrice, Tokopedia is currently the most popular marketplace in Indonesia with the highest 
download rate on the Play Store (see table). The marketplace that occupies the second most popular position in 
Indonesia is Bukalapak, followed by Blibli. In fact, the three big brands also experienced an increase in transactions 
almost simultaneously. Like Bukalapak, the e-commerce company founded by Achmad Zaky has reported an increase

859","in transactions of up to 18 percent recently. The potential for increased sales can actually be seen from the increasing 
number of merchants joining Tokopedia, consumers in Indonesia are not loyal consumers of one brand. When they 
saw there was no discount, they moved right away. And it has been tested several times. These are the keywords of 
Tokopedia's success that make it a successful fee structure company, profit from economies of scale, and have a solid 
customer base. The companies under study consider innovation, production efficiency, and customer orientation as 
the basis of their competitive advantage. This article proposes that a cost leadership strategy is able to generate greater 
performance for e-commerce companies. However, since the internet offers e-commerce companies the possibility of 
cutting costs down as well as prices, a differentiation strategy can be more worthwhile and sustainable for e-commerce 
companies.

Abstract  
 
In the context of the outbreak of Covid-19, production and sales have been influenced greatly. This paper take Paper 
Company’s  as the case study of relationship between business sustaibability and competitive adventage in a price 
sensitive market. Through a cost leadership strategy we can analyze the waste paper A5 requirement for brown paper 
products amid the increasing in raw material. The result of this analysis will prove wether during the pandemic Covid-
19 there has been a change in demand for brown paper and will affect the need for raw material. Therefore, this paper 
helps clarify the concept that a reasonable comprtitive strategy has a positif effect on the business sustainability.

1. Introduction  
In December 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia of initially unknown cause was detected in Wuhan (Hubei, China), 
and  was  quickly  determined  to  be  caused by a novel coronavirus (WHO, 2020), namely Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Covid-19 pandemic has spread across the world rapidly which has 
increased the number of positive case of Covid-19. Indonesia was first detected of Covid-19 on March 2, 2020, when 
two people were confirmed to be infected by a Japanese national. 
 
The COVID-19 transmission is reported to be directly and indirectly, directly through droplets when coughing, 
indirectly when someone touches the surface of an object that has a virus and then touching the mouth, nose, eyes 
before washing a hand. WHO recommends doing physical distancing by keeping a distance and avoiding crowds and 
using masks (WHO, Covid-19, Geneva; 2020) to prevent and control the pandemic. As a result the goverments of the 
world’s larges countries have enforced border shutdown, travel restriction, and quarantine, thus sparking fear of an 
impending financial recession and economic crises (Yousfi et al 2021). 
 
Many Industries are aware of dramatic impact of Covid-19 on their production and sales are declining. Since the onset 
of the Covid-19 outbreak, Industries in Indonesia have faced sales challenges including logistical disruptions caused 
by movement restrctions implemented to slow Covid-19. Further, on paper companies in Indonesia. 
 
The paper company is a trade name of pulp and paper manufacturing company which delivers quality products to meet 
the growing global demand such as brown paper or kraft paper.  Brown paper are biodegradable, recyclable, and 
environmentally friendly products that are used for packaging in many countries, however during the pandemic the 
need for brown paper with raw materials was inversely related. In this case, to keep sustainable business, the company 
are needed to have a business strategy to keep competitive with competitors which is called a competitive adventage. 
Porter (1980) distinguished three categories of competitive strategies, which are called Generic Competitive 
Strategies. The purpose of these strategies is to create a long-term competitive advantage and a possibility to 
outperform competitors in a given industry. Cost leadership helps a company to gain a competitive advantage over 
competitors in price sensitive markets. Businesses that use a cost leadership strategy will be more profitable than 
competitors at the same price point. 
 
Based on the above background, this paper will focus on discussing the effect of competitive advetages to busniness 
sustainability.

5.1 Proposed Improvements  
Through the results of this discussion, for future research the authors suggest the paper company’s can utilize waste 
paper from internal companies, so that they can reduce procurement costs and add local waste sources. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results analyzed, the A5 waste procurement arrangements have an effect on business sustainability. The 
strategy chosen in this case is cost leadership in which the company will maintain product prices amid rising raw 
material prices during a pandemic Covid-19. For this reason, the company provides a safety stock of raw materials 
that were ordered before the pandemic to overcome the increasing demand for brown paper products during the 
pandemic. The orders for imported raw materials prior to the pandemic were increased more than the actual required. 
So that the company can still provide brown paper products for customers who need it.

Abstract 
 
This paper highlights the implementation of cost leadership and differentiation strategy by the cement industry to gain 
competitive advantage. As formulated by Porter, cost leadership is one of the generic strategies framework that 
emphasizes on cost formulation processes, while differentiation allows a company to charge a higher price for its 
product or services to gain customer loyalty. For the last decades, development of infrastructures has been rapidly 
increasing globally, resulting in the growth of the cement industry. This creates competition in the cement industry 
requiring companies to determine and implement strategic initiatives to secure business sustainability. This research 
was conducted to define the contributing factors and present how cost leadership and differentiation strategy was 
implemented by cement companies to strategically maintain the cost of goods sold and implement product 
development affecting positively to the company's financial performance, as well as to overcome issues related to cost 
involved in its operation. Furthermore, the analysis also identifies which one is the most significant strategic initiative 
supporting cost leadership strategy affecting cost of goods sold. This research proves that cost leadership’s strategic 
initiatives and product development affects positively to the financial performance of the companies in a highly 
competitive market.

1. Introduction  
Cement is one of the main industries and economic contributors in the world. Cement as the major component of 
concrete is commonly used as one of the main materials for infrastructure and buildings. It had a total production 
volume of about 6 billion m3 in 2017 globally (Hache et al. 2019). Cement acts as the glue for concrete to construct 
buildings, roads, bridges, dams and other infrastructure (Potgieter 2012). Concrete is second only to water in terms of 
its use by mankind (Hansson 1995).  
 
According to Schlorke (2020), there were over 1,000 cement producers operating over 2,300 integrated cement plants 
and more than 600 grinding stations all over the world. Based on information obtained by CW Research in 2020, there 
are five countries that cover almost three-quarters of the world's cement production, with China leading with a 57-
percent share globally, then followed by India, Vietnam, the United States, and Indonesia. Each country faces different 
challenges in its cement production and operation processes due to different socio-economic conditions, cultures, and 
regulations in each country.  
 
However, almost all cement producers face challenges regarding business sustainability. The increasing energy 
consumption, raw material, distribution and manufacturing cost undoubtedly affect the financial health of the cement 
producers. The arrival of new competitors in the industry by selling at lower prices also gives threats to the incumbent, 
requiring the firm to take strategic actions on their overall business. McKinsey (2015) conducted a research using

p-value of manufacturing cost is below 0.05, indicating this initiative is the most significant initiative to the cost of 
goods sold.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This research utilises a case study approach using PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) Tbk. as the company case study 
representing the cement industry. This research aims to understand strategic initiatives influencing cost leadership and 
differentiation strategies implemented by the cement industry and to identify which one is the significant cost 
leadership initiatives affecting the cost of goods sold. Authors use secondary data from the annual report within 2011 
to 2020.  
 
The strategic initiatives such as controlling energy, raw material, distribution and manufacturing cost could slow down 
the growth rate of cost of goods sold, altering positively to financial performance of the company. The company also 
pursues differentiation strategies by implementing product development to increase the revenue from the non-cement 
sector. Moreover, the result of the research identifies manufacturing cost as the significant strategic initiatives 
contributing to the cost leadership strategy implementation. 
 
This research provides practical contribution to the firm implementing cost leadership and differentiation strategy, 
especially in the cement industry. The limitation of this research lies in the lack of annual financial performance data

Abstract 
 
International competition, particularly in the forest products industry, is constantly increasing; even the largest 
companies have had to adapt to keep their market share. A successful strategy, for enterprises to remain competitive, 
is to establish collaborations with other business entities in order to access new markets and satisfy customer demand. 
The goal of this paper is to investigate the relevance of collaboration in the forest products industry via a systematic 
literature review method and explore the proposed collaboration mechanisms, main drivers, benefits, facilitators, and 
challenges of collaboration. A total of 70 articles were reviewed and results demonstrate the importance of 
collaboration in the forest products industry. Joint practices and contractual and economic practices are among the 
most popular collaboration mechanisms identified. Furthermore, lack of trust and developing a win–win collaboration 
condition seem to be the key challenges in this industry. On the other hand, cost based strategy, sustainability and 
environmental performance, and competition are among the principal drivers and benefits faced by the sector. Finally, 
financial incentives, bonuses and subsidies are the most important facilitators. A framework for inter-firm 
collaboration in the forest products supply chain is proposed in order to help firms identify the best-fit collaborative 
mechanisms for their particular collaborative initiative.

 Introduction  
Canada, with its 347 million hectares of forest, which represent 9 % of the world forests, is the third- most forested 
country in the world.  In 2018, the forest sector in Canada employed 204,555 people.  In 2019, it contributed $23.7 
billion to Canada’s nominal gross domestic product while the export value was about $33 billion (Natural Resources 
Canada, 2020). According to Natural Resources Canada’s 2020 annual report, challenges in Canada’s forest sector 
are uncertainty in global trade, changes in consumer demand, and increasing international competition. Due to such 
challenges the forest products industry needs to revise its current business strategies and policies and implement new 
models capturing new opportunities to stay competitive on the market (Vahid et al., 2014; Mobtaker, 2018). 
 
The forest products supply chain (FPSC) is defined as the processing steps starting with harvesting operations and 
ending with logistics and sales activities (Müller et al., 2019). It consists of a series of activities including forest 
harvesting and management, deployment and maintenance of the forest road network, transportation of the trees and 
logs, forest products manufacturing, and distribution of the products to customers. There is no clear boundary between 
different entities and interactions such as sharing resources, cost allocation, and risks between these independent 
agents lead to complex interdependencies. To solve such a problem, collaboration is considered as a potential approach 
to resolving difficulties arising from the interdependencies between the members involved (Azouzi & D’Amours, 
2012; Gilabert, 2014). Inter-firm collaboration in the FPSC could lead to new opportunities while achieving higher 
profit for their businesses that was not possible to achieve individually (Azouzi & D’Amours, 2012). 
 
In this research, a systematic literature review (SLR) identified how collaboration is present for the forest products 
industry. It should be noted that, in this research, references from 2010 to 2020 were considered. For this SLR, a set 
of keyword combinations relating to the forest products industry, forest supply chain, collaboration, and collaborative 
strategy were systemically searched in specific fields of selected search engines. A total of 70 articles respecting the 
search criteria were found and analyzed in order to identify the different collaboration forms and collaboration

1. Introduction 
The advancement of transportation facilities in Indonesia is actually showing a fairly rapid increase because people 
cannot be separated from the meaning of transportation as a mode of their daily activities in almost every activity. 
This introduces a number of innovative business opportunities in the world of general insurance, particularly in 
motor vehicle insurance. People are increasingly interested in insuring their vehicles. Increasingly people who 
want to insure their vehicles, attributed to the high risks that vehicle owners will face. Motorized vehicles are used 
by an increasing population to travel both within and outside of the city. 
 
Beginning with the high sales figures and the various risks of accidents that will emerge, the competition dynamics 
of insurance companies have become more intense. This is a positive trend for those involved in the four-wheel 
vehicle insurance industry, in which there are opportunities for every company to sell their products to the market, 
but it does not stop there, the opening of opportunities does not necessarily mean that the insurance industry will 
find it helpful to find customers. The global financial dynamics, trends in people's lifestyles with high mobility, 
and the presence of advanced information technology necessarily require that any insurance company be able to 
innovate in order to attract the customers. The impact of market competition appears from anywhere that will 
always be available, so each insurance company must be able to enforce various strategies to pique the interest of 
its customers, However, there are several things to consider, as Meninarti Puspaningtyas did in the Dynamic 
Journal Volume 2, No.1 in which marketing strategy not only require external factors, but also interactive internal 
marketing factors, service mastery, which is a general concept, is an interesting finding that has become 
increasingly complex in today's modern conditions.  
 
As a result, this becomes definite that the implementation of each strategy must be integrated with others, either 
within the company or outside the company. One of the ways is applying those strategies using a promotional 
mix, such as advertising, direct marketing, interactive, sales promotion, publicity, and also personal selling 
(Belch,2009). Some of these strategies are integrated with others and are supported by all company parties as well 
as other interested parties, which will certainly lead to the success of the program being carried out, which in the 
insurance industry is the best service quality for its customers. Viewed from the highest mobility of people in 
Indonesia, as well as the continued development of information technology, prospective insurance customers need 
fast and easy service. For this reason, the strategy carried out in addition to utilizing conventional methods such 
as personal selling must also be able to take advantage of information technology using digital media such as 
websites, social media, etc. that way customers retrieve the information and services without significant problem. 
The new thing is to take advantage of services using a mobile application, which is a ready-to-use program 
designed to carry out a function for other users or applications, to be used by the intended target on a mobile or

893","5.2  Strategies of PT Asuransi Astra Buana 
Strategy is a collective way of thinking (Mintzberg, 1987). Strategy is the simplification of rules and these rules 
are based on a ‘if-then’ logic (White, 2004). In the implementation a business necessitates the involvement of a 
manager as well as inter-divisional cooperation. PT Asuransi Astra Buana can implement a differentiation strategy 
as well as a cost leadership strategy. , with a variety of products and divergent services characteristics that 
distinguish it is the perspective of the customer who is most appropriate to use the product and services offered. 
They can reduce the cost of offering products and services at minimal prices. 
 
5.3 Differentiation Strategy 
Strategy of a company to find the uniqueness in the market which is their target. The product uniqueness of PT 
Asuransi Astra Buana such as : the relied product to attract potential consumers on a large scale.  To distinguish 
product variety is related to the character of a product or the experience of satisfaction (real or psychological) 
obtained from consumers. Various conveniences, flexibility, comfort and other things that are difficult for 
competitors to imitate. 
 
Asuransi Astra has developed and implemented an integra program (integrity against fraud). Fraud is seen as a 
serious risk that can impact operational, cultural and psychological aspects which will damage asuransi astra 
goodwill. This absolutely will reduce customer trust and can affect the reputation. 
 
5.4  Cost Leadership Strategy 
PT Asuransi Astra Buana must be able to meet the following requirements in order to carry out this strategy. The 
developed advanced technology, Garda Akses provides customers with the ease and speed of accessing 
information, as well as friendly and informative officers. Through the provision of a variety of information product 
and assistance service as insurance product offering services (quotation), additional expansion/policy changes 
(endorsement policy), emergency assistance (Emergency Roadside Assistance and Emergency Medical 
Assistance) and claim report. The advancement of this technology, operational costs can be reduced, allowing 
businesses to offer the best price to customers. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study explored the implementation of Porter’s Generic Strategies in PT Asuransi Buana Astra. Based on the 
analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The organization’s strategy should signify the 
competitive advantage that differentiates it from others and sustain the organization’s market position. In this case, 
companies can use one or more strategies to sell products or services. It depends on the customer profile. 
 
Furthermore, in determining the competitive advantage can employ Porter's Generic Strategies while using 
differentiation strategy if they want to compete on product quality, in order to maintain customer loyalty PT 
Asuransi Astra Buana constantly improves service quality based on customer preferences. To compete on price, 
apply a cost leadership strategy to prospects and new customers. 
 
The differentiation strategy can be implemented by producing unique products with variants that are difficult for 
their competitors to imitate. Customers will be interested in buying a unique product with high quality offered 
moreover if it’s following with a competitive price. Meanwhile, to gain competitive advantage by implementing 
cost leadership strategy, PT Asuransi Astra Buana can apply advancement technology in integrated systems that 
reduce operational cost to offer the best price for customers. 
 
Based on the Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats analysis and interview result, PT Asuransi Astra 
Buana adopted two strategies to sell its product, those strategies implemented depending on the customer target. 
differentiation strategy will be implemented to the loyal customer. whereas, cost leadership strategy will be 
implemented to compete with other competitors for taking new customers.

Abstract 
 
The competition in the FMCG sector is quite fierce because consumers are sensitive to the prices. Market for FMCG 
companies in Indonesia is pretty stable. However, as consumers have access to the information needed, they become 
more selective in choosing the right products. Companies have to develop a strategy to make goods that stand out 
from their competitors. Porter’s generic competitive strategies are one of the most widely adapted frameworks for 
business strategy formulation. In this paper, the companies’ competitive strategy was evaluated using Porter’s generic 
strategies. Then financial performance of each company is assessed, to compare the result of the applicability of 
Porter’s generic strategies. Using Indofood and Mayora as a study case, results have shown that both of the companies 
have successfully implemented Porter’s generic strategies. However, Mayora implementation of Porter’s generic 
strategies have a better positive impact to the financial performance of the company compared to Indofood.

1. Introduction  
Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) or consumer packaged goods are products that are sold at low cost and 
relatively quick. These goods include beverages, toiletries, package foods, over-the-counter medicines, candies, and 
others. FMCG goods have a high turnover (have a short shelf life) because these goods are consumed and purchased 
continuously, at a low price, and in large quantities. The competition in this industry is quite fierce because consumers 
are sensitive to the prices. 
Market for FMCG companies in Indonesia is pretty stable. However, as consumers have access to the information 
needed, they become more selective in choosing the right products. The availability of goods in the market and the 
prices are the most important aspects. Companies have to develop a strategy to make goods that stand out from their 
competitors.  
Industrial performance can be defined as a set of financial and non-financial indicators that indicate the proportion 
of goals and results that have been met. Manufacturing performance is critical to a company's success, as superior 
performance leads to increased competitiveness. Companies in the manufacturing sector must identify and evaluate 
the parameters that improve their performance, particularly those related to operational performance (Nurcahyo et al. 
2021) 
A company can outperform rivals only if it can establish a difference that it can preserve (Porter 2000). Strategy 
plays a significant role in business performance, so if an organization develops a good and clear strategy, the 
performance is likely to be better (Parnell 2010). Porter’s generic competitive strategies are one of the most widely 
adapted frameworks for business strategy formulation, so they are used in this research to analyze the performance of 
FMCG companies in Indonesia. 
Cost leadership and differentiation are the two main types of strategic choices for achieving competitive advantage 
available to firms, whereas focus strategies are only suitable for small firms targeting niche market segments. Based 
on the past research at Unilever Nigeria PLC, shows that implemented product differentiation give significant results

902","competitive strategy of the companies. Based on our analysis, Mayora has a better cost-leadership strategy compared 
to Indofood.  
 
The applicability of differentiation strategy also will give the impact to the companies’ performance. This 
strategy requires the firm to make unique products and differentiate their product from the competitor (Banker, 
Mashruwala & Tripathy 2014, cited in Bayraktar, Hancerliogullari, Cetinguc & Calisir 2016). Companies can do the 
differentiation along the value chain of the company, including research and development projects, price, design of 
the product, brand image, technology, service, distribution, dealer network, and other aspects (Lin & Chang 2015, 
cited in Bayraktar, Hancerliogullari, Cetinguc & Calisir 2016). Companies can achieve the benefit of the 
differentiation strategy when the high price of the products exceed the cost that is needed to make a unique product 
(Booth et al  2011 cited in Firoz et al. 2019). To achieve the competitive advantage, companies must develop a unique 
product that cannot be easily imitated by the competitors. 
Based on the analysis of this study, the applicability of differentiation strategies are through the design and the 
quality of the products offered by the companies. The research and development department of the FMCG companies 
need to make an extra effort to develop a new product and make an impressive product innovation for the companies.  
 
FMCG companies also used the focus strategy as their competitive strategy to compete with the competitors. 
Focus strategy is similar to the cost-leadership and differentiation. This strategy is focusing on how the FMCG 
company can gain the competitive advantage in well defined market segments (Firoz et al. 2019). Unlike the other 
strategies, focus strategy is directed to a narrow competitive scope within the FMCG industry (Porter, 1985). 
Companies achieve the competitive advantage from this strategy by deploying resources across the value chain of the 
companies to gain the maximum results. The application of the focus strategy in FMCG companies is able to minimize 
the response time to the customer product request and can also help to improve the quality of the customer service 
(Kim et al, 2004 cited in Firoz et al.  2019). 
 
To sum up, competitive advantage is a critical factor for the company that contributes to achieve a good 
companies’ financial performance. Companies need to improve and continually evaluate the generic strategy as a 
sustainable competitive advantage, throughout the value chain of the company, so they can maintain the position of 
the company in the market and fulfill the customer needs. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study investigates the applicability of Porter’s generic strategy including cost-leadership strategy, 
differentiation strategy, and focus strategy. Two FMCG companies in Indonesia were selected to be an object of this 
study. Indofood and Mayora were selected to be the objects of this study. This study compared the applicability of 
Porter’s generic strategy and see how the impact of the application of Porter’s generic strategy to the financial 
performance of the company. The findings of this study showed that Indofood and Mayora as the FMCG company in 
Indonesia has successfully implemented Porter's generic strategy. Indofood and Mayora are the two major FMCG 
companies in Indonesia. Both of these companies have gained the competitive advantage which can be seen from the 
financial performance, including ROA, ROE, profit margin and operating margin. 
Both of the companies have various types of products with the various prices that they offer to the customer. 
Indofood and Mayora always do innovation and try to develop their product so they can maintain their position in the 
market. It is also important for the FMCG company to regularly evaluate and try to improve the generic strategy along 
the value chain of the company, so they can gain a sustainable competitive advantage. According to the financial 
calculation, Mayora has the higher value in ROA, ROE, and profit margin, while Indofood has the higher value in the 
operating margin. Mayora implementation of Porter’s generic strategies have a better positive impact to the financial 
performance of the company compared to Indofood.  
However, the investigation of this study is based on the limited secondary data that the data and information were 
collected from the online source and the annual report of the companies. To get a better and more comprehensive 
analysis, future study should conduct more broad research, including the primary data and the more information 
directly from the companies, so that the data obtained can be more accurate.

Abstract  
 
In more than 100 years, the first global pandemic COVID-19 has proliferated all over the world at an unprecedented 
speed. The biopharmaceutical industry is moving fast to discovering a vaccine while governments scaling up to 
overcome the complex task of a global vaccination program. Now the race is on to organize supply chains to distribute 
billions of vaccines around the world. The logistic of the distribution vaccine requires a huge amount of people, 
transportation equipment, and storage equipment for low temperatures to handle the highly perishable vaccine. The 
process requires a just-in-time environment to get the population as fast as possible, in the right conditions for each 
one of the individuals that need to take the vaccine. This is huge shipping, transportation, and distribution challenge. 
It inspired us to reflect on the requirements of a massive COVID-19 vaccine distribution; and to contribute to the 
process improvement, adapting previous research work on lean and green supply chain modelling. Considering the 
high number of challenges, this work intends to develop a lean and green model for the healthcare supply chain. An 
overview of developing the coronavirus vaccine supply chain, identifying and systematizing recent trends, and the 
impact of COVID-19 on global supply chain management is considered. How lean and green supply chain practices 
can help in the vaccine supply chain.

1. Introduction 
The ongoing pandemic situation, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spurred severe disruptions across the 
world and in the entire supply chains (Govindan et al., 2020), especially pressing companies to reorganize the 
strategies behind their deliveries. The development and clinical release of various vaccines was the remarkable success 
story of 2020 and the distribution of these vaccines to a critical mass of people will be the challenge of 2021 (World 
Economic Forum, 2021). Vaccinations began in December 2020, and the vaccine rollout presents a huge and 
unprecedented challenge in terms of both logistics and geopolitics actions. As a logistical operation, transporting and 
distributing the vaccines quickly and efficiently to those who need them all around the world, is unprecedented in 
terms of scale, and in terms of urgency. The challenge is not just in quickly putting together a global supply chain for 
billions of vaccines but the fact that it must be stored, shipped, and transported at temperatures of minus 70 degrees 
Celsius (-94 Fahrenheit), otherwise it will go bad.  
 
As countries start to emerge from the immediate health crisis, COVID-19 highlights the need for global cooperation 
to address global challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic's overall impact has forced organizations to rethink their 
supply chains and their resilience for an uncertain future. While in the past, the discussion has focused mainly on cost 
efficiency, the recent history reveals that future supply chains will need to worry about resilience and adaptability. All 
stakeholders must urgently come together to minimize its impact on public health and further disruption to lives and 
economies all over the world. Bearing this in mind, on 24 April, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the 
COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility, a new global platform collaboration to accelerate 
development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Governments 
can benefit from a wide portfolio of COVID-19 candidate vaccines, assuring, at the same time, a greater market than 
governments can support by their own, using a range of technology platforms, which provides an insurance policy 
through economies of scale and portfolio diversification.

COVID-19 is the greatest global shock in the last decades. Responding to the COVID 19 pandemic requires global 
cooperation among international organizations, governments, and local communities. Technology solutions shared 
between governments, logistics providers, and healthcare providers are needed to reach the end of this pandemic and 
move towards the “next normal” (World Economic Forum, 2021).  Collaboration at an unprecedented level among all 
parties involved in the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is critical to success.  As we move into 
the future, it is vital to use what has been learned from recent events to prepare for the future. Our study stresses that 
to deliver vaccines, all parties involved – pharmaceutical companies, logistical partners, and governments – must work 
together to create a “cold chain” of freezers and temperature-controlled shipping methods that ensures vaccines are 
kept at a precise temperature. Both the Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines need to be kept frozen and must rely 
on the cold supply chain to get anywhere. Only wealthy countries have the resources to implement an adequately 
developed cold chain, leaving back the poorer countries and the remote parts of the world where electricity is 
unavailable or spotty to provide mechanisms to keep vaccines at low temperatures.  
 
A conceptualization between the fields of action lean and green supply chain and Covid-19 supply chain was presented 
in this study. The lean and green supply chain practices help to define the massive Covid-19 vaccine distribution. This 
contributes to the discussion of how modeling lean and green supply chain to help to get a massive vaccine 
administration.  
 
Several new research can be developed around this topic. Understand which practice is more important in the vaccine 
distribution and which has a high impact to respond faster to the vaccination need, can be the next step around this 
research.

Abstract 
 
Supply chain disruption during the Covid-19 pandemic led to the weakening of many organizations and supply chains 
globally, including the automotive industry supply chains such as the biggest automotive spare parts company in 
Indonesia. This paper aims to analyze the strategic adaptation of automotive spare parts manufacturers in Indonesia 
to maintain the Company's business continuity during Covid-19 pandemic and examine the influence of the strategy 
applied by the company on profitability. We analyze that the company is always chasing cost leadership in its strategic 
action since before and during the covid-19 pandemic. To improve financial performance during the economic crises, 
the company has employed some strategies such as market development strategy, product diversification strategy, 
operating expenses controlling, and wiser financial management.

1. Introduction 
From December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has expanded throughout China as well as other 
countries (Wu et al. 2020). Covid-19 is a global pandemic that causing an economic stop and threatening overall well-
being. Not only impact to heightened risks to healthcare works, the covid-19 pandemic, but also great impact on the 
global socio-economic such as higher employment and poorness rate, lower oil prices, education sector 
transformation, work nature shift, lower GDPs (Mofijur et al. 2021). 
 
The COVID-19 caused a great hurdle to almost all industries, including the automotive industry. According to Ivanov 
(2020), one of the most severe supply chain disruptions and weakening many organizations and supply chains globally 
is the COVID-19 pandemic. So that, it impacted automotive supply chains such as automotive spare parts companies 
(Nicola et al., 2020; Trovao, 2020). 
 
This paper focuses on the supply chain players in the Automotive Industry, that is automotive spare parts companies. 
Our study case is one of the Indonesian biggest automotive spare parts companies in Indonesia. The Company's focus 
is producing and distributing various spare parts for two-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles. It has two largest market 
segments are automotive manufacturers (OEM - Original Equipment Manufacturer) and the after-market for 
replacement parts (REM - Replacement Market) 
 
Based on GAIKINDO (2021), The automotive market in Indonesia experienced a significant decline in 2020 due to 
the pandemic. The automotive market for 4-wheeled vehicles fell 48.4% to 532,027 units from 1,030,126 units in 
2019, while the automotive market for 2-wheeled vehicles decreased by 37.8% to 4,363,408 units compared to the 
previous year which reached 7,010,529 units. Additionally, most plants and dealerships around the world are closed 
for several weeks or months so that there are no productions for operational and hygienic reasons (Kufelova and 
Rakova, 2020). This impact was felt by the Company considering the decline in demand for Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs), directly affecting the Company's overall performance. In the OEM market, companies cannot

optimum returns to shareholders, by taking into account the required future capital and the Company’s capital 
efficiency, current and future profitability, operational cash flow projection, projected capital investment and projected 
strategic investment opportunities. In order to maintain or adjust capital structure, the Company can adjust the amount 
of dividend paid to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

Abstract 
Designing and/or redesigning a proper layout of a small production line it is not an easy task to a company. Usually 
this is performed using empirical methodologies and according to space availability. Mainly due to the latter, the 
layouts are not very efficient and optimized. This case study portrays a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) in 
the electronics industry, which, taking advantage of the need to introduce a new product in the production, intends to 
redesign the layout of a production line, whose efficiency has been decreasing. To this end, three methods were applied 
- Empirical Model, Systematic Layout Planning and Lean Facility Layout System. The results prove that the Lean
Layout Facility System method achieved better results by reducing both lead time and the workers movement time
and distance.

1. Introduction
As global markets become increasingly more competitive, the uncertainties and difficulties associated with the 
development of a new product increase alongside with the pressure to keep up with the demand in product innovation 
(Gupta and Wilemon 1990). Therefore, innovation is considered critical for a company to obtain a dominant position 
in the market and to gain higher profits (Cheng et al. 2010). Time management, more specifically, the reduction of 
lead times, will result in a competitive advantage, allowing manufacturing companies to gain an edge over the creation 
and production of new products (Tersine and Hummingbird 1995). Manufacturing companies have to adapt to this 
innovation rhythm if they want to survive, and for that, the production lines for new products must be well planned 
before implemented in the shop floor. Several problems occur when this implementation is not supported by a careful 
planning and solid study, thus risking lowering the efficiency of the production lines. 
According to Kiran (2019), plant layout deals with the orderly and proper arrangement of manufacturing facilities and 
the use of available resources, including workforce, money, machines, tools, materials, and production processes. 
Depending on the production processes properties, like the production volume and products variety, the layout should 
be organized in different ways. The four main layout types are: fixed-position layout, process layout, cell layout, and 
product layout.  
Considering the existing layout types, the shop floor should be designed so that the manufacturing processes can be 
achieved in an effective and efficient manner (Åkerman 2016). 
The placement of the facilities in the plant area, often referred to as ‘‘Facility Layout Problem”, is known to have a 
significant impact upon manufacturing costs, work in progress, lead times and productivity (Drira et al. 2006). A well-
organized layout of machines or departments and a suitable transportation paths create an efficient plant (Bock and

Abstract  
 
The world we live in today evolves at a tremendous and rapid pace where everyday life and daily operations be it 
business wise or personal has moved away from the era of physically doing things. The introduction of digital and fast 
changing technology has taken over the 21st century. This calls for continuous movement with changes by 
government, industry and society if competitive participation at global level is to take place. The purpose of this study 
was to examine the impact of the introduction of the 4th Industrial Revolution and the impact that it has on the 
operations management part in the field of banking in South African. A combination of both quantitative and 
qualitative research methods were employed by the researcher to conduct the study. The results from the respondents 
indicated that the implementation of Industry 4.0 in the South African banking industry presents a significant impact 
on the industry. The results also revealed that the people most affected by the revolution were anxious about the future 
and general job security, given some retrenchments over the past few years in the industry.

1. Introduction 
The evolution of today, Industry 4.0 or 4IR as it is known by many people today, the revolution that bring many 
advantages to organizations and the world where everything is digitalized and human contact is becoming slimmer, 
this revolution brings convenience in the comfort of one’s home. With reference to banking, industry 4.0 has made 
life easier in aspects of life where people do not need to go the banks physically to do transaction, deposits, queries, 
and even stand in long unnecessary ques, it has brought convenience at the click of a finger where people are saved 
time and money. This study explores the topic of the 4th industrial revolution (hereafter termed Industry 4.0) and the 
impact that it has on the current operations management systems in the banking industry in the republic of South 
Africa. The researcher did extensive research on the topic of interest and did an in-depth study on finding out 
information about the fourth industrial revolution, what this revolution is, when this revolution started and what it 
means for the 21st century South Africa.  
 
Operations management has slowly become crucial among the success factors of financial institutions. This has 
become the case as more and more organizations have realized the importance and the important role that the 
operations manager plays in the success of any business organization, the banking industry is no exception as they 
play the role of balancing act between optimizing costs and ensuring the growth of the requirements of the business.  
Although the implementation of Industry 4.0 brings a whole lot of advantages, problems also arise as a country such 
as the Republic of South Africa is already high in unemployment. The implementation of industry 4.0 might make the 
unemployment burden even heavier not only on the country’s economy but also on the currently employed staff in the 
banking industry of South Africa with potential retrenchments, given their services may no longer be as extensively 
required due to robotics and related emerging technologies proven more reliant, more efficient, more effective, and 
accurate in the operations of moving the industry to greater heights. The aim of the study is to look at the impact of 
the fourth industrial revolution on modern operations in the banking industry.

Based on the results from Bank A, a significant 86% of respondents strongly agreed that they have fears of job losses; 
77% strongly agree that there are those not buying into the implementation of Industry 4.0, whilst 70% strongly sensed 
sceptics. It was also noted that a significant percentage of respondents had positive perceptions about the Industry 4.0 
programs. This is highlighted with a significant 81% of respondents agreeing to IT and HR transformation projects 
presenting improvement options, 70% strongly agreeing to competitive advantages with Industry 4.0 and 60% also 
strongly agreeing in both cases to benefits related to how the job is carried out as well as increased revenues. Results 
from this bank reveal similarly that while there are benefits employees are looking forward to, there are negative 
perceptions as well to be addressed by the leaders in the organisation; this indicated certain commonalities across the 
banks from which the study was undertaken 
 
Similarities were also identified in that the commonality the bank employees had was the fear of losing their jobs and 
not buying into the implementing Industry 4.0 tools. In some cases, these sentiments were received from senior 
employees who were not extensively tech equipped and driven, being inclined to old traditional ways of banking. 
 
The results from the respondents show that the implementation of Industry 4.0 in the South African banking industry 
presents a significant impact on the industry. The results also revealed that the people most affected by the revolution 
were anxious about the future and general job security, given some retrenchments over the past few years in the 
industry. According to Kahla (2019) one of the major banks announced closure of 91 of its branches partly due to 
technological transformation, which equated to significant job losses. This including other factors presented a negative 
effect on the South African economy as unemployment remained a massive issue, whereas Industry 4.0 could easily 
be perceived with uncertainties for the industry as well.  
 
4. Conclusion  
This study suggests that there is a gap worthy of consideration between the implementation of Industry 4.0 and 
employment security in the South African banking industry.  Employees’ perceptions reflected that whilst they are 
not opposing the industrial shift and are embracing the benefits of change; they mostly not ready for the full

955","implementation of Industry 4.0 which indicates gaps that need to be addressed by these institutions in terms of leading 
change management. It was also noted furthermore that retrenchment decisions that took place in some of the banks 
were perceived by respondents to be partially attributable to Industry 4.0 impact, which also resulted to negative 
perceptions about the growing phenomenon. It could be deducted that some of these perceptions reflect the grey areas 
some of the industries have with regards to whether or not employment will really be guaranteed, with digital 
advancements taking place.  The study also revealed that the majority of the younger generation did not largely have 
perceived challenges with the implementation of Industry 4.0.  
 
In overall, benefits such as increased revenues and profits, competitive advantages, process efficiencies, flexibility in 
customer responses as well as minimal impact on some of employees’ personal livelihoods were encouraging factors 
outweighing the change management concerns which banks had an opportunity to effectively address. The state of 
progress and advancements by some of the banks towards onboarding Industry 4.0 tools such as robotics process 
automation in functions such as customer support services, smart machines, intelligent networking and others were 
observed to be key strides achieved gradually.

Abstract 
 
This project is a case study developed in a real industrial context of a company in the automotive industry dedicated 
to tyre manufacturing. The high quantity of items associated with a limited production capacity in the balancing section 
leads to a significant increase in production planning activity complexity. The allocation of products to the balancing 
machines is done daily by workers who use only spreadsheets, taking a significant part of their day in a time-
consuming and complex activity. To evaluate the usage of the installed capacity of the machines and to minimise the 
setups in the equipment, a Decision Support System (DSS) based on optimisation models is developed. Having as 
input the items that need to be tested, the DSS suggests an optimal configuration of the equipment that will minimise 
the setups and guarantee that all tyres are tested, facilitating the daily routine of production planners. This article 
describes the problem, the mathematical model of linear programming that is the basis of the DSS. It presents the 
results obtained after testing the system in a real context.

1. Introduction 
 
The automobile sector plays a significant role in the global economy. The search for competitiveness advantages from 
companies in this sector leads to a continuous focus on increasing productivity and efficiency. The search for 
efficiency is particularly relevant in the tyre manufacturing industry, whose profitability depends on cost-efficient 
operations as tyres are largely considered a commodity. 
 
This project was developed in a tyre manufacturing company whose production process can be divided into five main 
stages. The process begins with the Blending of raw materials in mixers that produce a compound stored at the end of 
the stage. In the next stage, Preparation, different tyre components are manufactured to be assembled in the next stage, 
Construction. It is then followed by Vulcanisation, where the tyre acquires its final appearance and characteristics 
when vulcanised in a mould at a high temperature and pressure, specific for each tyre. Finally, the tyre goes to Final 
Inspection. A visual inspection is performed at this stage, followed by tests on uniformity machines and balancing 
machines. Balancing is a test that measures the mass distribution in the tyre. In the company, only those tyres whose 
customers request it undergo this last test. 
 
The Balancing section consists of a group of parallel balancing machines on which a rim is mounted to enable the tyre 
to be balanced during operation. Each rim allows the fitting of three different tyre sizes. Thus, each machine can test

On the second results presentation spreadsheet, the information is displayed in greater detail. For each machine, the 
rim that should be allocated to it is shown as well as the machine capacity, the load and the remaining slack after the 
allocation of the items. Knowing the advantages of visual management, the field indicating the name of the equipment 
can assume two colours: green if the rim is already on the respective machine or red if a setup is required. To let the 
user know how many changes on the machines need to be made, the field ""Total No of setups"" indicates the number 
of rim changes to do compared to the current configuration. Figure 8 shows all the previously mentioned elements. 
 
 
Figure 8. Table of Results Presentation by Machine and ""Items"" Button. 
 
Still in this spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 8, an ""Articles"" button allows the user to see which items were allocated 
to each piece of equipment. This functionality allows visualising the results of the programming model developed. 
This way, the user now has a base of items allocation to machines resulting from an algorithm that seeks an optimal 
solution. Therefore, the decision-making process in the planning of the balancing machines is simpler and better 
founded. 
 
7. Conclusion  
All things considered it can be concluded that the goal of developing a DSS that helps to evaluate the capacity of the 
balancing section was achieved. Through the developed decision support system, it is possible to assess if the 
production plan is feasible and also what changes need to be made to make it feasible. The linear programming model 
fulfills the requirement that was assigned to it. 
 
The computational testing and evaluation of the DSS by future users were performed near the end of the project, which 
led to a late identification of small gaps and prevented the improvement of some aspects. Therefore, there are some 
future works that can be taken into consideration. As far as the linear programming model is concerned, it would be 
interesting to reformulate it in order to suit better the company’s context by considering consider the distribution of 
the workload between all the machines This means that it would be necessary to add new constrains and objectives 
functions to the model that would minimise the standard deviation of the remaining capacity of the equipment, 
preventing some equipment from being down.

967","Regarding the interface of the DSS, it is possible to conclude that, although it is simple, it requires some training on 
the part of the user in order to become familiar with the structure of the program. However, this system proved to be 
helpful to workers by reducing the time spent by them on the production planning activity in 25 minutes.  
 
This project in a production context shows that decision support systems can be a very useful tool in the decision-
making process, giving the decision maker the ability to evaluate different action scenarios and act in the most 
appropriate way. The solution here presented contemplates the use of integer programming models which are the basis 
of the resolution of many optimization problems in industry.

1. Introduction 
 
Much literature considers the important role of airports and air traffic as a country's economic activity. The 
International Air Transport Association surveyed that the growth of the aviation industry is around 6.6% annually and 
has grown more than 5% from 2000 – 2010 ( Michael, 2013). Looking at the current industrial development, the 
ASEAN Airline AirAsia region is no stranger. As the best low-cost passenger, AirAsia connects visitors and 
destinations via 293 routes; 90 of them were categorized as unique routes - routes only operated by the AirAsia Group. 
In 2017, the AirAsia Group, including the AirAsia Berhad Group (Combined Airline Group of AirAsia Malaysia, 
AirAsia Indonesia, AirAsia Philippines, AirAsia Thailand, AirAsia India and AirAsia Japan), cemented its position as 
a leader in the aviation industry through two milestones: flying 435 million passengers and doubled its fleet from 
2 aircrafts in 2001 to 205 aircrafts by the end of 2017. Nonetheless, Air Asia producing high quality products at low 
prices due to competitive cost methods. The study of Air Asia cost leadership strategy, with a simple, efficient concept 
and a core competitiveness point will have a significant effect on the foundations and development of modern industries. 
 
History of Air Asia 
 
The story of AirAsia begins as an airline with two aircrafts serving six routes in Malaysia in January 2002. 
Sixteen years later, AirAsia skyrocketed to become an airline serving more than 119 destinations in 21 countries. 
Now, AirAsia has more than 20,000 employees with a market capitalization of more than RM14.6 billion or around 
IDR 52 trillion (as of February 28, 2018). As the sole airline that is Truly ASEAN, AirAsia reaches 3.3 billion people 
through 23 hubs in six countries - Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Penang, Johor Bahru, and Langkawi in 
Malaysia; Bangkok, Phuket, Chiang Mai, Krabi, U-Tapao (Pattaya), and Hat Yai in Thailand; Jakarta, Bali, Medan 
and Surabaya in Indonesia; Manila, Kalibo (Boracay), and Cebu in the Philippines; Bengaluru, Delhi and Kolkata in 
India; and Nagoya in Japan.

but Air Asia also issued the AirAsia Unlimited Pass program. AirAsia Unlimited Pass is a program for unlimited 
flights on some AirAsia networks. This program is similar with the SJ Travel Pass which was held several years ago 
from Sriwijaya Air. AirAsia has also held similar programs in several countries such as AirAsia X for long-distance 
international routes and Thai AirAsia domestic routes (pinterpoin, 2020). 
 
6. Conclusion  
AirAsia is one of the airlines using a cost leadership strategy in the ASEAN Region. As the best low-cost airline, 
AirAsia connects visitors and destinations via 293 routes; 90 and cement its position as a leader in the aviation industry 
through two milestones: flying 435 million passengers and doubling its fleet from 2 aircraft in 2001 to 205 aircraft by 
the end of 2017. AirAsia implements  key strategies to achieve this, such as: high aircraft utilization, low fares, no 
frills 
and a direct flight network.  To cover losses during the Covid 19 pandemic, AirAsia opened a new business unit, 
namely online motorcycle taxis. Air Asia has two core competitiveness points: it has lower fares compared to other 
airlines and has auto baggage facilities to make it easier for passengers without having to queue long. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, Air Asia has issued the AirAsia Unlimited Pass program. AirAsia Unlimited Pass is a program 
for unlimited flights on some AirAsia networks.

Abstract 
 
The global economy has been greatly impacted by Covid-19. As a result, McDonald's devised a plan to form a 
partnership with BTS and make a collaborative product that is BTS Meal. The strategy used by McDonald's is market 
development. The purpose of this study is to learn about the most important aspects of active social media engagement 
among followers of a food and beverage sales organization, as well as the impact of social media engagement rate on 
new product sales. The research provides empirical evidence that highly engaged social media posts boost firm 
performance by increasing sales. Furthermore, the study provides a formula for success by utilizing text mining 
strategies to determine the most effective use of social media channels. Data collection was carried out by conducting 
literature studies, observations through McDonald's Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok, data analysis, and a calculation 
of the engagement rate. The BTS Meal, that will be available in 49 countries, will offer a McDonald's menu and 
signature dipping sauce inspired by McDonald's South Korean sauces. This research is expected to show how the 
exposure generated from the high engagement rate can be used as an impact on McDonald's sales and brand in the 
future.

1. Introduction 
A public health emergency of unprecedented proportions erupted at the end of December 2019. Covid-19 is rapidly 
spreading around the world, causing massive damage and loss of life while still having a significant impact. Covid-
19, the most transformative non-financial risk of this decade, precipitated the Great Non-Financial Risk Crisis. This 
pandemic has an impact on large chain companies, including the food industry, specifically McDonald's. McDonald's 
Corporation is an American fastfood corporation founded in 1940 as a restaurant in San Bernardino, California, by 
Richard and Maurice McDonald. Many McDonald's outlets were closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the 
McDonald's Kuta Beach, Indonesia which was closed starting September 29, 2020. McDonald's also suspended its 
restaurant services in America on March 16, 2020, and closed all outlets in Ireland on March 23, 2020. As a result, 
the integration of strategy and risk management is crucial. The Covid-19 pandemic is a significant challenge that 
requires the food industry system, including McDonald's, to evolve and adapt. 
 
In this situation, Porter believes that businesses must select one of three strategies as their dominant strategy in order 
to achieve market leadership. The strategic strategy includes the cost leadership strategy, differentiation strategy, and 
focus strategy (Porter, 2011). Restaurants that are highly competitive and undifferentiated, such as McDonald's, use a 
cost leadership strategy (Cotterill, 1993) and (Ma, 2021). To survive the Covid-19 pandemic, McDonald's employs an 
intensive strategy (market development). The market development strategy focuses on entering new markets while 
continuing to use existing products (Sari & Inggriantara, 2020). By collaborating with influencers, McDonald's can 
gain the exposure that comes with a high level of engagement, which can have a positive impact on McDonald's sales 
and market in the future. McDonald's has previously had successful collaborations with musicians such as Travis Scott

6. Conclusion 
This study only focuses on case studies of McDonald's BTS Meal products' social media impact. According to the 
findings of this study, McDonald's market development strategy, namely BTS Meal via social media posts, has a 
significant impact on the company's marketing performance, as evidenced by a high level of engagement. Social media 
marketing and developing the right strategy are critical for a company's success. According to the findings of this 
study, social media content and an increasing number of followers indicate strong consumer engagement on social 
media, making it easier for McDonald's to market its products. Due to limited data and time types, this paper did not 
conduct an in-depth discussion of the benefits of this BTS Meal sales strategy. However, in the future, the researchers 
will conduct a comprehensive data analysis on the profit from selling BTS Meal.

Abstract 
 
This research paper has the main objective to study a generic strategy proposed by Porter. In addition, outlining the 
advantages and disadvantages of each of these strategies for the company. The analysis for the application of the 
strategy was carried out in the food industry sector, namely Shake Shack, Inc. The study was conducted based on 
secondary data obtained from articles, journals, research reports and company websites. Based on the results of the 
study, it was found that the Shake Shack implementation differentiation strategy rather than cost leadership and focus 
strategy. However, with the covid-19 pandemic this strategy will affect the sales results of the Shake Shack in 2020. 
Therefore, an increase in the cost leadership strategy needs to be considered as a shake shack strategy in the future.

1. Introduction 
In December 2019, the world was shocked by the phenomenon of a new outbreak called Covid-19 which started in 
Wuhan, China. Covid-19 rapidly spread to most countries around the world and on March 11, it has been declared a 
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2020). Many countries have implemented full or partial 
lockdown to reduce the rapid transmission of the virus. This policy has created massive impact on various industrial 
sectors in the world. One of them is the food industry. 
Food industry is considered part of a nation’s critical infrastructure along with healthcare, energy and 
communication sector. Therefore, normal operation should be maintained to feed the people during the pandemic 
(CISA, 2020). One of the companies in the food industry sector is Shake Shack. 
As one of the fastest-growing food-chains, Shake Shack has its own strategy to maintain its success during this 
pandemic time. According to its 2019 annual report, it made significant investment in its digital platform; its kiosks, 
its app, its online ordering platform, and its third-party delivery partnerships. In 2020, these investments have been 
the reason it has been able to keep so many restaurants open.  Investing in technologies includes in the cost leadership 
strategy in order to grow the business and keep it running (Stankevičiūtė et al., 2012). 
Therefore, this study will take Shake Shack as an example to explore the competitive strategy. At the same time, 
the Covid-19 pandemic has brought great harm to all companies during 2020. Under such circumstances, whether the 
current strategy of enterprises can affect current strategy is also the focus of this paper. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes literature review about strategy and the effect 
of generic strategy on Firm Performance will be discussed. Section 3 presents the objective of this study. Then, Section 
4 gives the method to carry out this study. Analysis and discussion will be given in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 will 
summarize all the finding that is given in this study. 
 
1.1. Objectives of the Study 
1. To identify business strategy adopted by Shake Shack 
2. To assess internal and external business aspect of Shake Shack

985","By the end of fiscal year 2020, Shake Shack reported that total revenue and system-wide sales has been 
decreased 12.1% to $523 million and 13% to $779 million respectively compared to last year number (Figure 4). 
Covid-19 pandemic also take its toll on the operating cost of Shake Shack with the loss of $43.9 million compared 
to last fiscal year which saw operating profit of $25.7 million. This largely, due to reduction in sales caused by the 
pandemic all year long which saw many Shacks to be temporarily closed or open with certain restrictions and also 
due to upward trend of food delivery which saw increased of delivery commission and packaging cost. 
 
 
Figure 4. Comparison of Total Revenue and System Wide Sales 
 
4.5. Recommendation 
Since dining experience is one of the most deciding factor for almost all fast food or casual dining restaurant, 
accommodating open space dining experience might be helping to get around various restriction during pandemic. 
If not possible, to stay competitive during the pandemic, Shake Shack and other fast food restaurants needs to more 
embrace operating with minimum contact. Then, it needs to accommodate it into their cost strategy to avoid any 
increased in their operational cost. This can be reached by utilizing creative idea on their digital platform to keep it 
user friendly thus creating easy ordering experience for customer and while keep pushing through plan for creating 
drive thru experience. This also can be proved as a useful investment to prepare the competition after the pandemic 
end. Adopting a hybrid strategy with cost leadership and differentiation can improved Shake Shack’s performance 
compared to just chasing one competitive strategy. By adopting dual strategy, it can create sustainable advantage and 
create cost synergy at the same time (Heracleous and Wirtz, 2009). Furthermore, we recommend Shake Shack to 
more embrace cost leadership strategy to create sustainable operation by controlling their overhead expenses and try 
to source more supplier with tight quality management system to still give the best guest’s experience. 
 
5. Research Finding and Conclusion 
After analyzing the strategies applied by Shake Shack and reviewing the previous regulations, it can be concluded 
that the strategies used have an effect on the ongoing activities of a company, especially when calculating the profit. 
In addition, Shake Shack need to consider the internal and external business aspects of the company. With the 
existence of strengths and opportunities, it is expected that the company can increase the growth and broad market, 
and with weaknesses and threats, it is hoped that the company will pay more attention and improve the things that 
exist in this section. The strategy implemented by Shake Shack at this time focuses more on differentiation strategy. 
This can be seen by the company's commitment to using premium ingredients for their products, having a unique 
culture with the “We Stand for Something Good” and “Enlightened Hospitality”, and also conducting campaigns 
discounts and promotions by partnering with other established platforms such as ""Coachella"". and ""Uber"" to gain 
market share.  
In 2015-2019 this strategy created great success for Shake Shack, it can be seen from Figure 1. (Increased 
Total Revenue of Shake Shack 2015–2019) total revenue increased from year to year and broke the record in 2019 
by opening 39 internationally licensed Shacks and getting revenue was $ 595 million, an increase of 29.4% from a

990","year earlier. However, following the pandemic and the government requiring “stay at home” it had such a significant 
impact on Shacks that in April they had to close 61 of the 120 licensed Shacks. In addition, the impact of Covid-19 
forced Shake Shack to lay off or revoke around 20% of its staff in early 2020. It can be seen in Table 2. (Sales 
Recovery during Fiscal Year 2020) reports that total revenue and sales throughout the system have decreased.  
Therefore, it is necessary to update the strategy implemented by the shake shack to overcome losses caused 
by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. From the results of the above discussion, it was suggested that the shake 
shack should use a hybrid strategy by combining cost leadership and differentiation strategy in order to improve the 
performance of the Shake Shack during this pandemic, in order to create sustainable benefits and create cost synergy 
at the same time.

Abstract 
 
Coffee shops have been defined as ‘third places’ in urban lives, accommodating areas for people to gather, relax and 
gain connections. The expanding presence of coffee shops in Jakarta has meant that they increasingly take on a more 
comprehensive range of roles, catering spaces of sociality. People can strengthen connections and potentially create 
communities. However, the coffee shop business is facing challenging competition to persevere in COVID-19 
pandemic times. Not only because of the physical distancing applied but also because of a more significant number 
of competitors, hence declining their performance. This study aims to develop a more innovative and competitive 
business model that enhances the crucial elements of the coffee shop model canvas to strengthen their business 
performance and achieve sustainable competitive advantage by applying the SWOT analysis method. The study 
findings a proposed business model canvas serves as supporting strategies for market scheme development.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has limited many human activities, including the buying and selling process. It makes many 
companies experience a decline in sales and even go bankrupt. This paper takes the example of a baby product 
company to explore the impact of competitive strategies on sales volume in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based 
on the analysis, the baby product company's sales volume has decreased, but not significantly. The company is still 
able to survive with the cost leadership strategy implemented. This research paper aims to study the cost leadership 
strategy and analyze the benefits of adopting such strategies on baby product companies. In addition, this paper also 
provides views on how companies must respond to crises such as COVID-19 to survive.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia is the country with the fourth-largest population globally, with 270,20 million people; according to 
Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia (2020), the average number of maternal/postpartum in Indonesia is 148.548 annually. 
Data presented from Central Statistics Indonesia also shows that the total birth rate is 2.45 children per family in early 
2020. According to United Nations - World Population Prospects (2021) The current birth rate for Indonesia in 2021 
is 17.372 births per 1000 people, a 1.58% decline from 2020. The birth rate for Indonesia in 2020 was 17.650 births 
per 1000 people, a 1.55% decline from 2019. The birth rate for Indonesia in 2019 was 17.927 births per 1000 people, 
a 1.53% decline from 2018. The birth rate for Indonesia in 2018 was 18.205 births per 1000 people, a 2.03% decline 
from 2017. Along with developing people's needs and lifestyles, companies continue to innovate and evolve their 
products to meet people’s demand. This also affects baby products companies, in return, will give changes in baby’s 
needs, such as eatery equipment, toiletries, and baby food. According to Euromonitor International (2020), from the 
period of 2014 to 2018, the retail sales of baby and maternity products increased by 8% annually. This marks a 
purchase power increase for the coming years.  
Being a company that delivers common products to customers, this baby company has many competitors. Also 
with such market opportunity in baby products, companies must find ways to be able to gain competitive advantage 
from other players. To achieve a competitive advantage, this company must differentiate itself from competitors 
through the lowest price offered or best value offered. From the characteristics above and in addition to baby products 
being price-sensitive, this company implements cost leadership-best value to give the lowest price with the best value 
offered, considering how delicate and important quality is to the target market. 
A successful brand offers products that gain sustainable unique added values which fulfil customer’s needs (De 
Chernatony, 1989). By nature, customers have considerations on risks. Price, performance, perceived quality and 
value for money influence this degree of risk. Customers tend to reduce risk in their decision making process, this is 
no exception when choosing products. Well-known and familiar brands are perceived to the customers as a means to 
reduce risks (De Chernatony, 1998). This is seen as customers might consider quality more than price on several 
occasions. Risk consideration is important in any condition, especially on rough times, such as COVID-19 pandemic. 
Amid the development of baby product innovation, COVID-19 disrupts business stability. COVID-19 is one of 
the foremost severe pandemic within the last 100 years, it's affected almost the whole world in unprecedented ways. 
COVID-19 affects the transportation, tourism, trade, health and other sectors worldwide (Susilawati et al., 2020). This

996","To achieve this competitive advantage over its competitors, this company develops its own logistics company 
that makes its efficiency and effectiveness in delivery of its products remain stable even in a pandemic situation. If 
the delivery performance is terrible and repeatedly occurs, then the distributors likely terminate contracts. However, 
if the delivery performance tends to be good, it could increase its business performance to be better developed. (R.  
Nurcahyo,  and  A.  D.  Wibowo 2015). With the existence of an own logistics company, the quality of delivery will 
improve. In the end, the delivery implied a positive effect on manufacturing performance. (R.  Nurcahyo,  and  A.  D.  
Wibowo 2015). This company also aims their sales scope to far too remote cities in eastern Indonesia. Better safety 
and protection, also more control of the product supply chain all the way to the customers are fine benefits that make 
the creation of a transportation subsidiary highly worthwhile. 
Another strategy this baby company might add to gain competitive advantages is to reevaluate their marketing 
strategy. A great marketing strategy is useful to amplify their power to gain more customers (Mathutra and Latha 
2016). During COVID-19, the competition is getting tighter because of minimum visits to this baby company’s 
distribution channel. In addition to expanding a supply chain logistic fleet, this company must make ways on other 
channels by taking advantage of the internet, building partnerships, and implementing sustainable marketing strategies 
in the future.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the analysis above, the baby product company's sales volume has decreased in 2020 and 2021 compared 
to 2019, but it is not significant. The cost leadership strategy pursued by baby products companies can survive the era 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. One interesting thing is that baby product companies experienced a positive impact from 
panic buying during the January to March 2020 period. In that period, baby product companies experienced an increase 
in sales compared to 2019 and 2021. 
This company implements the cost leadership strategy-best value to give the lowest price with the best value 
offered. The focus of the cost leadership strategy should be to optimize the cost structure and reduce the cost, rather 
than blindly reduce the product price. Enterprises with the same strategy will inevitably lead to a price war. Suppose 
the enterprise takes the lead in reducing the price to a minimum value, and the current cost is not enough to support 
the continued reduction of the price. In that case, it will lead to malicious bidding by competitors and put the enterprise 
at a competitive disadvantage. At the same time, to optimize the cost structure, enterprises should also have unique 
management methods that are not quickly imitated by competitors, such as making subsidiaries in logistics. With a 
subsidiary in the logistics sector, the company was able to reduce costs and increase sales volume. The company is 
flexible in sending anywhere and anytime at a more affordable cost. 
A baby product company with a cost leadership-best value strategy is one example of a company that can 
withstand sudden attacks by COVID-19. Thousands of companies around the world have gone bankrupt due to 
COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak is likely to cause bankruptcy for many well-known brands in many industries 
as consumers stay at home and economies are shut down (Tucker 2020). In the US, famous companies such as Sears, 
JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Hertz, and J. Crew are under enormous financial pressure. The travel industry is deeply 
affected; 80% of hotel rooms are empty (Asmelash and Cooper 2020), airlines cut their workforce by 90%, and tourism 
destinations are likely to see no profits in 2020. 
The era of the COVID-19 pandemic provides lessons for all companies, including baby product companies, to 
always be ready to face various challenges. Various strategic plans must be prepared to face other challenges in the 
future, including marketing strategy. Due to time constraints, this study has not explored different strategies and has 
not used data other than sales volume. In further research, research can be using other strategies such as differentiation 
strategy, focus strategy, or different strategies, and the study must use more data to be considered.

1. Research background 
1.1 The booming of e-commerce  
Nowadays, many economists and experts believe that in recent years, the world has entered the information age after 
undergoing a revolution equivalent to the industrial revolution. (Shahriari et al., 2015). With the advent of e-
Commerce, many people in the world can compete in global markets regardless of language and cultural barriers, and 
physical distance. In addition, to adapt to changing corporate contexts, transaction processes might be reengineered. 
(Raman, 2000). E-commerce is the necessity of international business, vice versa, international business boosts e-
commerce (Zheng et al., 2009). This strong relationship demonstrates e-increasing commerce's significance in the 
global economy. 
 
Figure 1: Asisa Pacific B2B e-commerce market size (Source: www.grandviewresearch.com) 
 
According to Grand View Research, “the global B2B e-commerce market size was valued at USD 6.69 trillion in 2020 
and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5% from 2020 to 2027”. The growing 
importance of faster browsing has led to the development in connectivity, thus leading to the growth in 4G and 5G

new firms, customers, and types of products (oecd.org, 2020). For example, consumers spent $861.12 billion online with 
U.S. retailers in 2020, up 44.0% from $598.02 billion in 2019, according to the latest digitalcommerce360.com (2021).

Abstract 
 
This paper aims to provide the study of a design strategy for 3D printing production process, given its recent 
development, as well as that of high-performance materials. In particular, we focus on the blade of a wind generator 
by evaluating new construction methods deriving from new design approaches. The strategies used for the present 
study are described as follows: firstly, it was necessary to proceed to redesign the blade, by CAD software in order to 
menage a 3D model for the study and to initialize the whole project; then, the FEM analysis to validate the study. 
Finally, the AM (Additive Manufacturing) theorization and simulation for both a scaled blade and a full-sized one. 
The motivation behind this paper draws on the predominance and the constant evolution of the 3D printing in recent 
years, as well as the continuous research on both development and improvement of costs and performance of 
composite materials used.

1. Introduction  
 
This study aims to develop a Design for Additive Manufacturing method in order to provide a guideline for further 
more specific studies. More in detail, a blade of a wind generator will be analysed, redesigned, and tested to be 3D 
printing compliant through Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) methods; in the end, its practical realisation will be 
hypothesised. Firstly, the methods nowadays used in three-dimensional printing will be included, thus highlighting 
the strengths and weaknesses of each of them. Investigations upon materials currently in use on wind turbines will be 
carried out. Subsequently, the geometry of the wind turbine will be considered, drawing it as faithful as possible to 
the original; then, changes will be made with all appropriate load cases to provide for the criticalities due to three-
dimensional printing. The setting and use of tools such as the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) will then define the 
conditions of use of the wind generator. At that point, some hypothesis about the realization of the scale model will 
be presented, evaluating the printer's volume first and after the positioning, timing, and quantity of the material used 
as well as any supporting fillings. 
 
The paper aims to highlight the possible strategies to maintain a high quality standard and reduce the costs of such a 
technology at the same time. Indeed, this case study aspires to give contribution to a general improvement of 3D 
printing not only in the renewable energy field but also in any possible industry and in some other field as the 
biomedical where the surgical simulation is raising and improving (Frizziero et al, 2019, 1317 - Frizziero et al, 2020, 
5181).

1018","The combination of translation and rotation movements is demanded for two reasons. The first is to allow the extruder 
to always work perpendicular to the surface on which it deposits the material, while the second lies in the need to 
intersect carbon fibers at 90° to compensate for the material anisotropy. In addition, the present method should 
guarantee the best possible surface finish, given the working conditions of the extruder. The second advantage is that 
the final welding would no longer be necessary. Indeed, the two parts of a wind turbine are currently made by molding 
two half-shells later glued together (Figure 6), which usually constitutes the weak point of the structure in the long 
run. Instead, the method described in this study would propose the realization of a blade as a single structure, thus 
avoiding any gluing process.

5. Conclusion 
 
The present study had the purpose to outline a methodology for a 3D printing system for complex structured objects 
using a wind turbine as the case study. More in detail, the selected guideline to redesign the blade was acquired from 
Neto et al. (2018), so that its geometry resulted similar to the one in the reference study. In these terms, FEM led to 
the creation of a stress-simulation model on the component in line with those presented in literature. As a consequence, 
the method allowed the calculation of the most relevant values for the current project, i.e. bending, material tension, 
and buckling. Instead, deformations were not quantitatively significant, probably due to the preliminary nature of the 
study. At a later stage, the printing simulation of a 1:20 scale model demonstrated the project's feasibility, given the 
short printing time and the affordable cost. On the other hand, the theorizing of a full-size blade printing still deserves 
a more in-depth study for a complete validation. 
 
Generally, the study proved to be valid as the data correspond to expectations and overall trends in the field of wind 
turbines. Furthermore, the method proposed could give some basis to further research on 3D printing's technological 
development through Design for Additive Manufacturing, in any scientific sector. Indeed, the method is already 
employed in the creation of more complex objects optimized for 3D printing in an effective way.

ABSTRACT 
Titanium is an abundant resource on earth and the issue with extracting it from the ground is that the processes are 
expensive. For additive manufacturing Titanium powder needs to be reused and one of the processes of reconditioning 
of titanium powder is spheroidizing. The review also included understanding how value chain analysis has been 
conducted in South Africa in the past five years for bench marking purposes. The literature review analyses how far 
research has gone in terms of value chain analysis for spheroidisation process. Similar research papers have been 
analyzed from the past for bench marking purposes.

INTRODUCTION 
Titanium is an abundant resource, but the issue is that the processing of the metal is expensive, especially in the 
additive manufacturing industry. Titanium has a high strength to weight ratio and is suited for aircraft and automotive 
industry however it is costly to extract from the ground and must be used with caution.  For additive manufacturing, 
titanium powder needs to be reused, and one process of reconditioning of titanium powder is plasma spheroidisation. 
Reconditioning titanium minimizes the need to extract titanium thus reducing costs and saves the environment. The 
paper reviews various techniques used to obtained spherical powders and evaluate how they contribute to the value 
chain of additive manufacturing. Literature available covers the value chain from extraction of titanium to the printing 
of the titanium product. Studies that focus on the technique used to obtain spherical titanium powder needs to be done 
as it can improve the value chain of additive manufacturing and currently literature is limited on spheroidisation value 
chain studies. The review highlighted the various powder treatment techniques reviewed their strengths and 
weaknesses through a systematic review. The study also seeks to identify the gaps in spheroidisation that can help in 
the development of the spheroidisation process. 
 
Literature available covers the value chain from extraction to the final titanium product. There is need to cover the 
research gaps in the spheroidisation of the Ti6Al4V and a literature review will help identify the gaps. Since there are 
few publications that focus on spheroidisation of titanium, the research was broadened to covered spheroidisation of 
other materials as there would be little data to analyze and evaluate. Similar research needs to be studied to give build 
a bases in which the research can start. A systematic literature review was done to identify the extent to which the

1028","Literature available covers the value chain from extraction to the final titanium product. Titanium starts off as ore 
which can be either FeTiO3 ilmenite or rutile TiO2. From the ore mining the titanium should then be removed from 
the ore through beneficiation. This process serves to remove iron from the ilmenite. Slag is formed from the smelting 
which is 80-90% TiO2 (El-Sadek et al., 2019). Through further purification rutile is produced which is 92 -95% TiO2. 
Purity of the product depends on the specifications of the required product. After producing rutile from the 
beneficiation the fluidized bed chlorination process follows (Fan et al., 2017). The Kroll process is another process 
that titanium goes through before final processing. From literature, many of the processes from the extraction of the 
ore to the processing of the metal have had value chain analysis done on them and much research covers extraction 
extensively (Fang et al., 2018). In additive manufacturing there is still a long way to go particularly in the processing 
of the metal powder. Atomization and plasma spheroidisation are the two processes available for metal powder 
processing. The research will focus mainly on spheroidisation which is a reconditioning technique applied at Necsa. 
Figure 7 shows the lifecycle of titanium from extraction to end-user but with spheroidisation in the mix. Figure 7 
mainly refers to the titanium powder. 
 
Little has been done on the viability of Ti6Al4V reconditioning and a complete value chain analysis is necessary 
because titanium is highly expensive, so every process must be evaluated for sustainability and techniques to make 
the process profitable need to be developed. The value chain for the reconditioning of titanium in South Africa is still 
under developed and steps need to be taken to develop it. Many of the studies available discuss atomization of metals 
which most of the powders produced after atomization still needs to be spheroidised. The spheroidisation process 
needs to be included in the life cycle of titanium metal and other metals in general especially with regards to additive 
manufacturing. The economic benefits of reconditioning metal are not yet documented and still need to be documented 
and published. 
 
Atomization is usually the first step before spheroidisation. Atomization in many cases does not produce spherical 
powders and thus need additional processing. The various techniques to make powder are gas atomization, water 
atomization, plasma atomization and rotation cathode atomization. If the atomization produces spherical powders the 
need for spheroidisation is minimal and if the quality of the powder is not high there is little need for spheroidisation. 
However, in many applications of additive manufacturing, the materials are expensive and the applications are usually 
customized parts which require precision, thus most powders need to be high standard. The qualities that are important 
are morphology, powder density, particle size, flowability and chemical composition. In addition to refining powder 
from atomization process the spheroidisation can be used to recondition used powder from. This can bring about 
economic benefits of which many publications do not discuss in detail. More publications need to highlight in detail 
the economic benefits of spheroidisation in relation to reconditioning.

Conclusion 
There is little literature that covers the value chain for spheroidisation and industry in general. A gap has been 
identified in the value chain in South Africa for titanium especially for titanium spheroidisation. From this research, 
value chain analysis needs to be done more thoroughly and systematically particularly in spheroidisation of titanium. 
There is also need to do an economic viability of the spheroidisation of Ti6Al4V. The study should have the goal of 
finding out if the spheroidisation is profitable and sustainable.

Abstract 
 
Business strategy can be seen from the way an organization manages a sustainable business and puts forward 
something competitive in certain fields. In a pandemic like this time, many things that can harm can happen, especially 
for the sustainability of companies. Indonesia as a country that has many islands will certainly be a calculation by 
most entrepreneurs, especially in their logistics area. This study aims to determine the industrial strategy in 
overcoming the downward trend in the market with several solutions in various countries and industries, especially 
the automotive industry in Indonesia, which have an important role. At the time of the Covid-19 pandemic, this kind 
of tool must be prepared in order to survive for industry and other businesses. In this paper, a case study on the 
Indonesian government's decision to purchase automobiles without tax in Indonesia is investigated. Data collection 
was carried out from quantitative data and secondary data from several papers related to wholesales and production. 
The impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the Indonesian automotive industry which has shown a drastic pattern of 
decline in the market since early 2020 and the influence of Indonesian government policies on the automotive 
manufacturing sector will be described. From previous research, several companies implemented a cost leadership 
strategy to maintain the market strategy of Kotler, P. (1999). In this paper, the data are analyzed using secondary data 
and employing three competitive strategies porter leading to a cost leadership strategy to maintain the market and its 
existence in order to achieve the desired target by reducing costs, increasing virtual-based sales, providing discounts 
based on market segments and based on resources value. This is possible to help organizations carry out their processes 
well and create sustainable value in the Covid-19 situation.

1. Introduction  
Tracking via RFID technology allows enormous portals on a large platform of applications, and Damping in a multitude 
of engineering applications has a variable threshold requirement based on system excitation. Since system excitation is 
also variable, dampers are such that an adequate amount of damping is provided, opposed to an optimal amount as a 
function of excitation. In that context, our proposed Applicative scenario is an Intelligent Transportation application, 
combining both complementary technologies, including a complex network of variable suspension sensors and 
actuators, RFID Tags and readers, along with the main suspension ECU.  The adaptive suspension system’s purpose is 
to regulate the transportation’s vehicle suspension levels, depending on the nature of transported items, making each 
product’s trip optimally specified on security and road comfort levels, to insure the desirable transport conditions for 
sensible products. While the RFID role is to automatically, detect the optimally adequate suspension mode, based on 
already-scripted data printed on the transported items tags. 
 
In this paper, we start by defining the concept of variable suspension on both mechanical and electronic basis, while 
explaining the system’s role in optimizing transportation experiences. Secondly, we explain the system’s synoptic and 
define network’s components, functioning schematization, implantation and realization steps & we eventually underline 
RFID automated identification role in optimizing the Transportation Process.   
 
2. History & Evolution of Suspension Systems  
The first suspension system has been designed for the light chariots of RamsesbI1 around the year of 1296 B.C. But 
this suspension system was not accurate, due to its unstable condition.  At that time, one suspension system has been 
found that was practically comfortable for driving power and suspension. However, there were problems for that 
design in which it reduces the speeds and the rapid wear of the component and needs to be changed frequently.  By 
that time, the history witnessed a rapid evolution of suspension system design with several problems that have been 
discovered and identified. Regardless of the positive development of suspension system design, there still problems 
pertaining to the system such as noisy attempts at an iron chain suspension.  A new suspension system design was 
found by William Brush in 1906, after his brother had a car accident at unpaved road with the speed of 30 mph.

1041","6. Damping law for different driving inputs 
6.1. Damping law for lateral driver inputs (cornering) 
For positive lateral driver inputs, The system must make for limit the car body roll angle and velocity between Arr_mini 
and Arr_maxi (for the roll angle) and between Vrr_mini and Vrr_maxi (for the roll velocity). These values depend of 
the vehicle speed. The system must make for limit the car body roll angle and velocity with a damping factor between 
Tx_roulis_cond_mini and Tx_roulis_cond_maxi. These values depend of the vehicle speed. 
For negative lateral driver inputs, The system must make for limit the car body roll angle and velocity between Arr_mini 
and Arr_maxi (for the roll angle) and between Vrr_mini and Vrr_maxi (for the roll velocity). These values depend of 
the vehicle speed. The system must make for limit the car body roll angle and velocity with a damping factor between 
Tx_roulis_cond_mini and Tx_roulis_cond_maxi. These values depend of the vehicle speed.  
6.2. Damping law for longitudinal driver inputs (braking/acceleration) 
Braking and acceleration need different calibrations to guaranty independent damping law in function of the 
longitudinal driver inputs. Supplier will precise his functional architecture and if there is independent modules. For 
positive longitudinal driver inputs (acceleration), the system must make for limit the car body pitch angle and velocity 
between A_tg_mini and A_tg_maxi (for the roll angle) and between V_tg_mini and V_tg_maxi (for the roll velocity). 
These values depend of the vehicle speed. The system must make for limit the car body roll angle and velocity with a 
damping factor between Tx_tg_cond_mini and Tx_tg_cond_maxi. These values depend of the vehicle speed.  
For negative longitudinal driver inputs (braking, gear change), the system must make for limit the car body pitch angle 
and velocity between A_tg_mini and A_tg_maxi (for the roll angle) and between V_tg_mini and V_tg_maxi (for the 
roll velocity). These values depend of the vehicle speed. For automatic gearbox, the gear change is managed 
automatically (no clutch pedal, automatic hydraulic clutch decoupling) The system must make for limit the car body 
roll angle and velocity with a damping factor between Tx_tg_cond_mini and Tx_tg_cond_maxi. These values depend 
of the vehicle speed. 
Based on the RFID reader’s entry data, the conductor’s choice of modes, and sensor’s entry data, the system proposes 
3 different transportation modes,  
• 
State 1 – “Comfort” When this state is selected by the driver the parameters in the different functions are chosen 
to optimize the passengers comfort. These parameters will be defined during the tuning period.  
• 
State 2 – “Nominal” When this state is selected by the driver the parameters in the different functions are chosen 
to optimize the compromise between comfort and handling. These parameters will be defined during the tuning 
period.  
• 
State 3 – “Dynamic” When this state is selected by the driver the parameters in the different functions are 
chosen to optimize the handling. These parameters will be defined during the tuning period. When the mode is 
active, and when vehicle speed goes over V_Overboost_TH threshold for first time, the nominal values of 
damping forces are amplified. The amplification will be realized by applying an overboost on the nominal 
current of dynamic mode during a period T1 seconds, and will be gradually decreased during a period T2 
seconds until overboost is null again. V_Overboost_TH , amplification, duration T1 and T2 will be tuneable. 
They will be defined during the tuning period. 
Conclusion  
In this research, we showed how controlled suspension system with variable damping makes it possible to adapt the 
law of damping of the anticipated vehicle, to contain the movements of the vehicle according to the obstacles of the 
road, detected by the multifunction video camera. The integration of RFID technologies allowed automated adaptation 
of the transportation modes, depending on the precision scripted on transported items tags. This integration insured 
better transportation quality for delicate products, while reducing human intervention in the mode choice, as modes 
are automatically activated for each specific merchandise, making the transportation process independently intelligent, 
and optimizing the existing solutions.

Abstract 
 
This paper is interested in the process of choosing the most suitable Knowledge Management (KM) strategy 
for a company. Literature review presents several models and tools that can help companies manage their 
knowledge. However, any KM initiative should be part of a KM strategy that best meets the business need. 
Hansen, Nohria and Tierney previously addressed this topic by comparing the two strategies: codification 
and personalization. In order to help companies, choose the most appropriate strategy, they proposed to 
address three central questions. The answers to these questions should guide the choice of decision makers.  
Our study follows up on this work and proposes to help decision makers with a rational method. Our method 
is based on Hansen's three questions and on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tools. This method 
evaluates codification and personalization strategies in view of six criteria relating to the environment and 
the company's business. The originality of this study is the use of a mathematical tool to rationalize Hansen's 
selection aid method, which is one of the most cited works in the KM literature.

1. Introduction 
In a globalized and increasingly competitive economic environment, companies must frequently adjust and restructure 
to survive and grow. Knowledge management no longer needs to demonstrate its role as a real performance and 
sustainability lever for companies. Successful knowledge management (KM) can support businesses in obtaining 
sustainable competitive advantage (Bibi et al. 2020; Büyüközkan et al. 2016; Zaim et al. 2019). Knowledge is the 
“accumulated structure of ideas, theories, experiences and practices that provide individuals, organizations and society 
with understanding or meaning to them and their environment” (Alcorta et al. 2009). Organizational knowledge is 
frequently discussed in literature as a mechanism for capturing and disseminating the knowledge that exists within the 
organization (Huang 2013). It represents the ability of members of an organization to integrate individual knowledge 
into a collective creation process (Tsoukas and Vladimirou 2001). 
 
Heisig reviewed 160 frameworks and summarized the knowledge management process in five common activities 
which guide the development and the construction of effective knowledge management systems: identification, 
creation, storage, sharing and application (Heisig 2009). On the other hand, Nonaka, who is among the biggest 
contributors in the field of KM, distinguished two kinds of knowledge: tacit knowledge that refers to knowledge that 
resides in human mind, behavior, experience, expertise and perception; and explicit knowledge that can be readily 
articulated, codified, stored and accessed on manuals, documents, procedures, videos, etc (Nonaka and Takeuchi 
1995). Knowledge management approach can only be effective if it takes into account both types of knowledge (Goh 
2002). Depending on this distinction, literature offers two strategies to manage knowledge: Codification and 
Personalization (Woods and Cortada 2013).

1049","70%. Also, to solve these problems, people in the company usually rely on previous experiences or 
documentation for only 20% and complete the 80% of their analysis with their expertise or by applying 
brainstorming and creative thinking methods. As the codification strategy is not efficient in cases of 
customized and innovative products and tacit problem solving, we do not need to evaluate this alternative 
regarding these criteria. Same logic concerns the personalization strategy with 𝐶𝐶1, 𝐶𝐶3 and 𝐶𝐶5. 
Decision makers may also determine different weights to criteria depending on the particularities of their 
activity and following the weighting matrix explained in Section 3 (Table 2). All this data is used to obtain 
a performance matrix as presented in Table 4.

Thus, after calculating all the indices, one alternative will outrank the second one. The company can then 
decide on its primary and secondary strategy based on the results of this assessment. The primary strategy is 
the one with the best performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper is concerned with the selection process of the most adapted KM strategy for its company.  It focused on 
codification and personalization strategies developed in literature. This work is based on the method proposed by 
Hansen, Nohria and Tierney previously to help companies determine which strategy is likely to be the primary one. 
This article aims to provide more rational guidance to companies in cases where the Hansen model is no longer 
sufficient. This method is based on the MCDA processes on four stages and uses six decision criteria derived from 
Hansen and al's three questions. It was decided to use the weighted sum method for the aggregation phase for ease of 
illustration but other more sophisticated methods can also be considered.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia has become the fourth most populated country in the world after China, India, and the United States with a 
total of 270.2 million people by 2020. Many problems in different fields such as social, economic, health, education, 
and environmental could arise due to high population growth. One of the solutions that the Indonesian government 
provides is the family planning program which is covered by the National Population and Family Planning Board 
(BKKBN). The institution is now facing the limitations caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic and is working 
harder to ensure the completion of BKKBN’s strategic planning. The PESTLE analysis methodology is used to help 
analyze issues under political, economic, social, technology, legal and environment factors and their impact on this 
matter. Our findings show that BKKBN could reach their success through several external factors, although may find 
challenges from some, and need to make crucial decisions towards several factors. Though managed to assess 
BKKBN’s success factors, quantitative future research needs to be conducted.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world. According to the population census conducted by the 
Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) in 2020, the population of Indonesia has reached 270.2 million people. This number 
has increased by 32.56 million people from the previous population census in 2010. This indicates population growth 
in Indonesia increases every year. High population growth leads to many problems in different fields such as social, 
economic, health, education, and environmental problems that need to be handled immediately. 
The government has made various efforts to overcome problems related to population growth. One of their solutions 
is a family planning program aimed for couples of childbearing ages by the use of contraceptives. Indonesia was also 
one of the pioneers among developing countries in the establishment of a comprehensive family planning program 
(Hatton et al. 2018). The use of contraceptives enables people to understand their rights to freely and responsibly 
decide whether, when, and how many children to have. The increasing use of contraceptive methods has led not only 
to changes in health results such as decreased maternal mortality and infant mortality (Arthur et al. 2012; Chola et al. 
2015; World Health Organization 2019; Samat et al. 2021), but also to changes in education and financial results, 
particularly for women (Gustavo et al. 2005; Karen et al. 2015; Zeynep et al. 2017; Sultan 2018). 
In Indonesia, the family planning program is covered by the National Population and Family Planning Board 
(BKKBN) which was established in 1970. Through BKKBN, policy was designed to slow population growth and to 
improve health particularly that of women and children (Hull 2003; Lubis 2003; Hatton et al. 2018). Family planning 
(FP) programs in Indonesia have been applied for 40 years. The country has tried to meet the needs of reproduction 
health, even to the population in hard-to-reach areas. 
By the end of 2019, BKKBN introduced the term KKBPK Program to become the Family Development, Population 
and Family Planning Program or abbreviated as Bangga Kencana. This program has become their strategic plan in the 
period of 2020 to 2024. A measure of the success for all priority programs and activities is carried out in the form of

1057","5.6 Environment Implication 
Since 1980, the green revolution and continued population growth have become a serious problem worldwide. The 
United nations (UN) estimates that the total human population worldwide will reach 9 billion by 2050 and possibly 
11.2 billion by the end of this century. A number of scientists have warned against the dangers of atmospheric levels 
of greenhouse gases produced by human activities that can cause global warming and climate disruption (Anderson 
2019). The Environment faced by mankind today is human overpopulation, too many humans use too many resources 
and deplete available resources each year at an accelerating rate. Increasing the need for resources to sustain a growing 
human population is one of the threats to the environment that is exacerbated by climate change. Generally, the biggest 
cause is the absence of clear and direct awareness and responsibility of the importance of protecting the environment, 
the first step that can solve the problem of the environmental threats is to be responsible for the number of human 
population growth (Yi and Borzée 2021). BKKBN direct awareness and responsibility for the importance of saving 
the environment from global warming and avoiding limited natural resources is one of the driving forces for the 
implementation of the family planning program (Table 8).

6. Conclusion 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the external influences on the success of the BKKBN strategic planning as 
outlined in the BKKBN strategic planning for the 2020-2024 period. Analysis of the barriers or support from political, 
economic, social, technology, legal and environment factors is done to see the possibility of success in the BKKBN 
strategic plan for the 2020-2024 period. These factors have been shown influencing the family planning programs, not 
specifically in Indonesia, but throughout the world. The success of BKKBN’s family planning programs should be 
seen through the implementation of the strategies and completion of targets. 
The findings of our research indicate that BKKBN has many positive future possibilities in implementing its strategies, 
as well as completing its strategic targets. In order to ensure the success of its strategy implementation for target 
achievement, BKKBN should put an effort in utilizing this supporting nature in implementing family planning 
programs. Some factors, however, could challenge BKKBN’s success. BKKBN should address threatening factors 
like corruption in their own body, economic instability, as well as more social challenges like religion and cultural 
beliefs. Current population problem could be a meaningful threat as well to BKKBN’s success. Other remaining 
factors are very dependable on how BKKBN could address them. Factors such as civilian trust, as well as political 
and economic decentralization could be a great boost in the success of family planning programs arranged by 
governmental bodies like BKKBN. But, just like a double-edged sword, they could be a major threat for this success. 
Ataullahjan et al. (2019) has shown how deteriorating civilian trust could put family planning programs into busts. 
This study managed to assess the potential supports and barriers to BKKBN’s strategy implementation and target 
completion. However, this paper faces limitations on sources, as many of the sourcing research papers are focusing 
on the family planning matters outside, not inside Indonesia, which is the base of BKKBN’s operation. The sources 
available also limited the coverage of our researched strategies, thus unable to see the implications of BKKBN’s whole 
strategies, even when we managed to cover all the targets. Since this paper has qualitatively analyzed the barriers or 
support for the success of the program, future researches may work on the quantitative analysis of the factors 
influencing.

Abstract 
 
This paper aims to explore strategies that food and beverage companies are implementing to increase the resilience 
and sustainability of production systems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted based on analysis 
of primary data which includes surveys and interviews and a review of secondary data which includes websites, 
academic journals, case studies, research reports, books, and annual reports. The findings revealed that the companies 
have taken different strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to shifting behavior on consumers that more 
activities are carried out at home to prevent the spread of the virus. Porter's generic strategies adopted by the food and 
beverage companies have helped the company through the situation either in increasing or declining sales demand. 
This paper reveals that implementing a low-cost leadership strategy is essential for the success of a multinational 
beverage company that is experiencing a decline in demand while implementing a focus strategy is the best choice for 
sustainable production in the trend of increasing demand for a sugar refinery company.

1. Introduction 
According to WHO data until the end of 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 
79 million positive cases and 1.7 million more victims worldwide (WHO, 2020). The Indonesian government has 
made a number of attempts to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, including urging people to wear masks, wash 
their hands regularly, keep a safe distance, and stay at home (Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, 2020). 
COVID-19 is changing how consumers behave across all spheres of life, from how they work to how they shop to 
how they entertain themselves (McKinsey, 2020). Along with the increasing activities carried out by the consumers 
at home, cooking activities at home and food delivery using third parties are becoming popular in Indonesia (Cahyani 
et al., 2019),  and eating out less, which results in changes in the level of consumption of several products (Nielsen, 
2020). The food delivery is supported by the technology on smartphones that continue to develop from year to year 
which have penetrated various aspects of everyday life (Fainusa et al., 2019). It makes it easier for people to live their 
daily lives even if only at home. iRi POS data report of COVID-19 impact stated edible products are expected to have 
an increased demand and non-edible products shall have a moderate need globally, decreased demand which includes 
homecare, cosmetics, and personal care products (iRi POS data, 2020). This environmental change has had a major 
impact on business activities for many companies, especially in the demand trends for the food supply chain affected 
by COVID-19. Food supply chain refers to all the processes that describe how foods from farms end up on our tables, 
including farming, processing, distributing, retailing, and consuming. The flexibility of a model fresh produce supply 
chain was used in a study on the impact of the COVID-19 on the food supply chain, which was based on the real 
choice theory and defined the food supply chain resilience in terms of its flexibility (Chitrakar et al., 2021). Similarly, 
Hobbs (2020) examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chain and its resilience in terms of 
disruptions in industry, transportation, and labor shortages, as well as shocks on the demand side, such as consumer

services department conducts the cost saving in spare parts usage, equipment delivery, and regular service activities. 
The significant savings come from manufacturing and supply chain planning.  
In manufacturing, the company has had to restructure the organization to be leaner, which is to release all 
their casual employees and optimize the workload of their permanent employees. Giving them more training and tools 
to help them in their additional job. Besides that, the manufacturing management had to strengthen their spending on 
employees over time, and no replacement for permanent employees who had retired during this year. Productivity 
increased by improving line production efficiency and reducing the number of products rejected. Variable cost in the 
manufacturing is reduced by optimizing the electrical usage in the whole area, optimizing the Natural gas usage in 
producing steam by minimizing the heat exchanger time used, and several activities to minimize the chemicals usage 
in water treatment, waste water treatment and production area.  Fixed cost in the manufacturing reduced by pending 
the overhaul activities in line productions due to less volume in actual rather than the planning. The frequency of 
special service is also reduced to get an extra cost saving from fixed cost. Several rental of plant equipment is also 
reviewed and cancelled. In the supply chain planning area, the cost saving mainly generated by the activities of cost 
cutting of product and material delivery, prefer to do direct shipment rather than non-direct shipment, substitute the 
material with the lower price but still meet the quality requirements. All these cost saving activities are adopting the 
Lean concept, which is eliminating waste and reducing variability. 
On the other hand, the external side of Low-Cost Leadership strategies had been implemented by conducting 
promotion of bundle packages which had lower prices than regular prices. The promotion was given to maintain their 
position in the competitive market and also to gain the sales volume. The promotion itself is divided into three types, 
the first type is promotion that offers combination and non-combination of the soft drink products, which give the 
customer lower price around 15 - 50%. There is also an extra advantage for the customer who bought the products 
more than the minimum quantity, which is direct delivery to the customers' houses. It helps the customers to avoid 
contact with others related to prevention of COVID-19 spread. The second type is the promotion that offers the bundle 
package with other products such as fast food or snacks. It gives the consumer a lower price around 20% than the 
normal price. The last type is promotion that collaborates with the tourist resorts, restaurants, cafes, and internet service 
providers. 
 
6. Conclusion 
COVID-19 has resulted in shifting behavior in the communities that more activities are carried out at home. 
Increased activity in the home also has an impact on changes in the level of consumption, especially food and beverage. 
The study shows that both Food and Beverage companies in Indonesia are affected by this shifting behavior, which 
causes the change in their sales demand.  This condition has led the company to implement the strategy based on the 
impact to their sales volume. The identification shows that Porter's Generic strategy, especially Low-Cost Leadership 
strategy and Focus strategy has been adopted by the company to go through this period of COVID-19 in 2020, either 
to fulfill the increasing sales demand or come up through the declining sales demand. However, there is still room for 
improvement to the strategies, regarding the period of COVID-19 still not over yet in 2021.

Abstract 
 
This work was directed to the application of advanced machine learning and process control tools in an industrial 
penicillin production bioreactor. The developed algorithms were the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method, 
for reducing data dimensionality, and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN), directed to create a 
multivariable interpolation model to predict the bioreactor temperature. Regarding the process control phase, the 
Model Predictive Control (MPC) method was used, which aims to calculate a sequence of control actions capable of 
approximating the output variables with their respective set points in an optimized way. In this paper, information 
from a real industrial process of penicillin production was analyzed, dealing with a database composed of 27 variables 
to be treated. The gaussian radial base function gave the neural network model a better adaptation to the system. 
Finally, the control actions calculated by the MPC controller resulted in the maintenance of the controlled variables 
in its respective set points in a gradual manner, without impacting the stability of the system.

1. Introduction 
The concept of smart manufacturing has drawn the attention of both academia and corporative world in recent years, 
being classified as a priority to be achieved by the main economic potencies. It consists of a series of measures that 
seek to promote greater connectivity between equipment and machines with a better use and interpretation of the data 
obtained to achieve greater competitive advantages, quality and profitability. However, due to the advancement of 
measurement and communication technologies, the transcendence of one era marked by the scarcity of data in 
industrial processes to another characterized by the excessive amount of information generated has become more 
evident, making data management more complex and challenging (BOGLE, 2017). 
 
An illustration of such scenario is found in the pharmaceutical industry, where the implementation of control systems 
is increasingly mandatory. With the transformation of raw materials into value-added effective drugs as the main 
objective, it is essential that such reactions occur efficiently, which implies an unceasing search for high yields and 
the minimization of raw materials variability and impurities (ROGERS, HASHEMI, & IERAPETRITOU, 2013). In 
this way, the sector has been marked by high investments in the research and development of a multitude of new 
computational methodologies for systems integration and optimization, which have obtained relative success in 
stabilizing such processes (BOUKOUVALA, MUZZIO, & IERAPETRITOU, 2010). However, in the presence of 
processes with large disturbances and many variables to be manipulated, the efficiency of such control systems is 
compromised due to the generation of an excessive amount of data from different sources and structures at high 
frequencies of sampling. This difficulty enables the occurrence of operational failures and as their effects propagate 
they can lead to accidents and interruptions with serious consequences to workers and the environment (ISERMANN, 
2006). In this sense, it is necessary to implement different process systems engineering (PSE) techniques, such as the 
Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning, which have shown to be quite effective in containing and preventing 
faults. The former consists of the installation of sensors in unit operations to capture process information, promote

Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the implementation of the neural network and the MPC 
controller via Python® were both satisfied and similarly successful. It was possible to observe the importance of such 
tools in the chemical process industry, not only related to the control of processes, but also through the deep analysis 
of the data that allows corporations to achieve higher quality and profitability margins. 
 
Regarding the development of the neural network, it was found through the principal components analysis (PCA) 
algorithm that the optimal number of variables that explained 95% of the data behavior was equal to 11, which 
decreased the computational effort to perform its calculations and simplified the interpretation of results. Such 
variables were the flowrates of sugar, soybean oil, phenylacetic acid, acid and base, dilution water, removed broth, 
aeration, pH and temperature. 
 
In addition, the application of the gaussian radial basis function resulted in a better fit to the experimental data, since 
the SSE value was the lowest among the other functions. Finally, the control actions calculated by the MPC controller 
resulted in the maintenance of the controlled variables (substrate concentration, reactor temperature) in its respective 
set points in a gradual manner, without impacting the stability of the system or exploring it, which would compromise 
the integrity of the raw materials and, consequently, the quality of the final product. Another point to note was that 
the control actions were performed within the specified limits, and that it performance metrics were superior when 
compared with other controller types.

Abstract 
 
In formulating policy recommendations to increase the use of the local content, called Tingkat Komponen Dalam 
Negeri (TKDN), the Government makes special regulations in the scope of the procurement of goods and services 
related to the local content elements specified in Articles 85, 86, 87, and 88 of Law no. 3 of 2014 on Industry. The 
main objectives of this research paper are to study Cost Leadership strategies, Differentiation strategies, and Focus 
strategies. Porter’s generic strategy was chosen as a theoretical method to analyze the benefits of adopting these 
strategies at PT Stainless Steel Primavalve. We collected data on the certificate items (product, type, specifications, 
and local content), which are from the PT Stainless Steel Primavalve Certificate on the website of the P3DN Ministry 
of Industry. Through the analysis, it can be seen that with the coverage of Local Content values we can identify the 
strategy used of PT Stainless steel Primavalve. From the identification results, we can conclude that the Company 
implements the Porter Strategy in the Business Strategy which involves the mechanism for procuring goods and 
services in utilizing Local Content as price preferences during the tender process in increasing competitiveness as a 
form of a strategy used.

1. Introduction (12 font) 
Oil and gas are natural resources that have a broad range of utilization such as for cooking, generating electricity in 
power plants, and as raw material for the processing of fertilizer. Indonesia is a country that has very abundant natural 
resources, including oil and natural gas, (Hakim et al., 2018). The valve is an important part of the equipment oil and 
gas pipeline, (Peng et al., 2021). Therefore, in the procurement of goods and services in the oil and gas industry sector, 
in formulating policy recommendations to increase the use of the local content, called Tingkat Komponen Dalam 
Negeri (TKDN), the Government makes special regulations in the scope of the procurement of goods and services 
related to the local content elements specified in Articles 85, 86, 87, and 88 of Law no. 3 of 2014 on Industry. 
 
To increase the competitive advantage in the oil and gas industry in Indonesia, strategy is very important to help a 
company secure its position in industrial competition. It also supports the company in challenging its competitors and 
achieving superior performance, (Štefan and Branislav, 2016). Technological advancement is an important factor in 
manufacturing development. It also exposes all sectors, companies, and other institutions to intense competition.  
 
Cost Leadership, Differentiation, and Focus Strategies are the basic competitive advantages made by Porter (1980). 
According to Barney (1991), a company that wants to be competitive must implement a value creation strategy that is 
different from other competitors. The Cost Leadership Strategy is classified as temporary and in the long term is not 
possible, (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). Porter (1985) also asserts that focus can be based on (1) differentiation 
targeting specific market segments with unique needs that are not met by others in the industry or (2) cost focus where 
firms have access to specialized production equipment and operations to save costs of a smaller production or 
production line. On the other hand, a competitive advantage is created from the Differentiation Strategy in which more 
sustainable products and unique facilities are offered to the market and are very difficult for competitors to imitate,

1087","5. Results 
In this paper, we will be analyzing and discussing how to obtain a competitive advantage through applying different 
business strategies. From Table 1, there are 5 types of valves and 12 Local Content values in the certificate. In the 
next step, we will make each Local Content value of each specification and product type listed on the certificate, then 
this value is used as a benchmark for achieving the minimum local content required by government regulations. 
According to the data in table 1, the value of Local Content in each product category has a value > 25%. Therefore, 
according to Presidential Decree No. 16 of 2018, given to goods/services that have a TKDN of at least 25%, from 
table 1 we can know that with a value > 25%, a company will get a price preference. After the assessment of the Local 
Content results obtained, this study also identifies with several strategic approaches, which are Cost Leadership, 
Differentiation, and Focus. 
 
5.1 Cost Leadership 
As mentioned above, the fundamental objective of a cost leadership strategy is to reduce costs as much as possible on 
the grounds of ensuring product quality, so that it can occupy a dominant position in the industry. From the data 
analysis above, PT. Stainless Steel Primavalve implemented a cost leadership strategy with an approach in taking the 
opportunity to get price preferences in a procurement process. Therefore, the price offered by the company during the 
procurement process will be lower because it gets a price preference by having a TKDN value > 25%.In further 
research, this can be done in more detail regarding the application of data leadership strategies by taking primary data 
from the product manufacturing process. 
 
5.2 Differentiation 
One of the main advantages of using a differentiation strategy is the company's ability to differentiate itself from others 
in competitive markets. Furthermore, the differentiation strategy can be split into different sub-strategies in response 
to the continuous development and complexity of the business environment. Such as differentiation based on product 
innovation, customer responsiveness, or marketing. From the data analysis above, PT. Stainless Steel Primavalve 
implemented the differentiation strategy used are based on product innovation that has more value, such as the TKDN 
/ Local Content Certificate. 
 
5.3 Focus 
The last strategy is a focus. This strategy means targeting and attracting niche markets of customers with specific 
tastes or needs that differ from the larger population. It is known that not all procurement of goods and services are 
required to use local content, several non-governmental companies do not refer to government policies in using local 
content as the basis for procurement. From the identification results, that the company PT Stainless Steel Primavalve 
used a focus strategy to enter the market which requires a TKDN certificate. Thus, the Company's market will niche 
because of the demand for the use of local content according to government policies. 
 
6. Discussion 
Organizations can choose a combination strategy by mixing one of the common cost leadership or differentiation 
strategies with a focused strategy. As such, these strategies that support gaining competitive advantage apply to all 
industries in most countries. Such a perspective on the use of strategy has provided a necessary alternative to other 
views of strategy in doing a better job of taking strategic action. It can be said that strategy is an essential part of an 
effective business plan. By using an effective competitive strategy, companies can provide quality services. This also 
shows that the company has a competitive advantage through the implementation of different business strategies. 
 
7. Conclusion  
This paper describes Porter’s Generic Strategic approach chosen as a theoretical method to analyze the benefits of 
implementing this strategy at PT. Stainless Steel Primavalve. As previously mentioned, the main objectives in this 
research paper are to identify Cost Leadership strategies, Differentiation strategies, and Focus strategies. Through the 
analysis of the above cases, it can be seen that with the coverage of Local Content values we can identify the strategy 
used of PT Stainless steel Primavalve. Value of local content PT. Primavalve Stainless Steel has a value above 25%, 
which by ""PTK 007 Rev 04"" will be given a maximum price preference of 15%. This means, a company will get a 
price reduction from the price offered during the procurement process, which will provide the opportunity to be the 
lowest bidder. From the identification results, we can conclude that the Company implements the Porter Strategy in

1092","the Business Strategy which involves the mechanism for procuring goods and services in utilizing Local Content as 
price preferences during the tender process in increasing competitiveness as a form of a strategy used. 
 
The strategy of the organization should reflect the competitive advantage that distinguishes it from others. In the case 
of PT Stainless Steel Primavalve, applying Porter’s strategy can generate benefits to the organization as well. 
However, this paper only focused on the case study of PT Stainless Steel Primavalve, which is representative of many 
manufactures pursuing Portes's strategy. In further research, this can be carried out for the type of manufacturer to 
perform data analysis and explore broader general rules.

Abstract 
 
The supply chains around the agri-food sector are, in economic terms, one of the most relevant activities at an 
international level, employing millions of people, mainly in developing countries. The complexity of this supply chain 
includes key aspects related to the identification of food, from origin to final consumption. 
This article conceptually describes a proposal for developing a traceability system based on Blockchain and smart 
contracts as a disruptive technology, integrating tools for the consensus and participation of the parties involved in 
this supply chain. In this approach, incorporating the Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) is 
proposed as an information management mechanism. The different entities for the supply chain are described, 
including the inclusion of logistics operators (3PL). The results show a model for the implementation of Blockchain 
based on smart contracts and traceability tools such as PPGIS. This proposal facilitates the development of logistical 
aspects to increase the competitiveness of the agri-food sector.

1. Introduction  
The supply chains around the agri-food sector are, in economic terms, one of the most relevant activities at an 
international level, employing millions of people, mainly in developing countries. In particular, agriculture and food 
supply chains have positioned themselves as an industry that generates trillions of dollars annually (Miloudi et al., 
2020). These agri-food supply chains offer a response to the nutritional needs of people around the world, seeking to 
sustainably preserve natural resources, also promoting progress and quality of life in rural areas where food is 
produced, sown or harvested.  
 
According to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the agri-food sector 
will have to increase its yields in a sustainable way by 70% by 2050. Given this scenario of growing demand for food, 
and that could lead to a food crisis, the need for ""smart agriculture"" is imminent and necessary to ensure the 
sustainability of the sector itself and of the supply chains that are interrelated with it. Generally, the products of the 
agri-food sector are used as inputs in some supply chains, where the consumer is usually the end customer (Borrero, 
2019). 
 
An agri-food supply chain is an extremely complex system (Dutta et al., 2020), which allows the circulation and 
distribution of agricultural products in different markets. The agri-food supply chain is also made up of different 
parties involved, including farmers, distributors, processors, wholesalers, retailers, and end consumers, who demand 
safe and high-quality products that include as much information as possible (Antonucci et al. , 2019). One of the main 
characteristics of these supply chains is that they are traditionally centralized and depend on a third party or 
intermediary (Granillo-Macías et al., 2018), to trade the products, so they lack transparency, responsibility, and 
audibility (Shahid et al., 2020). The geographical dispersion of farmers in rural areas, seasonality, and logistics 
requirements in food distribution are also relevant factors. (Miloudi et al., 2020) identifies the agri-food supply chain 
as a complex system dominated by factors such as food waste, expensive intermediaries, disconnection between 
suppliers and retailers, and sources of financing and limited payment options for Farmers. Small farmers' livelihoods

the blockchain layer. 
 
Integrating the information from the data layer with PPGIS within the blockchain layer also allows addressing the 
identification of risk and uncertainty that is inherent in agriculture. The most common sources of risk present in the 
barley agri-food chain and that can be analyzed with PPGIS, include meteorological conditions, climate, diseases in 
the crop, natural disasters (floods and droughts) and market disturbances and the environment (Basualdo et al., 2015). 
The construction of the Smart contract with PPGIS can promote communication and involve the parties involved in 
an iterative process that refines the understanding of traceability and specific perceptions of the planting site. 
 
Following the smart contract functions, the harvested product is sold by the farmers to the malting plant, verifying 
specific conditions that can alter the quality of the product, such as the percentage of moisture in the grain and the 
temperature. In the malt, during the operations carried out to process the grain and convert it into malt, the variables 
that evaluate the quality of the product must be recorded in the blockchain layer; these variables include: 1) moisture, 
2) total protein in malt, 3) protein soluble in must, 3) viscosity of must, 4) sugar content, among others. The malt 
obtained is bought by the beer producing company, where it is processed to obtain the final product. Beer making is 
a very complex process due to the many chemical reactions involved, ranging from malting to final bottling. In this 
stage, quality aspects related to the chemical composition (protein and sugar content, alcohol and carbon dioxide 
concentration) are analyzed (Gonzalez Viejo et al., 2018). The final product is collected by the 3PLs for delivery to 
the different distributors. The distributor selects the types of transportation, routes, and warehouse locations available 
for delivery to resellers. Finally, resellers buy small quantities of the final product, from distributors or wholesalers, 
for direct sale to the final consumer. Throughout these downstream operations, in the supply chain, all product 
registration transactions, batch additions, and updating of transaction hashes are permanently stored in the storage 
layer. Transactions are written to the Blockchain to ensure that a product is successfully transferred between the 
different entities in the supply chain, ensuring the process of tracing the origin of the data. 
 
In the storage layer, through IPFS and with the support of PPGIS, all images, data and records are digitally signed 
and attributed to a certain entity, within the supply chain. According to (Salah et al., 2019) because the information 
as uploaded by the entity, this means that the farmer is the owner of said action and is responsible for inaccurate or 
fraudulent images. In these cases, the smart contract can be programmed in an automated way to impose sanctions 
on entities if they act dishonestly (Borrero, 2019; Salah et al., 2019; Shahid et al., 2020). 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The use of the Blockchain seeks to discourage data manipulation, preventing people from entering false or erroneous 
information or hiding information on the Blockchain. Although there are technologies based on the use of sensors and 
IoT devices to minimize the problems of capturing and obtaining information, Blockchain cannot, by itself, eliminate 
fraud in the food chain. When more available data is linked to the Blockchain, it will be easier to detect it, due to the 
possibility of using cross-checks and the immutability of the records. The great challenge for Blockchain in the agri-
food supply chain is to connect the different technologies for traceability with models for decision-making, favoring 
the different entities that make up this sector. 
 
In addition, the PPGIS provides clear visualizations of the disparities in access to transportation and resources 
experienced by some imagined farming communities and allows a better understanding of ways to combat these 
disparities. 
 
Blockchain-based applications for the agro-food sector also look for aspects related to food safety, monitoring, and 
control of food quality. This proposal seeks to achieve traceability that favors reducing waste, the analysis of reliable 
operational data, and efficient exchanges of contracts and transactions to reduce economic costs, thus supporting small 
farmers. 
These applications can be developed using existing blockchain-based technology tools to facilitate quick and easy 
developments. Based on different implementation scenarios of these applications, other computational and 
cryptographic techniques can be connected to provide flexibility to meet the requirements of different users.

Abstract 
 
DYAC is a web application that uses some theoretical notions from the linguistics of documentation and the scientific 
documentation. For the development of the software, we used the Yii2 framework and the database engine with GNU 
/ GP open code license MariaDB. In 2018, the Universidad del Azuay (UDA) signed an agreement for Scientific and 
Technological Cooperation between seven Universities of Latin American; for that reason, the LIDI team of 
researchers from the Universidad del Azuay, as a contribution to the aforementioned agreement, proposes the 
development of the application for DYAC Scientific Documentation and Archives. The objective is design and 
develop the web application to store, and publish research files. A systematic literature review identified eleven 
websites, which allowed determining the most relevant and significant attributes to model in the design of the database 
of the web application.  We combined the methodologies GORSHCHEK, SCRUM, and OOHDM. The most results 
show that DYAC has application administrator, researcher, registered user and visiting; in its structure, the application 
evidence of two sub-applications:  the Backend and the Frontend web application. Finally, there is a strong 
commitment to socio-diversity, cultural diversity and linguistic diversity. Documentation and scientific archives take 
on importance.

6. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
In Ecuador, as in other Latin American countries, there is a strong compromise with socio diversity, cultural diversity, 
and linguistic diversity, which represent an intangible heritage to these regions. In these circumstances is where 
documentation and scientific records gain importance because they become the ideal means to protect and preserve 
heritage. 
 
The application DYAC was created to help with the documentation and preservation of linguistic and sociocultural 
resources captured naturally through audio, video, photography, maps, and other formats, so they can be catalogued 
in an adequate way. They could also serve as sources for linguistic and educational policy that could be used to

Additionally, DYAC has considered the possibility of interacting and exchanging these resources among researches, 
archivers, and users in the region. We are convinced that through this activity, we will contribute to socially validate 
these cultural and linguistic intangibles of the country and the region.

Abstract 
 
An established resilient healthcare system is vital in any governmental structure to protect the public’s well-being 
during unexpected events such as occurrence of disasters. In the Philippines, barangay is the basic political unit with 
immediate access to the people affected by disasters. This study aims to design a framework to determine the resilience 
of the healthcare system at the smallest local government unit using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy approach (FAHP) 
approach. The FAHP is used to establish the contributing factors and sub-factors in the design of a resilient healthcare 
system. The final results show that disaster preparedness as the main priority factor with a rating of 44.77%. Service 
Continuity followed far behind at 16.60%, and then followed closely by Resources and Recovery Adaptation at 
14.74% and 14.63%, respectively. Safety and Vulnerability came last in the prioritization ranking at 9.25%.

1. Introduction 
 
The Philippines is one of the countries located in the Pacific Ring of Fire which makes it more vulnerable and exposed 
to natural disasters. In fact, it has ranked 4th in the list of countries that are most prone to natural disasters based on a 
20-year evaluation of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) (Foreign Service Institute, 
2016). To support this fact, Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (2017) states that there is at least 
60% of the total land area of the country that is exposed to multiple hazards such as typhoons, storm surges, floods, 
volcanic activities, earthquakes, drought, and tsunamis. It also reports that about 565 natural disasters have struck the 
country leaving an estimate of $23 billion damages and 70, 000 lives lost. Furthermore, Philippine Health Review 
describes the damages left by these natural disasters as indelible marks that greatly affected the culture, economy, and 
the whole of society. Some of the most recent terrible disasters are the Typhoon Yolanda in 2013, also referred to as 
the strongest that ever landed in the planet (Mullen, 2013), that caused 6,000 reported fatalities and 1.1 million homes 
damaged, volcanic eruption of Mayon Volcano in 2018 which forced people in the affected radius to evacuate and 
leave their livelihood unprotected, and the El Niño or nationwide drought that have always affected the livelihood of 
many Filipino farmers and other businesses. Amidst the global pandemic, on November 2020, another super typhoon 
with international name, Goni, badly hits Luzon affecting millions of Filipinos.  
 
To strengthen the country’s institutional capacity to uphold the rights to life and property, the Republic Act of 10121 
was established in 2010. RA 10121 provides the legal basis for policies, plans and programs to deal with disasters 
resulting to the establishment of disaster key agency, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council 
(NDRRMC). The healthcare system resilience of the Local Government Unit (LGU) is one of NDRRMC’s tasks. 
Through the creation of NDRRMC, the country has made progress in DRRM. Through the new disaster agency and 
the help of local and international organizations, the government was able to shift from emergency relief operations 
towards risk mitigation and preparation. Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) together with 
the World Bank was able to improve the country’s financial resilience by providing the government liquidity worth 
$500 for post-disaster recovery.

1114","All expert judgements got a consistency ratio of below 10% thus passing the consistency tests. This proves that the 
judgements of each expert were consistent to be used as reliable basis of results. The group consistency ratio of the 
two sets of experts also passed the 5% limit at 3.86% and 4,28%, respectively. This suggests that the individual 
judgements of the experts have low enough differences to achieve a consensus in prioritization. 
 
4. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
The resilience healthcare system at a barangay level determines the capacity of the community to withstand the effects 
before, during, and after a disaster strikes it. This is in line with the disaster risk reduction and management objective 
that aims to prepare, train, and equip everyone in case a disaster strike. However, several circumstances such as 
mistaken prioritization of needs lead the community to fail to achieve such therefore resulting to more casualties. This 
research gives importance to the designing a framework that could identify the factors that affect the resiliency of the 
barangay’s healthcare system with the use of fuzzy AHP approach. 
 
From the results obtained, it can be seen that priorities vary from one barangay to another. Although the barangays 
under study are neighboring barangays with the same sets of needs, it is very evident that the way they look at priorities 
are different.  The Fuzzy AHP model was used effectively in defining the differences in each. Furthermore, this study 
could be used for future references but it is also highly suggested to increase the scope of the study and the number of 
interviewees so as to have more insights and comparisons on the study.

1. Introduction 
1.1  Objectives 
Zamzam Medical Clinic  is a reference clinic for examining prospective migrant workers. Zamzam Medical is 
required to provide medical check-up services according to health service standards. Since August 2016 to 
February 2018 Zamzam Medical Clinic served 26674 medical check-up patients with an average of 1404 patients 
per month. However, the limited number of workers makes the process time in running the business inefficient, 
thus making this clinic indirectly spend more cost-effective costs.  
 
Based on the decision number: 14/KPPU-L/2009 and from data obtained from the Gulf Cooperation Center 
Approved Medical Center Association (GAMCA) or the Association of Health Facilities specifically for Middle 
Eastern countries, Zamzam Medical Cetre clinic was appointed as one of 22 referral clinics for the examination 
of prospective Indonesian workers. Within this competitive era, organization is required to improve its 
performance to win the competition. It can be done by reducing spending, innovating processes and products, and 
improving quality and productivity. According to Assauri (2008), the process is a way, method and technique of 
how the resources (manpower, machinery, materials and funds) are changed to obtain an outcome. The 
organization will do some ways to reduce production costs or services cost. One way to reduce spending can be 
done by increasing the amount of output with a predetermined working time and also eliminating work activities 
that do not have value added in a production or even services. 
 
Zamzam Medical Clinic with 30 employees. With details of the number of medical officers 8 people consisting 
of 1 administration, 1 cashier, 2 laboratory analysts, 1 nurse, 1 doctor and 2 radiographers for the X-Ray photo 
section, 2 online results and the rest as managers, online results input clerk, cleaning service and driver. With 10 
medical service personnel serving an average of 94 patients a day. Operating hours start from 09.00 - 17.00. MCU 
patients more often come near 12.00 and 16.30. Laboratory tests take ± 1 hour 52 minutes, longer than other tests.

6. Conclusion 
Zamzam Medical Clinic can implement the new strategies, because the new implementation is more helpful and 
also can saving more money for the company. Meanwhile for the all process, we eliminated the process of 
Changing clothes, because the other process is needed in every unit, cause its related to medical process. And also, 
by using Porter Strategy that focus on Cost Leadership Zamzam Medical Clinic can expand the customer segment 
with different condition of course, but without leaving their service quality. The result of this research there are 
still shortcomings because we only review and focus in one company in medical sector, so for future research can 
review more company and another sector of company, so other company can compare which are the process that 
can be implemented or not, and also can reduce the cost of all the process.

Abstract 
 
Recently most companies have realized the importance of using digital technologies, especially the internet of things 
and big data, as it has a great impact on several industries such as Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), 
Transportation/Logistics, Automotive, Textiles and ready-made garments, Pharmaceuticals, etc. Before applying the 
internet of things and big data, companies must first assess the readiness to ensure successful implementation and 
avoid organization failure. The purpose of this research is to investigate the readiness of Egyptian companies to adopt 
the internet of things and big data. Thus, this research proposes the readiness model for the internet of things and big 
data which consists of nine factors: strategy, top management involvement and commitment, financial readiness, team 
readiness, technical richness/ skills, IT readiness, data architecture, security, and data quality. This is a work in process 
research that will study the readiness of Egyptian companies to adopt the internet of things (IoT) and big data (BD). 
In this paper, the literature review and theoretical framework for assessing the IoT and BD readiness of Egyptian 
companies are presented.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, as economic changes, world fluctuations, and rapid technological development have taken place, many 
companies looked forward to be more innovative and shift to digital transformation/ digitalization, especially using 
two main technologies the internet of things and big data in different sectors. According to IDC (2019), around 79.4 
ZB of data will be generated and more than 50 billion sensors and devices will be connected to the internet by 2025. 
Internet of things is an innovative technology, in other words, “an intelligent network, an invisible network fabric that 
can be sensed, controlled, and programmed. IoT-enabled products employ embedded technology that allows them to 
communicate, directly or indirectly, with each other or the Internet” (Chase 2013). It’s worth noting that the data 
produced from IoT can be managed and analyzed by big data technology. 
 
Internet of things and big data technologies play a vital role in the industrial and business sector. For instance, IoT and 
BD can help companies in improving efficiency, cost-saving, enhancing production, increasing profitability, 
increasing flexibility, eliminating the breaks, improving the quality and level of safety, improving the product variety, 
and increasing customer satisfaction, etc. Examples of Global companies that have adopted digital technologies (IoT

Abstract 
 
The wastewater utility industry serves a critical function for a nation’s growth and is one of the essential 
pillars for a healthy infrastructure system. Efficient operations and maintenance of wastewater 
infrastructure heavily rely on material and equipment available at the right time in the right quantities. 
Therefore, making correct inventory management strategic decisions a paramount necessity to gain cost 
efficiencies. At present, a common practice in the industry for decision making is entirely dependent on the 
experience of the team or individuals in the decision-making process. In this research, strategic inventory 
management decision-making tools are developed for the wastewater utility industry. The tools include an 
inventory management maturity framework, a qualitative and quantitative material-specific inventory 
management sourcing policy selector. The maturity model developed takes into account criteria related to 
cost, culture, process, and technology from industry practitioners’ experience and their envisioned future. 
The qualitative decision-making tool is demonstrated using sample data intended to be acquired from a 
global survey. The quantitative decision tool is demonstrated by performing economic assessment 
simulations of various scenarios, by investigating a case study for inventory management sourcing policies, 
using in-house and performance-based contracts for mobile flood mitigation pumps. The findings highlight 
the selection decision should be driven by forecasted equipment utilization. With a trend indicating lower 
utilization is economical with outsourcing through Performance Based Contract (PBC), while higher 
utilization is economical using the in-house option. At the same time, the cost parity point for the inventory 
management policies under investigation can vary according to the equipment output capacity, in this case, 
the flow rate. The tools developed in this research have the potential to be extended to other industries to 
assist in strategic decision making, where operations and maintenance works are performed.

Abstract 
 
 
Benford’s Law (BL) is being used extensively in research for several purposes including for the detection of 
potential manipulations of the data to detect fraud since datasets tend to follow the Benford’s distribution when they 
occur naturally without artificial control. The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted business and non-business-
related activities. Datasets related to the pandemic are being used in many different analyses to arrive at different 
conclusions. However, the credibility of the results and conclusions depend heavily on the accuracy of the datasets. 
The COVID-19 related datasets are obvious results of intense human intervention and artificial control efforts; 
therefore, the question arises as to whether Benford’s analysis can still be used to detect anomalous datasets among 
them? This research uses several publicly available datasets and uses predictive analytics to perform the Benford’s 
analysis. The applicability of BL is first verified using a regular dataset occurred prior to the pandemic, and then 
applied on COVID-19 related datasets to test the research hypothesis.  The results demonstrate that even the datasets 
with sufficiently large sample sizes with considerable human intervention and artificial control follow the Benford’s 
distribution and that Benford’s analysis can still detect the  anomalous datasets. The findings are anticipated to be 
useful for the data analysts and researchers and adds to the current literature gap. This paper may also serve as a class 
case study for the academia teaching data analytics.

1. Introduction 
 
According to Lee et al., (2020), Benford’s Law (BL) is an empirically discovered pattern for the frequency 
distribution of first digits in many real-life datasets including forensic analysis for potential manipulations of the data 
to detect fraud; applied to genome data; the half-lives of unstable nuclei; self-reported toxic emissions data; tax 
auditing; accounting; election data; stock markets; regression coefficients; inflation data; World Wide Web; religions;  
birth data; river data; first letter words; elementary particle; decay rates; and astrophysical measurements. According 
to Kraus et al. (2014), BL may be categorized as a descriptive data mining method, as it discriminates data, but also 
as predictive, as it identifies characteristics of datasets that may help to predict future schemas. Further, the authors 
mention that the applicability of the law is verified, but also controversially discussed in numerous papers. By 
observing the literature, it is obvious that the BL is applied in multiple research. According to Nigrini (1999), 
Benford’s analysis might be helpful within the supply chain processes for estimations in the general ledger; the relative 
size of inventory unit prices among locations; check for duplicate payments; and check on customer refunds. Gauvrit 
et al. (2017) state various different applications of the law such as the distance between earth and known stars, crime 
statistics, the number of daily-recorded religious activities, earthquake depths, financial variables, study of gambling 
behaviors, and brain activity recordings. It is also important to note that the BL is very much applied as a fraud

1143","6. Conclusion 
 
This study was conducted to answer the questions on “Do pandemic related datasets with high artificial 
control still follow the Benford’s law?” The study used several datasets, all >100 in sample size from several data 
sources. The findings suggest that any dataset with reasonably big enough sample size both  with or without human 
intervention, obey the BL, and that Benford’s analysis can be used to identify anomalous datasets. The conformity 
can be visualized using graphs, and verified using statistical tests, and this study used the Chi-square and the Kupier 
tests. One of the post COVID-19 datasets failed both tests, and when its graph for the observed % of first digit vs the 
expected % in Benford’s was observed, this non-conformity was apparent because the distribution was not following 
the expected shape of an exponential curve.  
 
 
As per Todter (2009), the BL is a potentially useful instrument to discover fraud and manipulation, however 
there may be many plausible reasons for deviations from the BL, such as insufficient variability of the underlying 
data, rounding effects or other irregularities (Kraus and Valverde, 2014). According to Kraus and Valverde (2014), 
supply chain data as well as other data requires a detailed business know how for interpreting to prevent 
misinterpretations. Gaining insight into data requires careful extraction, presenting of information in a meaningful 
way, and the transformation of findings into actionable insights (Gole and Shiralkar, 2020). Therefore, the red flag 
raised from Benford’s analysis is another strong signal that caution should be practiced before making use of this 
dataset further. It is suggested in literature that any red-flags such as this should follow the ‘trust-but-verify’ approach 
before making conclusions. According to Koch, & Okamura (2020), the media frequently claim that the Chinese 
government has understated the numbers of those affected, and that it can be because the data sharing practices China 
had at the early stages of the pandemic were inadequate since they were affected first. The authors further state that 
the Chinese government was unable to test those who did not present at hospitals, and the testing capacities were 
limited. The results of this study showing anomaly in Chinese data therefore is justified, and it is clear that by applying 
BL on any dataset of reasonable size, presence of anomaly and irregularities can be identified. 
 
 
This study demonstrated the procedure to detect potential data anomalies using SAP Predictive Analytics 
tools. Since the process is simple, effective, and quick for the supply chain managers or auditors to detect red flags in 
their supply chain big data, they can follow in-depth to detect anomalies including fraud. The findings will support 
the managers/auditors with their preventive measures and/or the formulation of organizational policies. As it is more 
efficient to run the checks and store the results in the cloud with SAP Expert Analytics, analysts can perform more 
frequent checks on big data from the business world. While this article adds to the current lacuna in literature in this 
field, it may also be utilized as an SAP analytics software training guideline. Since the procedure is well detailed, and 
the dataset is openly accessible, the supply chain academia may use this as one of the class case studies. 
 
 
More future research on effective sample sizes, and a clear taxonomy may help the generation of a clear set 
of guidelines for organizations to apply the BL. Such initiative can help the organizations to avoid the unnecessary 
investigations and expenditure on ‘false-alarms’. With Benford’s analysis becoming more common in fraud detection, 
new complementary analyses are already introduced making it more difficult, even for informed swindlers 
intentionally conforming to the law to remain undetected (Gauvrit et al., 2017). These complementary analyses are  
also  a another area generating more future research.

Abstract  
 
Several studies reflect that, human related challenges are heavily impacting the successful lean implementation in the 
construction industry. Hence, overcoming the human related challenges is one of the most prominent considerations 
to successfully implement lean concept in construction industry. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is to investigate 
the human related challenges and strategies to overcome those challenges for successful implementation of lean 
concept in large-scale contractors in Sri Lankan construction industry. The qualitative research approach was 
followed, while case studies were selected as the research strategy. Data was collected through in-depth interviews 
with fifteen respondents from three case studies and analysed using code-based content analysis with N-vivo 12 
software. The study identified issues in human attitudes, unfamiliar with the new concepts, lack of knowledge, lack 
of commitment, unwillingness to adopt new culture, lack of communication, lack of networking and collaboration, 
lack of committed leadership as few of the key challenges for unskilled, craft, administrative & professional, and 
managerial level employees. Among the identified key strategies, introduce new rules and regulations, provide training 
and motivation, conduct CPD and workshops on lean, enhance communication circle and provide lean performance-
based promotions for unskilled, craft, administrative, and professional & managerial categories can be highlighted.

1. Introduction  
Lean Construction (LC) is one of the best practices and a management principle, which has been borrowed from the 
Toyota automobile production system in order to seek the waste minimisation, effort maximisation, and guaranteeing 
value for money to clients or end users (Dallasega et al. 2018). Koskela (1992), one of the masterminds in LC research, 
stated that lean concept is undoubtedly beneficial in both long and short term for industry practitioners to execute 
construction projects more efficiently and effectively. Major benefits of using LC include reduction of construction 
cost, increase of the construction site safety, improvement of the quality of construction, reduction of project duration, 
diminishing of environmental impacts, increase of the productivity and customer satisfaction, and enhancement of the 
sustainable development idea of the project (Sarhan et al. 2018; Babalola et al. 2019; Aziz & Hafez, 2013).  
 
The implementation of lean in construction industry is not free from challenges. The construction industry worldwide 
is struggling in lean implementation due to several challenges irrespective of the economic status of the particular 
country. This fact is evident by the considerable number of research studies in several developed, developing and 
under developed countries across the world. Sarhan and Fox (2013) have found that lack of lean awareness and 
understanding, lack of top management commitment, time and commercial pressure, new cultures and human 
attitudinal issues as key challenges for successful lean implementation in the context of United Kingdom. Shang and 
Pheng (2014) identified the absence of a lean culture in Chinese organisations as one of the most crucial challenges 
to implement lean concept in their construction industry, while revealing six underlying factors that hinder the lean 
implementation as, (a) people and partner issues, (b) managerial and organizational issues, (c) lack of support issues, 
(d) culture and philosophy issues, (e) government issues, and (f) procurement issues. The challenges to implement 
successful LC in developing countries have also been found similar as to the developed countries namely lack of 
management commitment, limited awareness on lean concept, inadequate awareness and unwillingness to adopt to 
the lean culture (Abdullah et al. 2009). When considering under developed countries, Bajjou and Chafi (2018) have

1164","human related challenges. The same results were obtained for the administrative and professional & managerial levels. 
Accordingly, the similar human related challenges have been identified and significant challenges for professional 
and managerial level employees have been indicated in the model namely “lack of committed leadership”. Moreover, 
the strategies to overcome each human related challenge for the unskilled, craft level workers administrative and 
professional & managerial level employees are clearly indicated within the model.  
 
6. Conclusions  
LC implementation of large-scale contractors in Sri Lanka is still in the infant stage due to several reasons. More 
importantly, LC is not seeming to be rigidly implementing within the large-scale contractors of Sri Lanka due to the 
challenges impacting the successful implementation. Among those, human related challenges are carrying a significant 
impact towards the successful LC implementation of large-scale contractors in Sri Lankan construction industry. This 
study assessed number of human related challenges to the successful implementation of LC from and extensive 
literature review and identified several human related challenges in the global context and as well the strategies to 
overcome those challenges. Later, due to the identified need of investigating human related challenges and strategies 
to overcome the challenges in successful implementation of LC of large-scale contractors in Sri Lankan construction 
industry, a case study approach was conducted.  
Accordingly, human related challenges have been identified with respect to the unskilled, craft, administrative, and 
professional & managerial level employees. Issues in human attitudes, unfamiliarity in new concepts, lack of 
knowledge, lack of commitment, unwillingness to adopt new culture, lack of communication, and poor house-keeping 
have been identified as human related challenges of unskilled levels workers. In addition to the aforementioned 
challenges, lack of team work and lack of self-confidence are the human related challenges identified in the craft level 
workers. When considering the administrative and professional & managerial level employees, issues in human 
attitudes, lack of knowledge, lack of awareness and understanding, lack of commitment, lack of interest in new 
concepts, and lack of networking & collaboration have been identified as human related challenges. Further, lack of 
committed leadership has been identified as a human related challenge significantly to the professional & managerial 
level employees. Finally, the strategies to overcome the human related challenges were identified to successfully 
implement LC in unskilled, craft, administrative, and professional & managerial level employees. Introduce new rules 
and regulations, providing on the job training, conducting motivational programs, providing welfare facilities, 
conducting on-site meetings, and maintaining proper house-keeping are some of the key strategies that have been 
proposed for unskilled and craft level workers. Additionally, the open-door policy, giving recognition and appreciating 
the opinions are the particularly highlighted strategies only for craft level workers. Conducting training programs, 
workshops on LC, introducing allowance system, provide promotions, show long term benefits, conducting CPD, 
promote self-learning and enhancing communication circles are the specified strategies for administrative and 
professional and managerial level employees. In addition to that, the importance of conducting motivational programs 
have been highlighted for professional and managerial level employees. However, the strategies that have been 
proposed in this study are limited to the organisational level of large-scale contractors in Sri Lanka. 
The study has finally developed a model by mapping the strategies against the human related challenges. The 
developed model in this study will guide the large-scale contractors to identify the human related challenges impacting 
successful LC implementation and strategies to overcome those challenges. The findings of this study will be 
beneficial and applicable to the large-scale contractors in Sri Lankan construction industry as well as the contractors 
in the developing countries, those who have shared the same kind of practices, standards and socio-economic, 
demographic or cultural traits. This study mainly contributes to understand the human related challenges that are 
facing by large-scale contractors in the lean implementation and propose possible strategies that can be implemented 
within the organisation to avoid the aforementioned challenges. Further, the study will pave the way for further 
research to propose the strategies that can be used by the individuals, industry and the government to overcome the 
human related challenges in successful implementation of lean concept in construction industry.

Abstract 
 
Maintaining brand equity is a key business strategy to increase market share. This paper wants to analyze the extent 
to which brand awareness, perceived quality, brand loyalty affects brand equity in a multinational company, namely 
Starbucks Co. The data analyzed consisted of 298 respondents who lived in the Jakarta area and outside the Jakarta 
area of Indonesia. Through statistical testing on data collected with Stata Release 15 Software, it proves that the data 
is reliable and valid. The methodology used is an econometric approach with multiple regression equation models 
with robustness requirements. The calculation result proves that the model is robust, and all selected variables have a 
significant effect on the 5% degrees of freedom. The results of this study suggest that maintaining brand equity must 
be influenced by consumer’s brand awareness, perceived quality, and brand loyalty.

Abstract 
 
The World Bank reported that in 2018, there were around 7.9 million mobile cellular subscriptions in the world. 
Mobile cellular subscription grows rapidly. The growth of mobile cellular subscription follows a power model with a 
very large magnitude. This study aims to investigate economic factors of mobile cellular subscription growth. The 
data from the World Development Indicators of the World Bank were used in the study, covering 260 countries during 
2005–2017. The dependent variable was the number of mobile cellular subscription and the independent variables 
were access to electricity and automated teller machines (ATMs). These two independent variables were used as 
proxies of economic development factors. The analysis used panel data empoloying the fixed effects model. The 
results of the study show that an increase of one percent in population access to electricity was associated with an 
increase of around 806,856 mobile cellular subscriptions in the world. Meanwhile, an increase of one ATM per 
100,000 adults was associated with an increase of around 969,049 mobile cellular subscriptions in the world. These 
results imply the importance of economic development through access to electricity and ATM to improve mobile 
cellular subscription for better development.

1. Introduction 
Information and communication technology (ICT) has been an important part of human life and affects all people. It 
influences almost all parts of life not only economic aspects. Rajagukguk (2020c) studied an analysis of the impacts 
of ICT on transportation, on agricultural industry (Rajagukguk 2020b), and on world trade (Rajagukguk 2016a).  
Meanwhile, Samosir (2016) studied the impacts of ICT on economic growth, Samosir et al. (2020) examined the 
relationship between ICT and contraceptive discontinuation, and Samosir and Rajagukguk (2017) investigated the 
association between ICT and regional competitiveness. Further, Edquist et al. (2018) carried out a study based on 
panel data from 135 countries during 2002–2014. They found that ICT, in particular mobile broadband, had positive 
impacts on economic growth. An increase of 10% in mobile broadband was associated with an increase of GDP by 
0.8%.

level. After controlling for the effects of other factors, an increase of 1 ATM per 100,000 adults was associated with 
an increase of 0.168 mobile cellular subscriptions per 100 people. 
 
In addition, time also affects mobile cellular subscription. During the study period there was an increase of 4.4 mobile 
cellular subscriptions per 100 people every year. It means that there will be more people with mobile cellular 
subscriptions in the future.

3. Conclusions and recommendation 
The results of this study show that mobile cellular subscription will continue to increase. In addition, the results of 
this study supports the findings from the previous studies on the importance of economic development, electrification, 
and ATMs on mobile cellular subscription (e.g. Edquist et al. 2018; Wood 2006; Ganeshkumaran & Balamurugan 
2018). GDP per capita, electrification, and ATMs had positive effects on mobile cellular subscription. Therefore, it is 
recommended that government of countries should enhance the achievement of economic development, access to 
electrification, and availability of ATMs to foster access to mobile cellular subscription in order to promote the 
improvement of the people’s welfare in their country and to achieve the sustainable development goals.

Abstract 
 
As the difficult period, we have just been through, witnesses, resilience is needed now more than ever. Within this 
context, regulatory resilience is addressed through a case study. In fact, parallel imports and counterfeiting may have 
a strong negative impact on sales volume, turnover, and hence on business performance. In order to prevent this, a 
resilience process aiming to deal with those illegal activities is implemented, and the automation of this process by 
setting up a software solution named R2APID (Regulatory Resilience Against Parallel Imports and Doctoring) is 
explained in this paper.

1. Introduction 
The cosmetics industry, as all other business sectors, is facing a complex and ever-changing world. The new 
technologies, the increasing digitization of society, and the challenges of customer experience and sustainability have 
heavily shaken up the business model of beauty corporations and created a real need to transform the entire value 
chain: R&D, human resources, IT, marketing, manufacturing, and supply chain, which is a strategic area and a business 
driver. In order to maintain this important role and help the company to continue having a competitive advantage in 
the market, Supply chain needs to undergo a transformation that focuses on defining new operating models adapted 
to the new distribution channels (e-commerce, retail…) and integrating new technologies. An example of supply chain 
transformation program of one of the worldwide largest enterprises in the cosmetic sector shows that seven pillars are 
considered essential parts of the supply chain transformation framework. We are talking about (1) consumer driven 
customer care (consumer satisfaction is the new product performance), (2) D2C (Direct to consumer) excellence 
(Develop and optimize direct e-commerce and retail supply chain in order to reduce time to market and gain consumer 
satisfaction), (3) Omnichannel network design (Enhance flexibility and agility in the distribution centers, be fully 
compliant with regulation, provide end-to-end traceability of all products sold, and possess a true human expertise 
worldwide in warehousing and transportation), (4) Smart data (Data availability and usability), (5) Demand driven 
S&OP (Sales and operations planning) (Industrial agility, Demand sensing (Insight data, sell out, machine learning)), 
(6) New supply chain segmentation (Lean operations (Mass production), adaptive supply chain (B2B customer 
proximity), fast supply (adapt quick to demand), light processes (minimal structures and operations)), (7) Agile end 
to end operations. As is clear, this transformation seeks to promote agility as a key survival method of working. 
However, although the response of an agile supply chain to the threats of the business environment will be quick and 
effective, the negative long-term impact of the resulting disruptions cannot be eradicated in the absence of resilience 
capabilities (Lenort and Wicher 2012). In order to be able to bounce back from a disruption (risks related to processes

5. Conclusion 
The present paper consists of a case study of the supply chain transformation imposed by the VUCA (Volatile, 
Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) environment in which the company concerned operates. Following an in-depth 
analysis, the importance of ensuring regulatory resilience has been stressed. In this respect, a list of the different 
regulatory concerns faced by the company, and which may slow down the supply chain performance and threaten its 
functioning, has been drawn up. Then, a resilience process, serving the purpose of limiting parallel imports and 
counterfeiting, recognized as amongst the most threatening regulatory challenges, has been proposed. Lastly, an IT 
tool called R2APID (Regulatory Resilience Against Parallel Imports and Doctoring) and which automating the 
resilience process previously mentioned, has been introduced. In our future work, we will try to dip into other types 
of resilience in order to help with optimizing process management in general.

Abstract  
 
The pandemic has changed the hospitality business globally. There are business opportunities during the 
COVID-19 pandemic with new-normal adaptations for the sustainability of the hotel industry, which is very 
important to be explored in Bengkulu. This study aims to find out how the industry takes advantage of the 
new-normal opportunities from the policies made by the government in the hotel business sector in 
Bengkulu City during the COVID-19 pandemic. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative 
method with data collection techniques of observation, interviews, literature study also interpret and 
describe existing data concerning the current situation. Primary data was collected through interviews by 
applying standard and operational COVID-19 to city hotels in Bengkulu which were selected using 
purposive sampling to ensure that they knew and understood the cases studied, and secondary data were 
collected from online publications. The results of the study also use validation of the responses of hotel 
guests visiting from online reviews made about how business hotel operations follow the standard COVID-
19 protocol by wearing masks, washing hands where they are available, and maintaining distance.

1. Introduction 
Pandemic COVID-19 has made a worldwide tourism activity paralyzed included in the city of Bengkulu. The regulation 
for large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) from Governor of Bengkulu number 22nd the year 2020 that concerning the 
application of discipline and enforcement of health protocol laws as an effort to prevent and control coronavirus disease 
(Govenor, 2020). The impact was huge to the hotel business that required to temporarily close down the business from 
April to June 2020 (Kominfo, 2020). The impact has caused the decline of the occupancy rate of the hotel rooms to 
continue their business activities due to decreased interest and purchasing power of hotel business customers

An online review can help the continuity of the hotel business in a crisis pandemic to adapt to existing policies (Hu & 
Chen, 2016). This is a form of response to business continuity with an unpredictable nature of incidents, which can 
result in unprecedented results that cannot be predicted in the end. customer review requirements can create strategy 
formulations at a rapid rate to address or reduce the effects of threats. In this study, researchers analyzed guest reviews 
of the three research objects 3–4-star city hotels in the city of Bengkulu are Santika Bengkulu, Sinar Sport Hotel 
Bengkulu, and Mercure Bengkulu. 
Table. 3 describes the results of calculating the satisfaction and dissatisfaction measurement of guest reviews in nominal 
and percentage form as well as overall ratings which are then used as data in this study. Based on the TripAdvisor 
platform, the Sinar Sport hotel received 170 reviews, which are divided into 111 satisfied or around 99.1% and 1 or 
0.9% dissatisfaction while obtained and 4.5 / 5 overall rating. While Santika has a total of 121 reviews divided into 21 
satisfied or 91.5% satisfaction reviews and 2 or 8.6% dissatisfaction reviews and an overall rating of 4.0 / 5. Therefore, 
Mercure Bengkulu has 17 total reviews with 9 or 100 % satisfied reviews and 0 or 0% dissatisfied reviews with an 
overall rating of 4.5/5. 
The online review of customer satisfaction for city hotels in Bengkulu city based on data on TripAdvisor showed that 
a satisfactory rating was 96.3% although the situation during the pandemic COVID-19 with new-normal conditions 
and standard protocol applied. The result describes that during the pandemic crisis customer was able to support the 
business continuity during the pandemic crisis in hotel Bengkulu City while encouraging the reviewer based on the 
experience. The positive feedback during the pandemic allowing the researcher to estimate that the new adaptation 
model and the implementation of SOP were excellent and created the best level of satisfaction toward the pandemic 
conditions. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the above discussion and the results of research conducted by the author, it can be concluded that at this time 
the impact of the spread of the coronavirus or COVID-19 is strongly felt by the public, including by operators in 
Indonesia. The WHO and the government in the implementation of social distancing changing the culture of today's 
society and are also negatively impacting the business continuity of each company, especially in Bengkulu City. The 
COVID-19 crisis condition requires the cooperation of all stakeholders to be able to effectively manage this public 
health emergency, especially the hospitality world which has been very critically affected. Governments, the hotel 
industry, universities, citizens, and the media to stem the spread of the virus, help patients and fight an economic 
collapse that has yet to show its end. This requires a series of strategies on existing opportunities consistently through 
Product, Price, Promotion and the process must adopt new-normal based on SOP and be customer-centric.  
 
Accordingly, the online review was able to provide a benchmark based on customer experience to forecast the hotel 
services without direct contact. Although it was critical to be applied for hotel business in the city of Bengkulu the 
control of stakeholders should be evaluated to maximize the opportunity through operation safely and comfortably

continuity, one of which is by making an effective marketing strategy in this era of COVID-19. Recommendations for 
further research are the opportunity and challenges for the application of the COVID-19 standard for new normal 
adoption in Indonesia.

Contract Manufacturing in the Consumer Products Supply 
Chain in South Africa: A Review

Abstract 
 
Manufacturing remains a critical driver for economic development in developing countries. Outsourcing of 
production to contract manufacturers companies (CMCs) is a global phenomenon that has gained prominence 
in the last three decades in the electronics and pharmaceutical products supply chains and has extended to the 
consumer products supply chain. Significant literature on manufacturing outsourcing and contract 
manufacturing and their role in the supply chain is available. However, there is very little scholarship on the 
critical factors that make CMCs sustainable businesses and important links in the consumer products supply 
chain, and what frameworks are available to assist the CMCs identify and put into practice these critical 
success factors, (CSFs). This study aims to fill this gap by identifying, through research, the factors that are 
critical for CMCs to be sustainable businesses that can contribute to the success of their clients and the 
economy. A sustainability framework will be developed from these CFCs, which will be tested in selected 
CMCs in South Africa. This framework will assist customers of CMCs to select and appoint the best CMC 
partner to work with and provide a roadmap for existing and aspiring CMCs to build organisations with the 
systems for success and sustainability.

1. Introduction 
Manufacturing has traditionally played a key role in the economic development of developing countries.  It is now well 
established in the economic growth and development literature that there is a strong causal relationship between the 
growth of manufacturing output and the growth of gross domestic product (GDP), particularly in developing countries, 
with scholars and researchers mostly upholding Kalder’s theory that manufacturing is the engine for growth after 
conducting research in both the developing and developed countries all over the world (Alexion and Tsaliki, 2010; 
Olamide and Oni, 2016; Pacheco-Lopez and Thirlwall, 2013; Szirmai, 2012; Tsoku et al, 2017;) . As was the case in the 
last millennium, industrialization has continued to play a key role in the growth of developing countries, which have 
sustained rapid and long-term growth for the last 25 years (Moyo and Jeke, 2019). Achieving economic development 
by following the path of industrialization will likely remain important for low-income countries (Haraguchi et al, 2017). 
Globalisation has created new opportunities and competitive advantages, forcing producers to seek more efficient ways 
to make their products. It has become increasingly common for producers seeking more efficient means of production 
to divide the traditional vertically integrated model into stages or tasks, thus allowing them to outsource part or all of 
their production processes (Kamal et al, 2015), even to different countries. This therefore means there is a good 
opportunity for local manufacturing companies to set themselves as outsourced manufacturing partners for the local and 
global brand owners.  The question this study aims to answer is “how does a potential provider of outsourced 
manufacturing services become a successful and sustainable business and a critical member of the supply chain?”. 
 
2. Research Methodology 
The study starts with a review of literature to gather and analyse the wide range of studies and publications previously 
conducted on production/ manufacturing outsourcing and critical success factor frameworks for sustainability in contract 
manufacturing companies to come up with empirical evidence on the research area.  Because of the limited literature on 
frameworks for CMCs the literature review was expanded to include literature on CSFs, frameworks and challenges in 
outsourced manufacturing, contract manufacturing, toll manufacturing, world class manufacturing, manufacturing

C- CMCs must have a clear manufacturing strategy that enables to them to fully focus on manufacturing as 
their core competence and make this into a sustainable business. The leadership of the CMC develops 
performance metrics with leading indicators that enables it to control their processes.  
- 
D - Technology plays a key role in effective operations and communication in a CMC and so is a critical to the 
success of the company. 
 
Based on this literature survey and the factors that emerged below is a proposed framework that captures all these 
identified CSFs that can be applied to CMCs. 
 
6. Proposed Framework for Implementing CSFs in CMCs 
From the CSFs emerging from the literature review, the following framework for success and sustainability of CMCs is 
proposed: 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Framework for Successful and Sustainable Contract Manufacturing 
 
7. Conclusion and Further Work 
Given that there is limited scholarship on such an important topic as the critical success factors for sustainability in 
CMCs, which play a very critical role in global supply chains and industrialising economies through increased 
manufacturing activity, there is an obvious need to take this study further and survey existing CMCs and their customers 
in the consumer products supply chain in South Africa so that the framework can be further improved and developed 
into an implementation model. This model will then be tested through implementation in existing CMCs.

Abstract  
Developing human factors at the emotional and cognitive levels is significantly vital to project success. The notion of 
emotional intelligence is growingly gaining attention, and studies on this field are being performed increasingly. Yet, 
the studies that have been conducted in projects in the United Arab Emirates are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to 
shed light on the emotional intelligence level within decision-makers (project managers and engineers specifically) 
who are currently operating projects in the UAE, specifically, the field of construction and information technology 
(IT), and how far it contributes to project success. A questionnaire has been prepared for data collection. It consists of 
a section that measures EI among respondents and another section measuring project success. A total of 106 responses 
across the United Arab Emirates were collected from project managers and project engineers working in 
construction/IT firms and analyzed using IBM’s SPSS v26 software package. Our results showed that PMEs in the 
UAE have a high level of emotional intelligence and EI is strongly correlated to project success. We observed that 
PMEs in the UAE prefer to intermingle with people of the same culture, as suggested by the results of the hypothesis 
testing. Since emotional intelligence was indeed a contributor to project success, it is suggested that employers should 
pay more attention to developing their employees’ EI level, as well as prioritize candidates with high levels of EI 
during the recruiting process.

1. Introduction 
Project success is always considered the ultimate objective in every organization; whether it is meeting a certain 
deadline or budget, the success of a project is crucial to sustaining the business. One of the critical factors that play a 
role in the success of a project is the project manager (PM). Kappelman et al. (2006) pointed out that a weak project 
manager ranks third among 53 other project failure factors. Studies point out that poorly planned and dreadfully 
managed enormous projects are more susceptible to failure. The same goes for massive projects directed by an 
unqualified director (Pan et al. 2008). Indeed, a project manager plays a crucial role in the project's success, given that 
he or she has acquired a multiskilled set of characteristics and adjustable techniques to guide a track to a successful

1218","(H1a) was found to be 0.029, which is less than the significant level (α = 0.05), which means that we should reject the 
null hypothesis and conclude that culture actually plays a role in people intermingling with each other. Furthermore, 
to see who people actually prefer to intermingle with, a two-tailed Wilcoxon test was performed to test (H1b), and the 
p-value was 0.016, meaning that the null hypothesis should be rejected and conclude that people prefer to intermingle 
with people of their own culture. (H2) was formulated to test the responses of the people of culture A, the p-value was 
0.917 (> α = 0.05), meaning that we should accept the null hypothesis and conclude that the people from of culture A 
intermingle the same between people of their own culture, as well as people from other cultures. (H3) was formulated 
to test the responses of the people of culture B. The p-value was 0.478 (> α = 0.05), which means that the null 
hypothesis shall be accepted and conclude that the people of culture B intermingle the same between people of their 
own culture and people from other cultures. (H4a) was formulated to test the responses of the people of culture C. 
The p-value was 0.020 (< α = 0.05), which means that the null hypothesis shall be rejected and conclude that the 
people of culture C do not intermingle the same between people of their own culture and people from other cultures. 
To investigate further, (H4b) was formulated and resulted of a p-value of 0.014 (< α = 0.05), meaning that that the 
null hypothesis shall be rejected and conclude that the people of culture C prefer to intermingle with people of their 
own culture. This situation could be attributed to them usually working only with people of the same culture and 
having most of their colleagues being of the same culture.   
 
6. Conclusion  
In this research, the level of emotional intelligence among project managers and project engineers (and employees 
with related occupations) working in a project-based environment in the United Arab was measured and concluded 
that the participants indeed had a high level of emotional intelligence. This could be attributed to training and human 
development programs that have been arranged and prepared by the human resources departments of the respected 
participants’ employers. Another reason could be that organizations in the past few years are recruiting and employing 
people who are PMP© and PRINCE2© certified (or hold any related certificate to the field of project management) 
and the increasing number of managers and engineers holding these certificates. It was also concluded that emotional 
intelligence is significantly correlated with project success, as shown by the bivariate correlation and linear regression 
model coefficients of emotional intelligence variables, which is in parallel with the results of previous studies that 
examined the impact of emotional intelligence and project success (Rezvani et al. 2016; Müller and Turner, 2007; 
Maqbool et al. 2017; Geoghegan and Dulewicz, 2008). This research provides underpinning evidence to support the 
hypothesis of the impact of emotional intelligence on project success. Project managers and project engineers with 
higher emotional intelligence understand the emotions of themselves and of others, exhibit accurate self-assessment 
and trustworthiness in the workplace, sense others’ feelings and development needs and bolster their abilities. These 
traits were found to contribute to the project’s success and are significantly correlated to it. The arguments presented 
in this research suggested that emotional intelligence impacts project success, meaning that the project’s success 
depends on soft skills as much as it depends on hard skills. It was also found that people who work in project-based 
organizations across the United Arab Emirates do not intermingle the same between people of their own culture and 
people of other cultures. Further investigation in the dataset revealed that people prefer to deal with people of their 
own culture overall. This might be attributed to the communication barrier since it is always easier to communicate 
with people speaking the same language. It could also be contributed to the interpretation and comprehension of 
emotions by different cultures, as suggested by the work of Eid & Diener (2009) and Wierzbicka (1986), people of 
different nations and cultures use different structures of emotion terms, which are likely to reflect dissimilar ways of 
experiencing and conceptualizing emotions. The work presented in this research aims to eliminate the gap mentioned 
in chapter 2 and point out the importance of emotional intelligence in project-based organizations, which allows 
project managers and project engineers to consider other aspects of project success factors. Additionally, it urges 
PMEs to assess their emotional intelligence level to take corrective measures and employers to recruit PMEs with 
higher emotional quotients (EQ). Furthermore, it encourages researchers to expand the domain of future studies of the 
same nature to include wider regions such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) or the Middle East.

Abstract 
 
RFID for Radio Frequency Identification represents an automated data-capture technology that evolved during the 
90’s 20th centuries (Qiwei 2007). It is an effective way to identify traceable objects and is widely applied in many 
domains (such as Healthcare Applications, SCM, Sensing Applications, Transportation, IoT Applications ...). The 
Internet of Things (IoT) is a global infrastructure for the information society based on a heterogeneous set of 
subsystems and technologies that need to be interconnected and interfaced in real-time with each other by following 
suitable standards for communication, integration, measurement, control and interoperability (Rouchdi et al. 2018). 
Of the interoperable solutions, the middleware is worth mentioning. In the IoT, RFID middleware is the software 
chain's brain that gives intelligence to the collected data from RFID-tagged objects, it represents a technical software 
layer that acts as an interface between the various IT applications and the RFID equipment network whose role is to 
manage the hardware network, deduplicating redundant information, aggregation, dissemination, and formatting of 
RFID data (Ajana et al. 2009). This work presents an RBAC and NoSQL based RFID software framework whose goal 
is to increase security by making the authentication process much more efficient. This new middleware architecture 
enables the monitoring, processing and storing of a large volume of incoming RFID events flow in real-time by 
combining RFID technology with MongoDB and provides enhanced interoperability through the option of presenting 
RFID data in JSON format.

1. Introduction 
The acronym RFID represents a type of Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) (Ishikawa et al. 2003); in 
other words, it stands for all technologies that use radio waves for identification purposes. This technology utilizes 
radio waves to retrieve the data stored in equipment named RFID tags to automatically identify and detect target 
(items, people, or other objects) (Haibi et al. 2018). This technology has contributed to developing a wide range of 
domains, such as complex environments, access control, sensing applications, and other fields. RFID technology, 
compared with the barcode-based systems, brings additional benefits; it has the advantages of higher storage capacity, 
reading various labels simultaneously, and quick identification. The RFID system is made up of four components: 
RFID tags, RFID reader, business applications plus a software layer named RFID middleware. 
 
For large-scale or complex RFID solutions, RFID middleware has a crucial role in interfacing business management 
modules with data from RFID tags. This work focuses on the software parts by proposing a new architecture of data 
acquisition and processing platform. The middleware will ensure the interface between the collected data (contained 
in the RFID tags memory) and the company management software exploiting these data; it ensures the extraction of 
RFID data from the readers, it also allows filtering the data, aggregating them and transmitting them after distillation 
to the enterprise information systems. From the scientific literature, we note that, in general, a limited number of 
research works have proposed traceability solutions designed for huge volumes of RFID events processing, acquisition 
and storage in real-time. Rouchdi et al. (2018) present a proposal for a three-tier RFID middleware, which is 
advantageous in terms of security but does not allow for the analysis & processing or storage of large RFID event 
streams. In (Sahni et al. 2018), authors suggested a Middleware architecture for structural health monitoring 
application; this architecture has multiple advantages, but it cannot be integrated into RFID-based tracking solutions 
because (like the previous architecture) it does not support a large data flow nor mobile RFID objects. Bouhouche et

5. Conclusion 
In this document, we propose an RFID Middleware architecture. The proposed middleware differentiates from existing 
middleware architectures in that it can store any type of RFID data, integrates data stream processing to allow real-
time data analysis, supports massive data, and stores data in JSON format for better interoperability (Breje et al. 2018). 
It also describes two application areas for RFID technology. Such a platform allows automated and real-time tracking, 
reduced management time, real time location, reduction of the workforce. 
 
Our middleware architecture is in its first stage of development. At this phase, we have outlined the features and 
services that will be used in our future Middleware. It was found in the initial assessment study that our architecture 
can solve problems such as security, storage, large amounts of data processing, and heterogeneity. For future work, 
we plan to complete the implementation of our Middleware. This will allow us to evaluate it using a real deployment 
case to quantify the entire proposed system's performance.

Abstract  
 
This article analyses the impact of the coronavirus pandemic among Construction Small-Medium Enterprises 
(CoSMEs) in the UK. A global and UK effect context-analysis is given and contrasted using a multivariate scrutiny 
of factors determining success or failure and the extent of covariance among contributory factors leading to closure 
as well as survival of the CoSMEs.  Firstly, it reveals that within the UK, government interventional measures had a 
mixed effect. In most cases, the measures were deemed to be inadequate and too late in stopping the failure of most 
CoSMEs, though a substantial number survived due to government interventional measures such as the furlough 
schemes. Secondly, an inventory of the specific and multidimensional measures, attributed to mitigate total failure of 
CoSMEs is drawn including a review of the perceived benefits such as minimizing extent of total closure or declared 
volume of bankruptcies. Thirdly, it is observed that government decisive decisions contributed to the slowdown of the 
economy, and in particular construction activities. However, ranked among the interventional measures is the 
‘bouncebackability’ driven measures which offered a soft landing for many CoSMEs. The study concludes that crisis-
mitigating policy measures (CMPM), are necessary for the short and long-term recovery and performance of the UK 
economy. Understanding the composition of these measures and their rank order is critical to UK economic recovery.

Strategy must be in place to future proof the Construction Small-Medium Enterprises (CoSMEs) involve in 
construction by creating the culture and control mechanism among the parties involve, building on the existing policy 
and provision of adequate health and safety equipment and policy. it is necessary to see more investment in innovative 
technology that will support management of the construction process including cash flow support that will help 
cushion the effect of any delays or overrun due to any unforeseen situation cause by covid-19. This should be adapted 
to any economic dynamism faced by CoSMEs.  Any ambiguity in dealing with cases arising from pandemic should 
be made clear in the various form of contract in use to avoid any dispute or abandonment of project.

1. Introduction  
This text identifies one aspect of the unconstitutional state1 of affairs in the Republic of Colombia since 1984 to 2018, 
the internal armed conflict. In this sense the text search causalities between not registered victims by the justice service 
in the framework of this conflict and their correlation with the mortality causes and the average life time expectancy 
for each of these causes at the national level. For this, the records of the National Registry of Victims of the Armed 
conflict -RUNV a Spanish acronym- is available since 1984 to 2018 retrieved in 2019 (Unidad de Víctimas, 2019). 
Subsequently, 15 crime categories are correlated with the average life time expectancy for  each one 105 grouped 
causes of death  from 1985 to 2018, for this the central limit theorem was used over the grouped data to estimate the 
average life time expectancy to national level. , information available with annual detail.

Abstract 
 
This text uses the operational data of a financial services company in Colombia with about 10 million clients 
nationwide and with more than 50 offices in the country. With operational records for the provision of their services 
for a period of 30 months, which includes periods of 4 different calendar years. Using the ANOVA models and the 
coefficients of the associated linear regression model, the effect of the year, the week of the year, the day of the month, 
the day of the week on the arrival rates, waiting time, time in service, rate of outlet for the attention of each of the 
products. In the same way, the evolution of performance measures since the modification of the system is identified. 
Using this information, it is possible to propose changes or use data analysis schemes that identify cyclical variation 
with different time lengths and identify the evolution of changes in the working method within the organization.

The table 10 contains the p-values in the categorical ANOVA model for the selected date variables: Year, Week of 
the Year, day of the month, day of the week. There in no case is the number of the day of the month significant. Two 
other combinations are significant: the year for the number of services rendered; and the day of the week the number 
of units in inventory. Table 11 shows the information or sumof squares decomposition for each source for each 
performance measure. The sources are about the date: year (D Y); Week of the Year (D WoY); Day of Month (D 
DoM); Day of Week (D DoW). Table 12  shows the total variance decomposition : Sum of Squares Modeled, SSM, 
Sum of squares of Error, SSE; and Sum of Squares Total, SST. After of this the F statistic and  p-value of  linear 
regression model are calculated

6. Conclusion  
Week of Year Cyclicity is dominant for each performance measure. The models explains 36% to 69% of the total of 
information using all categorical variables about the date: Year, Week of year, day of Mont and Day of Week. Could 
be very useful to expand the correlation analysis with the Wavelet analysis in order to obtain simultaneity in 
frequency each time in each variable pair

Abstract  
 
This text uses public data bases about Road Accident Rate Bogotá, Colombia, 2015- 2019. Using ANOVA categorical 
Regression we found the cyclical effect for injuries and fatalities, by: day of week, week of year, and Year. Also we 
found the incidence by sub urban division

1270","5.3 Proposed Improvements  
Signal analysis, spectral decomposition techniques could be used to identify the behaviors and regularities underlying 
homicides in road accidents such as the Granger causality equations or the Signal Engineering Wavelets. 
 
5.4 Validation  
The following table contains for 8 different variables summarizes the amount of information represented and the 
contrast of assumptions for linear statistical models with categorical variables. Row Y specifies the name of the output 
variable. T is the frequency of the records used daily summaries or the database, X are the variables included. DF are 
the degrees of freedom used, R² is the proportion of information as a percentage explained by the specific model, R² 
Adj. It is the R² corrected for the degrees of freedom and the variables used, DW is the Durbin Watson statistic used 
to identify the serial correlation between the data used. The lower part has the modeled sum of squares, Model, the 
sum of squares of the Error, Error, these being the two components of the total sum of squares corrected by the mean, 
Total C. From these data the statistic is obtained F and the probability of F as a statistic for the acceptance or rejection 
of the hypothesis of the non-existence or the existence of the model. 
 
For the 8 synthesized models, it is found which 7 are statistically significant based on the p (F) statistic. All of them 
are statistically significant except for the dead model obtained per day. In any case, the data do not show a first-order 
serial correlation, thus fulfilling the assumption of independence between the data recording, since its DW statistics 
are all close to 2. The models for the injured in the daily record obtains values of R² between 0.36; 0.43 and 0.52. The 
models for the deaths based on daily records show 0.01, 0.03 and 0.07, so the statistical models, although significant 
in some cases, explain little of the variation in the data. For the models based on the records of the database, it is 
obtained that 0.00 is explained for the dead and 0.12 for the wounded.

6. Conclusion  
Statistical models are available for those injured by road accidents associated with the date of the civil calendar and 
the Minor Mayor's Office; such models explain between 36% to 63% of the information. There are no statistical 
models in the practical or empirical sense, although there are from the statistical point of view for the deaths due to 
road accidents associated with the date of the civil calendar and the Minor Mayor's Office; such models explain 
between 0% and 3% of the information. There is no homogeneity in the homicide event in a road accident. Other 
models could be used such as acoustic or electronic signal analysis to capture frequencies and periods of common 
occurrence.

Abstract 
 
Security services offer depends on the demand of that services. The changes of homicides across time affects the 
amount of resources required to offer security services. The planning and control of police services operation can be 
characterized through fixed and variable components for many geographical areas. In this text, cyclical components 
are identified since 2010 to 2020 for the criminal murder identification by police force corps. To accomplish that it is 
used open source or public information from information system SIEDCO offered by the Colombian National Police. 
Then it is used a regression model with categorical variables for this data base over dates and quantities from a national 
criminal murder point of view. From these models coefficients are obtained for the year and week of the facts.

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
Its proposed expand this work by subnational data to observe each particular dynamyc link between National Murder 
Police Database and time dimension. In order to obtain a correlation with economic activity these variables could be 
linked with others of economic activity. Wavelet coefficients and, and granger causality could also be used for the 
study of this access as signals and editing with the detail of the daily information that is available. 
 
5.4 Validation  
Table 3 to table 8 contains inferential procedures to validate these coefficients for each model, sub dimension about 
time variable and uses kurtosis and skewness coefficients, in order to decompose the bias or to decompose the 
variance in their sources   
 
6. Conclusion  
It is found out that time factors like year, week or day of the week could explain the variation of the homicides in 
Colombia. Evidence about incidence of time factors in homicides could be an insight of the presence of cycles on the 
occurrence of homicides. Spatial variable department showed to be significant in explaining homicides. That means, 
geography has a major impact in the presence of homicides.

Abstract  
 
Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) enables mobile nodes to communicate with each other through wireless 
connections without any centralized controller or base station. Each mobile node is powered by a battery. The efficient 
use of battery energy is, therefore, a key factor in MANET. Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) uses a 
Multipoint Relay (MPR) selection method to reduce transmitted packets during the flooding process. In the OLSR 
protocol, a MPR set is selected based on reachability and degree. It fails to consider the energy constraints of the 
network As a result, we have focused on reducing energy consumption. This paper introduces a new mechanism for 
selecting the MPR in the OLSR protocol, in order to enhance energy management and prolong the network lifetime 
based on the willingness without losses of performances (such as MPRs count, The Number of Dead Nodes, end-to-
end delay, control overhead, packet loss). Simulation results using Ns-3 while varying numbers of nodes show that 
our proposed EEM-OLSR protocol outperforms the classic OLSR by significantly improving the network lifetime.

1. Introduction  
The wide range of applications supported by ad hoc mobile networks explains the popularity of this form of network. 
These applications cover different domains, such as environmental monitoring, wildlife protection, emergency rescue, 
home monitoring, target tracking, bridge structural health, military activities. Mobile nodes are characterized by small 
size, advanced communication technologies, but also a limited amount of energy. This energy may be very costly to 
regenerate. In order to optimize network lifetime, energy-efficient strategies are needed in such networks (Yetgin et 
al. 2017), (Gupta et al. 2015). 
 
Solutions to maximize network lifetime can be classified into four categories (Mohamed et al. 2018), (Elshrkawey et 
al. 2018), (Selvakumar and Sankaranarayanan, 2018) some change the transmitting capacity of wireless nodes, others 
reduce the amount of information transmitted by aggregation, others allow nodes sleep to spare energy, and finally, 
the last ones use energy-efficient routing. In this paper, we have concentrated on this last category, for several reasons: 
 • A multi-hop transmission consumes energy. So reducing the energy expended on transmitting a packet from its 
source to its destination will increase the lifetime of the network (Kgotlaetsile et al. 2018). 
 •  Avoiding low-residual energy nodes will help prolong the lifetime of the network.

considerably decreases the number of packets loss. The descent in routing overhead demonstrates that the total energy 
consumed is well optimized. So, the EEM-OLSR protocol provides a low overhead routing for dense networks It 
seems that EEM-OLSR is very suitable for dense mobile ad-hoc networks. The simulation results have confirmed the 
effectiveness of our proposed protocol EEM-OLSR in terms of the QoS metrics used. As a piece of future work, it 
can compare our proposed routing protocol EEM-OLSR by using other protocols with the help of other different 
parameters in wide network size with different mobility models and check its performance.

Abstract 
 
Technology has become an integral part of education in both courses that utilize it but also as an alternative method 
of teaching. Due to the current ongoing pandemic, online learning has been skyrocketing in popularity, raising 
concerns regarding the workstation setup of preschool students and how the current designs can lead to them having 
musculoskeletal disorders and other diseases. The researchers aimed to model an ergonomically designed workstation 
that is catered specifically to preschool students from the ages four to six. This was done through a survey to identify 
the factors affecting the students’ comfortability through correlation and multiple regression analysis, along with their 
comfort levels which were evaluated using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment tool (RULA) and Corlett’s and Bishop’s 
discomfort questionnaire. The results of the correlation analysis displayed that the sitting posture (r=, seat height, and 
table height strongly affect a preschooler's discomfort while using the workstation. Additionally, the regression 
equation implies that the RULA score and seat height both add to students' discomfort, while the backrest height 
greatly reduces it for every value that was added. With the results garnered, the researchers were able to design three 
chairs and four tables that are suitable for preschool students.

1. Introduction 
Education is most effective when the learning environment of the students makes them feel connected with the 
instructor’s discussions, whether it be traditionally or non-traditionally. Technology has become an integral part of 
educational institutions; not only in courses that utilize technology, but also as an alternative on the teaching and 
learning process. Statistics show that there has been an increased necessity for alternative learning modalities, most 
especially during this pandemic, with online learning being the commonly implemented modality used by numerous 
educational institutions. However, most countries are still unprepared to shift to these alternatives; having no adequate 
equipment or services for online learning (Dhawan, 2020). The use of computers and similar gadgets continue to 
become more necessary with the shift of schools to web-based e-learning. Consequently, related equipment that eases 
the use of these gadgets has become significant; such as computer workstations, that is fundamental for enhancing the 
learning environment of the students and improving their overall performance academically (Kiran, 2020). The use of 
computer workstations has been essential for children and adults alike, as it eases the use of electronic devices for 
longer durations. A poorly designed computer workstation may bring about several work-related musculoskeletal 
disorders and injuries, with the most common of them being tendonitis, epicondylitis, tension neck syndrome, and 
carpal tunnel syndrome to name a few. Due to the lack of workstations that are designed considering these factors, 
children five years or lower end up having these musculoskeletal disorders early in their adolescence, in which their 
body continuously undergoes change (Godilano et al. 2018a).

1300","Figure 2 exhibits the four table models created by the researchers in Google Sketchup. The improvements include 
relieving discomfort for the neck, forearm, and legs by adding the ability to adjust the desk height. A low desk or a 
high desk will cause poor posture and neck pain. Besides this, along with an adjustable seat height, having an 
adjustable desk height will aid in providing comfort in the forearms and adequate space for the legs to move while 
using the workstation. Moreover, a few of these models have a tiltable desk which addresses the discomfort felt in the 
eyes and neck. A tiltable desk is an additional feature, but it greatly aids in lessening eye strain for the user, and 
decreases the risk of obtaining other visual problems. It is recommended that the desk is slightly tilted below gaze 
inclination. These improvements are added not only following the generated data from this study but also a similar 
paper by Kibria and Rafiquzzaman (2019) where the researchers detail the required ergonomic improvements along 
with modelling a chair for an ergonomic computer workstation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
With the lack of sufficient related studies on school equipment that is ergonomically designed for children aged four 
to six years old, the researchers have successfully created a model of an ergonomically designed computer workstation 
that will be of use for children within the age range. Based on the results of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) 
Scores, the researchers were able to determine the body parts that experienced the highest discomfort levels to be the 
upper back, lower back, and the shoulder. 
 
With regard to the statistical analysis of the data, it was determined that the factors which had the greatest effect on 
the discomfort levels of the respondents were the duration of study and the type of chair used, while the other factors 
that were taken into consideration had proven to not have a significant effect on the discomfort level. Moreover, the 
mismatch analysis proved that wood as a material is best suited for chairs and tables that are designed for preschoolers; 
along with those made of monobloc or plastic. It is also observed that metal as the material is highly discouraged. This 
study also indicated that the anthropometric percentiles computed for the study favored the female preschooler 
students; with its lowest dimensions consistently falling under the female anthropometric percentiles gathered. In the 
event that the parents want to set up a suitable computer workstation for their children, the design and details provided 
in this study may be used as a pattern or standard. Furthermore, this study has met the optimal design by intricately 
utilizing the recommended dimensions for both table and chair. Finally, a total of three designs for a chair were made, 
while four designs for a table was also created. Different models were designed with various features depending on 
the preference of the users that is also adjusted to their comfortability.

Abstract 
 
High school students, especially in the time of pandemic, have online classes, which requires the students to expose 
themselves to computer workstations, putting them at risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders. This study aims 
to assess and evaluate the current setup used by the students studying at home. The main objective of this study is to 
design an ergonomic workstation for high school students who are studying at home. The data that were gathered from 
the respondents (n=100) include discomfort level using Corlett’s and Bishop’s body map questionnaire, risk level of 
sitting posture using Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and anthropometric dimensions as such as popliteal 
height, sitting elbow height, buttock-popliteal depth, hip breath, sitting shoulder height and range of functional reach. 
The data that were gathered from the respondents were statistically treated and analyzed using ANOVA for mean 
comparison and correlation analysis. There were several factors that were considered in the study to determine the 
cause of body discomfort of students while using the current computer workstation in their homes while studying 
online. The factors include duration of study, area of study, chair design and table design. The study found out that 
the duration of study and the type of chair have a significant difference with the discomfort scores of students, meaning 
these factors significantly affect the discomfort level of the students while studying at home. Another finding is that 
the RULA score (r=0.854, p-value<0.001) and the table height dimension (r=0.773, p-value<0.001) have a positive 
relationship with the discomfort scores while seat height (r=-0.693, p-value<0.001) has negative relationship with 
discomfort scores of students. The study concluded that some dimensions and the duration of exposure to computer 
workstations puts high school students at higher risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders. Given these conditions, 
we have proposed an ergonomic workstation deign for students based on their gathered anthropometric measurements.

1. Introduction 
Work is defined as the dedication of mental and physical capabilities to accomplish a task (Merriam-Webster 
Dictionary, 2020). Based on the definition, the classification of academics falls under it. Educational institutions 
demand from students a huge investment of time, effort, and cognitive ability such as learning, remembering, problem-
solving, and attention (SharpBrains, 2020), with the duration of an average Philippine class being 6 and a half hours 
long worth of lessons, seatworks, and quizzes (State University, 2020). Since the year 2020, digitally speaking, is 
included in a generation called Generation Alpha, the people that currently live in such an era are preoccupied with 
the technology that is thriving (Pinsker, 2020). Consequently, the usage of computers would be frequent, as the 
National Center for Education Statistics (1999) presented 88% of computer-available teachers reporting the usage of 
computers in school facilities and the use of computers as a means of curricular instruction that may or may not also 
require the use of computers for the students’ end. Due to technological evolution from 1999-2020 and the Department

The image in Figure 2 presents a prototype design of the recommended computer workstation for the most optimal 
comfort level that satisfies the sample. The labels are the recommended dimensions per aspect of measurement of the 
chair and table. The recommended design is the most optimal design for comfort, meaning that following the 
suggestion decreases the risk of the contraction of musculoskeletal disorders for high school students using computer 
workstation setups.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The first objective of the study aimed to assess and evaluate the current setup used by students studying at home. The 
evaluation of the survey administered included pertinent information that would not only aid in the proceeding of the 
data analysis part of the research, but would also meet such objective. Further achievement was done with the used of 
the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) that investigated the posture of each respondent that translated to a scoring 
system presenting the risk of each student in contracting musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) in each part of the body. 
The findings present that the respondents’ most frequent responses for each category are male, 18 years old, 6-9 hours, 
bedroom, morning-evening, office/gaming chair, and a wooden table. The researchers concluded that the most 
frequent responses present a general idea of the computer workstation setup and the behavior using such. The second 
objective aimed to evaluate the comfortability of students in using the current set-up and identify factors affecting 
such level. The first part of the objective was achieved with the usage of the Corlett’s Bishop Discomfort Questionnaire 
which has a similar purpose with the goal targeted. The second part of the objective, on the other hand, was achieved 
with, first, the Welch's t-test that analyzed the difference between the demographics and the discomfort scores, and 
second, the correlation analysis that presented the relationship between the discomfort scores of the respondents and 
the demographics and factors gathered from the survey. The data that had a positive relationship were determined as 
factors that affected the discomfort level of the students, namely the duration of study and sitting posture while table 
height has negative relationship to the discomfort scores. The data also found out that there is a significant difference 
between the duration of study hours and the chair type with the discomfort scores. The researchers concluded that the 
duration of exposure, the amount of cushion, and the specific dimensions in a chair and a table affects the 
comfortability level of students. The final objective was designing an ergonomic workstation for students studying at 
home. The objective was obtained with the rough design of the computer workstation using the three-dimensional 
design software SketchUp wherein the dimensions in the design was in reference to the recommended dimensions of 
a chair and a table with the most optimal comfort for the high school students. The data found out that the 
recommended dimensions are within range for office/gaming, monobloc, and wooden chairs, but the wooden table is 
the only type of table that is within range. The researchers further conclude that there is a need for an ergonomic 
adjustment for the computer workstation dimensions to obtain the most optimal comfort for students.

Abstract  
 
Topology optimization plays a key role in the production of strong, lightweight functional parts. It uses mathematical 
algorithms to create optimized geometries under given constraints while at the same time improving performance. The 
conventional design process is time consuming and requires high technical expertise. The raisons d’etre for using 
algorithms is to reduce part development time and to keep the computational cost low. Further reduction in cost 
through weight savings can be realized though monolithic (one piece) design. In this method, weight reduction is 
achieved through the elimination of bolts, nuts and other joining material. Combining topology optimization with 
monolithic design also blends the benefit of weight reduction with the simplification of the assembly process. To reach 
optimum weight, an effective part development process requires a methodology which takes into account the objective 
function and all the constraints. The methodology can be used from the early stages, throughout the design process. 
This provides a step-by-step approach to the design process and keeps iterations to a minimum, thereby reducing the 
product development time. This research therefore focuses on the trends in the development of a methodology for the 
topology optimization of monolithic vehicle components. It also highlights the challenges and opportunities, placing 
emphasis on the vehicle aftermarket industry components.  
 
Keywords  
Methodology, Topology Optimization, Monolithic Components, Design. 
 
1. Introduction  
The design industry has taken great strides in technological advancement, driving almost everything from autonomous 
vehicles to aircraft parts and spaceship components. Engineers create millions of alternative designs so as to create 
highly optimized products which best satisfy the set parameters. Design flexibility, lightweightness, improved 
performance and energy efficiency are critical in today’s designs. Thus, putting cars on weight loss brings a wide 
range of benefits, chiefly among them reduction of fuel consumption, emissions and raw material usage. One of the 
technologies that cannot be left out is topology optimization. When it comes to product design, topology optimization 
reduces weight and material input (Berrocal et al., 2019). It uses mathematical algorithms to create components which 
have optimum weight distribution within a given domain (Vatanabe et al., 2016). The engineer identifies where 
material is to be placed in that domain under the given constraints (Sigmund and Maute, 2013). It is different from 
another vastly used weight reduction technology, material substitution in that material substitution replaces the part 
material without changing the part geometry, while topology optimization changes the part geometry without 
replacing its material (Chirinda and Matope, 2020). Topology optimization repeatedly analyzes and modifies the 
design, exploring the possible solutions in order to create an optimized geometry and improve performance (AMFG, 
2018). Combining topology optimization with monolithic (one piece) design blends the benefit of weight reduction

1320","3. Challenges and Potential Solutions 
3.1 Disparities between optimum design and cost-effective manufacture 
The major challenge is the disparities that rise between optimum design from the topology optimization and cost-
effective manufacture. The most efficient design which meets the design specifications at the minimum cost may not 
manufactured be cost effectively (AMFG, 2018). The difference between topology optimization and generative design 
is that the later considers manufacturability of the part (Vlah et al., 2020). Topology optimization often results in 
complex components (Christiansen et al., 2015). The solution would be optimal in the design process, but difficult to 
manufacture. As a result, cost effectiveness may be lost if the manufacturability of the part is not factored in from the 
beginning of the design process. This can be solved by incorporating the manufacturability of the part from the early 
stages of the design process. It is further explained in the Section 4.2.  
 
3.2 Complex designs are difficult to manufacture monolithically 
The manufacture of complex designs in a single shot is difficult when the conventional manufacturing methods are 
used (Olsson et al., 2017). These are the common manufacturing methods used by many companies. To manufacture 
the complex products, the casting and injection molding methods will require complex dies. As for the subtractive 
methods, they are not able to do internal channels like holes and pockets. The product will have to be broken down 
into many pieces, with the need for final assembly. As such, the higher the complexity, the higher the number of parts. 
This calls for a universal methodology which can be applied on both the monolithic design and each of subassembly 
in the case of a design which has more than one piece.  
 
4. Opportunities 
4.1 Topology Optimization of Monolithic Components for the Deep Drawing of Sheet Metal Parts 
Topology optimization has previously focused mainly on the automobile primary market industry components such 
as brackets, the suspension, the chassis, the engine cradle, the engine mount, the uprights and the brake pedals. Very 
little to no attention has been paid to the after-market industry components and sheet metal parts. This presents an 
opportunity for research. It is a well-known fact that topology optimization is usually associated with the additive 
manufacturing process (Brackett et al., 2011). This is due to the complexity of the resulting products, which makes it 
difficult to produce them using other conventional manufacturing methods such as casting, forging, extrusion and 
machining. The deep drawing process, unlike the majority of the conventional manufacturing methods, is well adapted 
for manufacturing geometrically complex sheet metal components and for improving the strength of that material 
through strain hardening (Groover, 2010). For the production of sheet metal parts, the deep drawing process can be 
used to produce a monolithic part in one shot. This has the following benefits: reduced part number, lightweightness, 
high raw material utilization, and high mechanical strength through strain hardening.  
 
4.2 Methodology that Combines Topology Optimization with Manufacturability  
Many times, topology optimization focuses on the design aspect only, neglecting the manufacturability of the resulting 
design. At times this renders the design optimum but non-manufacturable (Liu and Ma, 2016). Manufacturability is 
an important aspect of the design. 80% of the product cost can be calculated once the design process is finished 
(Anderson, 2020). The design process will determine the manufacturing method for the component. Hence, it is of 
paramount importance that manufacturability is factored in at the early stages of the design, via the methodologies 
that combine topology optimization with the final manufacturing process. There is also room for the methodology to 
combine topology optimization with hybrid manufacturing. This takes advantages of the capabilities of both the 
subtractive and additive manufacturing methods.  
 
5. Conclusion  
Topology optimization is very important in enabling the production of strong, lightweight functional parts. It uses 
algorithms to reduce component weight and material input. The purpose of the research was to present the emerging 
trends, challenges and opportunities in the development of methodologies for topology optimization of monolithic 
components. Having methodology as part of the design process helps to eliminate the long iterations that are done in 
topology optimization. It also eliminates human input and accelerates the product design process. The majority of the 
methodologies do not factor in manufacturability and as such some optimum designs are not economic to manufacture. 
These disparities between optimum design and cost-effective manufacture call for the incorporation of the 
manufacturability of the part from the early stages of the design process. Topology optimization usually results in 
complex designs and these are usually difficult to manufacture monolithically when the conventional manufacturing 
processes are involved. As such, a universal methodology which can be applied on both the monolithic design and

not yet been fully explored is the area of topology optimization of monolithic components for the deep drawing process 
for sheet metal parts. Combining topology optimization with monolithic design for the deep drawing process blends 
the benefit of weight reduction with the simplification of the assembly process. Other benefits include reduced part 
number, lightweightness, high raw material utilization, and high mechanical strength through strain hardening. The 
topology optimization technology is usually used for the vehicle primary market products such as brackets, and this 
is combined with additive manufacturing. It is important to note that the deep drawing process can manufacture sheet 
metal parts in one shot. This can be utilized for the after-market industry production of products such as the roof tents 
and canopies.

Abstract 
Locating warehouses and plants so that one is able to consider the forward and reverse flow as well is an important 
problem. In this paper we consider locating plants that directly supply to markets and are located so that forward and 
reverse flows are considered. We seek to min cost of location and distribution (forward and reverse). We give novel 
strong linking constraints that are extensions of traditional SPLP & CPLP (simple plant and capacitated plant location 
problems). This is expected to provide better performance of the branch and bound algorithms.

Abstract  
 
This study investigates the interwoven relationships of social capital dimensions and social capital's role on 
Industry 4.0 readiness in developing economies. We explore the mediating role of knowledge-based 
dynamic capabilities in the relationship of social capital and Industry 4.0 readiness. Furthermore, 
moderating role of potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity is also examined. 
Structural equation modelling is employed on data collected from 320 managers in 81 export manufacturing 
firms in Pakistan. Results reveal that structural social capital is positively related to relational social capital, 
and relational capital is positively associated to cognitive social capital. Moreover, there is a positive 
relationship between social capital and Industry 4.0 readiness, and knowledge-based dynamic capability 
mediates this relationship. Results support that realized absorptive capacity moderates the relationship 
between knowledge-based dynamic capability and Industry 4.0 readiness. We contribute by directing 
developing economies to implement Industry 4.0 technology and strive in this digital transition epoch.

Abstract 
 
COVID-19 pandemic was declared a global emergency as it changed people’s lifestyle socially and economically. 
Thus COVID-19 does not only have health impact, but impact global economies, energy demand or energy poverty 
and carbon emissions, and many more. Energy demand and consumption  are foremost among global challenges. 
Specifically, COVID-19 has changed the energy consumption pattern of most homes, organizations, industries, and 
nations as the energy sector provides fuel for most of the activities in every walk of life. This has brought everyone 
faced-to-face with the three-sided challenge: COVID-19 health issues, economic issues and climate change.  It is 
projected that countries that were in full lockdown would have 25% decline in energy demand per week and an average 
of 18% reduction for countries in partial lockdown. It was also assessed that the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on 
global energy demand is seven times less when compared with the impact of 2020 COVID-19 on global energy 
demand.  Another projection was that demands for oil, coal, gas, nuclear as sources of energy – will drop while that 
for renewables will increase. Precisely, oil, coal and CO2 emission are expected to drop by 9%, 8% and 8% 
respectively. CO2 emission will be six times larger compared to CO2 reduction caused by global financial crises in 
2009 and two times of all reductions since end of World War II. It is however feared that the rebound effect of emission 
might be higher than the fall if concerted effort is not made to promote clean and efficient energy technology.  
 
In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated 6% reduction in global gross domestic product (GDP) 
as a result of COVID-19 in 2020 and a 7% rebound effect in 2021. It was projected that in 2025%, global GDP will 
drop by 9% due to COVID-19. Aviation, commuting and office-space are respectively projected to drop by 5%, 2% 
& 1% by 2025. The IMF further affirmed that global energy demand fell by 8% in 2020, and that it will fluctuate 
below pre-COVID-19 prediction by about (6-8)% till 2050. Also, assessed was that transport energy used will never 
again attain it 2019 figures; the consumption of steel and construction materials for office building will tremendously 
reduce. 
 
In the face of this once-in-a-century crisis, there are many possible outcomes for energy use and emission as well as 
contributing factors. This intriguing interplay of estimates of certain indicators and determinants is very captivating 
and has sparked-off discussions and surveys at various levels and quarters like similar, previous crises.    There is need 
for a systematic review, visualization, and mapping of existing literature on this subject. This study will review and

Abstract 
 
College students have been exposed to online classes ever since the COVID-19 pandemic situation arose. Exposure 
to the discomfort of utilizing gadgets while attending online classes or performing tasks on work desks has been 
rapidly emerging and increasing. This becomes a widely known issue for most college students and must be given 
early treatment to decrease such musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and risks. Causes of these MSDs are awkward 
posture, repetitive tasks, and maintaining a posture for long periods. This study aims to identify a significant difference 
in the musculoskeletal discomfort level of respondents on several factors such as gender, age, type of gadget used, 
hand control, type of keyboard, screen time, and workstation setup. The musculoskeletal discomfort of users 
experienced on body and hand were separately analyzed using Cornell Musculoskeletal Disorder Questionnaire 
(CMDQ). The results of the study revealed that college students who often use computer-based work in online classes 
experience discomfort on the lower back, neck, upper back, and right wrist while specific hand parts that have a high 
prevalence of discomfort are the wrist, ring, middle, index fingers, and thenar region. The result of ANOVA also 
revealed that students who used laptops (x=709.8) have higher body discomfort compared to users of desktops 
(x=199.7). It was also proved that students who use computers for more than 7 hours have higher body discomfort 
(x=285.2) than students who use computers for 3-6 hrs a day (x=172). Similarly, for hand discomfort, it was identified 
that laptop keyboard users (x=166.2) have higher discomfort than mechanical keyboard users (x=86.6), the same goes 
with screen time. Students who use computers for more than 7 hours per day (x=153.7) have significantly higher hand 
discomfort than those who use them for 3-6 hrs (x=59). Given this condition, we have proposed recommendations and 
prevention attributes to minimize the risk of MSD of students.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Study 
Online classes started ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Students around the world, such as the Philippines, 
are being forced to stay at home and enroll in their respective universities or schools to conduct online classes with 
classroom settings where professors and teachers are involved. A little background of this is that there are children 
ages 9-11 located in 186 countries experiencing school lockdowns because of the current situation. With the abrupt 
turn away from the classroom in many parts of the world, some individuals are curious whether online learning 
adoption would continue post-pandemic, and how such a shift will affect the global education industry. (Li, 2020). 
Classes are specifically being done with the use of the Zoom application, Blackboard, CANVAS, and the like. Since 
students are imposed to set up their cameras and laptops in a manner where professors and teachers should be able to 
witness, many students could not afford this which adds up stress to their mental health and the loss of interest in 
learning. Not only that, with the minimum amount of students who can financially manage to supply their work set 
up. It is not unusual for students to struggle with their work environment, which causes pain to different body parts 
due to hours of sitting on their monobloc chairs, on the floor, or a shortage of ergonomic facilities to maintain their 
productivity at its peak.

1332","One-way ANOVA was also performed to distinguish the significance of hand discomforts between the computer-
based factors identified. For hand control, having the p-value of 0.77, it signifies that for the hand discomfort, there's 
no significant difference among the respondents that use a mouse, to those that use the touchpad of their respective 
laptops. Next, for the type of keyboard use, it has been identified that there's a significance to the hand discomfort 
among laptop keyboard users to mechanical keyboard users. Through further investigation, the angle of the keyboard 
is a factor to this—some brands of the mechanical keyboard allow their consumers to adjust the angle of their 
keyboards that best fit their comfortability, while most laptop users' keyboard-only lay flat, 90°—which tends to tire 
the hands when typing for hours or so. Following, for the type of gadget used, the calculated p-value of 0.156 indicated 
that the hand discomfort of the desktop users is not significant to the hand discomfort of the laptop users. Lastly, 
there's a significant difference in the hand discomfort score based on their screen time, since the screen time of 
respondents indicates that they're also using their hands from time to time, thus the overuse of the body part. In general, 
the factors type of keyboard and screen time of respondents significantly affect the hand discomfort of the respondents. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the study proved that there are significant differences among the different factors shown above versus 
the discomfort of students when having their online classes in a computer-based work setting. This means that the 
researchers have inspected whether these different factors are attributed to the discomfort of college students.  
However, there were only some factors that were significantly different from the discomfort feeling of students. From 
that speculation, it suggests that not at all factors are linked to the discomfort and MSD risks of the samples. This was 
thoroughly investigated by the researchers which among these factors has the highest CMDQ score rating. Then, it 
was rated based on the risk rating of the CMDQ which among these factors highly contributes to the discomfort of 
college students when in a computer-based work set up. The researchers considered the gender difference of each 
college student since they have unequal height differences. Not all work set-ups are originally made for a particular 
student considering its height and the length of each body part. But with the help of ANOVA, this doesn't affect the 
discomfort of students. Therefore, it is considered not significant. As expected, its average screen time and hand 
control play a big role in the discomfort of particularly the hands. As per the body parts, the only factors that are 
greatly affected by the discomfort of students are their age, type of gadget used, and average screen time. Both 
categories (body and hand) have significant remarks on the average screen time. This is practically rational because 
students utilize their gadgets for a long period where the eyes are for visibility, hands for typing, and body to support 
such agendas and tasks. This works altogether and creates a connection between factor to factor. College students 
have a broader field compared to high-school students. As a result, they are prone to having an extended time when it 
comes to computer usage. This is the reason for workloads in college.  
 
The most common areas that are affected by very severe cases of MSD are the lower back, neck, and upper back of 
the body. For the CMDQ hand, the most common area that's affected with MSD risks is the right wrist. There are 
some conditions in this research study; most of the respondents are right-handed which did not give much attention to 
the left wrists. But overall, the wrists, neck, lower and upper body are prone to having MSD risks and discomfort. 
Respondents that are identified with a very severe and severe case for the body and hand should make changes and 
revision of their work set-ups to avoid MSD risks. The main behaviors that cause MSDs are maintaining a posture for 
an extended period, repetitive tasks, and as well as awkward postures. 
 
Work-related musculoskeletal discomforts (WMSD) and symptoms are primarily caused by psychological (stress, 
cognitive load, etc.) and organizational (inappropriate working-rest time, lack of work-enrichment, etc.) factors in the 
workplace (static and poor postures, repetition of gestures, non-ergonomic workstation arrangement, etc.). It is critical 
to improving working conditions, organizational design and layout, and effective ergonomic interventions in the 
workplace. Preventing and eliminating WMSDs requires an evaluation of the workplace, monitoring of the related 
risk factors, medical management, and education. (Erman, 2019). 
 
This study spreads awareness that symptoms must be treated as early as possible. Recommendations and prevention 
actions are already given in this research study that can act as a starting point in attracting students, engineers, and 
ergonomists to take into action. According to Gautam (2017), if the discomforts and pain continue, it will become a 
chronic condition that will result in musculoskeletal distress and disorders. To enhance the current practice of laptop 
use and to reduce health issues among students, there is a need to raise ergonomics awareness. It's critical to monitor 
students' laptop use and postures so that musculoskeletal disorders and their effects can be managed before they 
become an obsession. Having a better understanding and being able to come up with strategies on how to deal with 
one's posture can eliminate and prevent musculoskeletal risk. Moreover, this study recommends its readers to be

school papers so that everyone can be aware of the health risks caused by prolonged usage of computers. Furthermore, 
it is recommended to seek professional help when experiencing discomfort aligned with the musculoskeletal system. 
Attending intervention, seminars, and workshops that tackle ergonomic approaches is advisable.

Abstract  
 
As the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) took away the accustomed routines of the people, the prevalence of online 
platforms in present times became more evident as every field or industry opt to adapt to the new normal. With that, 
education was never excluded from the said adaptation. As schooling cannot be hindered, the educational system 
transitioned from having a face-to-face method to conducting online classes for a safer and more convenient learning 
experience. However, this adaptation did not solely bring convenience as numerous students and teachers encounter 
different challenges, and one of these is the condition of the available workplace. Several studies have proven that the 
environment of the area of work must always assure comfortability as this can impact an individual's mental fatigue 
and cognitive performance. As the temperature is among the said factors, the researchers aimed to determine the 
perceived effect of the thermal comfort and measured temperature level on the students' mental fatigue. Upon the 
evaluation of gathered data and application of statistical tools using ANOVA and correlation analysis, it proved that 
thermal comfort experienced by students during online class varies based on the time of the study (morning, afternoon, 
and evening) and based on the source of ventilation (fan, A/C units and multiple sources of ventilation). Results also 
showed that thermal comfort indeed plays a pivotal role in the mental fatigue of students. it depicted that measured 
temperature level of students during online class has a direct relationship to the mental fatigue of students specifically 
on dimensions such as Concentration Difficulty (r=0.482, p<0.001) Irritability (r=0.813, p<0.001), Unproductivity 
(r=0.402, p<0.001), and Mental Recovery from high temperature (r=0.661, p<0.001).

1. Introduction 
1.1. Background of the Study 
Over the past decades, the continuous advancement of technology brought an overwhelming response from people 
globally. The unceasing progression of technology has built bridges towards efficiency and convenience, may it be 
for communication, education, business, and others. This concept has cultivated several disputes and perceptions. 
However, despite the disadvantages it bears, it could not outweigh the dominance of its benefits. As every individual 
act as the prime beneficiary of the said development, the undeniable reliance on technology and the internet is very 
evident. With that, the world tends to face every challenge having technology as both their main weapon and shield. 
In the year 2020, a virus deprived the world of its freedom and safety. Coronavirus disease is a new infectious disease 
that has been taking over globally. The said phenomenon has shocked and stunned people as it took away their normal 
routines. This pandemic paved the way to the maximization of the use of online platforms as it is the safest way to 
continue what has been started before encountering this pandemic. These online platforms helped in reducing the 
hindrance for different industries, as well as education.  
 
Even so, there are still challenges that are yet to be addressed in coping with the new normal. As the pandemic forced 
the transitioning of education to online learning, a lot of people encounter difficulties with the new education system. 
Availability of technology and lack of access to resources is the most common hindrances. However, it is often 
forgotten that another challenge that needs to be heeded is the unpreparedness of the workplace. Despite the

evening since they are more thermally comfortable during this time of the day. The ANOVA test and Tukey's Test 
also supported that the respondents' thermal comfort is significantly higher during the evening than the other choices. 
For the sources of ventilation, it was also proven that the thermal comfort of the respondents is significantly different 
when they own a fan. In comparison, it is evident that there is no significant difference in the thermal comfort of the 
respondents based on the area of study. In addition, one of the objectives of the study is to understand the relationship 
of temperature to Mental Fatigue. Through the Correlation Test, the researchers were able to determine which among 
the dimensions can have an impact on the temperature. The researchers specifically determined that only the 
dimensions Concentration Difficulty, Irritability, Unproductivity, and Mental Recovery from a high temperature 
correlate with temperature. 
 
4. Conclusion               
The ongoing pandemic brought numerous challenges to everyone. These include the sudden transition of traditional 
learning to online education. Even though people continuously find ways to adapt to current conditions, there are 
essential elements that should be acknowledged as they try to perceive and survive this pandemic. One of the most 
significant occurring changes is the adjustment in the working environment. As mentioned earlier, it is very important 
to heed the state of the working area as it has a significant effect on productivity and motivation (Ernst, 2020). Through 
further exploration, the researchers found out that temperature influences productivity and the cognitive performance 
of a person (Fisk, Lei, & Seppanen, 2006). Despite the existing studies, there is a lack of understanding regarding the 
relationship between temperature and Mental Fatigue. The researchers believed that it is essential to establish this 
relationship for it can help determine the factors that can lead to mental fatigue.  
 
With that being said, the study focused on understanding the relationship between temperature and Mental Fatigue 
through evaluating the Mental Fatigue Score of the respondents. As the researchers analyzed the gathered data, they 
found out that most participants believed that the sources of ventilation found in the area of study are sufficient enough 
to adjust to their thermal comfort. Despite that, the researchers identified their Heat Stress Category to assess whether 
the respondents are in good condition depending on the room temperature. The researchers found out that the average 
room temperature equivalent to 28.15 degrees Celsius is under the Yellow category. It was stated that the workers 
should be only exposed to this temperature for 40 minutes and should have a rest of 20 minutes. Even if the conditions 
are met, it is still advisable to reduce the temperature for the well-being of the workers. Moreover, the researchers also 
found out that 63% of the respondents prefer to study in the bedroom and chose to study during the evening. 
Furthermore, the study used statistical treatments specifically ANOVA Test and Tukey's Post Hoc Test to determine 
whether factors such as the source of ventilation, time, and area of study have an impact on thermal comfort. The 
results showed that 2 out of 3 factors have a significant difference in thermal comfort. The researchers found out that 
students who study in the evening have a higher thermal comfort compared to those who prefer during the morning 
or afternoon. Results also showed that there is a difference in thermal comfort based on the source of ventilation. On 
the contrary, the researchers also found out that there is no significant difference between the thermal comfort of the 
respondents based on the area of study. 
 
As the researchers gathered the Mental Fatigue Scores of respondents, they were able to determine which among the 
dimensions have correlations with temperature using a Correlation Test. The researchers were able to specify that the 
dimensions Concentration Difficulty, Irritability, Unproductivity, and Mental Recovery from high temperature can be 
associated with temperature. Overall, the study was able to establish that there is a relationship between temperature 
and Mental Fatigue, thus means that it is important to ensure that the room temperature of the workplace is appropriate 
and comfortable, for better productivity and cognitive performance during online classes.  
 
The researchers recommend that future studies fill the gaps of the existing researches. For better and more accurate 
results, the temperature of the respondents should be measured using an appropriate temperature device, as the 
researchers of this paper had limited equipment. This can help the researchers to formulate more precise conclusions 
and bases. Other factors that can affect the temperature (i.e. size of the room, number of people staying in the same 
room, etc.) must also be considered in determining the effects of temperature level on the mental fatigue of the 
students. Other educational levels should also be considered for their respondents for a more extensive scope.

Abstract 
 
This study investigates empirically the effects of online classes on the perceived mental fatigue of undergraduate 
college students from Mapúa University in the Philippines. The current global pandemic and the abrupt shift from 
face-to-face classes to remote learning affected the mental health of the students. The researchers used data from a 
sample of 100 respondents obtained from a digital survey containing the Mental Fatigue Scale, which was then 
analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results presented a strong relationship between the academic 
workload factors during online classes and the overall mental fatigue level of students. Thus, results show that these 
factors significantly contribute to the level of intensity of the mental fatigue of college students. It was concluded that 
the demographics did not contribute to the level of mental fatigue of the students. Although the majority of the 
respondents sleep less than 8 hours, it presented no significant effect on the level of mental fatigue. This means that 
the academic workload of the respondents contributes to an elevated mental fatigue level. It is recommended that a 
change in the distribution of major/minor courses and proper time management will help decrease the level of mental 
fatigue of the students.

1. Introduction  
Mental fatigue is identified as the psychological state as a result of long exposure to cognitive stress and activity 
(Maarten A.S. Boksem & Tops, 2008). This sensation is projected similar to tiredness or lack of energy, which is why 
it is not talked about often and in turn may cause negative implications that affect day-to-day human functions. This 
type of fatigue significantly differs from physical fatigue although mental fatigue has similar signs and symptoms to 
physical fatigue, they are separate biological functions, yet may co-exist (Fatigue Science, 2019). While physical 
fatigue exists due to exertion of excessive physical force, the mental state of an individual is unharmed and 
recuperation is only needed to resolve it, but it poses different implications to an individual who experiences mental 
fatigue. This type of fatigue is a result of an accumulated amount of mental strain which impairs an individual’s 
capacity to handle stress (Mohan Garikiparithi, 2017). 
 
Marcora et al. (2009) stated that mental fatigue has a direct effect when it comes to the physical performance of the 
person and further reiterated that the brain has a vital role when it comes to the regulation of endurance performance. 
In addition, Smith et al. (2019) justified that mental fatigue is a product of demanding cognitive activity, and as a 
result, mental fatigue could take in many forms behaviorally and physiologically. Aside from this, the researchers also 
stated that those types of mental fatigue are more distinguishable than the other chronic forms of fatigue such as the 
cognitive impairments that come with aging or diseases.

1354",,"For the number of units enrolled for the term, it was concluded that respondents with enrolled units less than 9 differ 
significantly from those with 9-12 and greater than 15 units enrolled for the current term. For the number of major 
subjects enrolled for the term, it was shown that respondents with more than 8 major subjects have significantly higher 
differences as compared to those with only less than 4 and 5-8 major subjects. For the average number of sleep per 
day in hours, it was concluded that students who study for more than 8 hours a day, including online classes, differ 
significantly as compared to those with only less than 4 and 4-6 hours of study per day.   
 
Given that, it was seen and computed that the independent variables, specifically the number of units enrolled for the 
term, number of major courses, and the average number of sleep per day in hours, highly affect the dependent variable. 
This means that there is a strong positive relationship when compared individually with the overall MFS score and 
results show that as the number of units enrolled for the term, number of major subjects taken, and the average duration 
of study of the students per hour increases, the overall mental fatigue score also increases which means that the 
academic workload causes the rise of mental fatigue levels of students that affects their overall mental well-being. 
 
5. Recommendation 
Based on the results of the statistical analysis conducted, the researchers recommend the following; 
For the institution, it is recommended to change the distribution of major and minor courses loaded on the student per 
term. Based on the results, a student’s mental fatigue level increases because of the number of major/minor courses 
loaded in their curriculum. This means that the finalized workload of a student is statistically overwhelming. In 
addition to that, the results also showed that the average study hours of a student significantly affect the level of mental 
fatigue of the student. In theory, the average study hours of a student are correlated to the units loaded in their 
curriculum. Therefore, a change in the distribution of the student’s workload will also change the study hours.  
 
For the students, the amount of sleep shows no significant effect on the level of mental fatigue. However, the average 
study hours used do. It is recommended to properly manage the time used for leisure and other activities and academic 
responsibilities. Using an application or software that shows the timeline and due date could help with the ease and 
prioritization of workload. In addition to that, scheduling subjects/courses to take in advance could help with the 
preparation of one’s mental state., If the workload is properly managed, it will provide the student ample amount of 
time to prepare and adjust based on the target workload.  
 
For future researchers, since the study conducted is only limited to undergraduate college students of Mapúa 
University, it is recommended to widen the scope to high-school and grade-school students. Both departments offer 
different amounts of workload per student, therefore students from both departments may experience different levels 
of mental fatigue. Another, it is recommended to include the area of study on the factors that affect the intensity of 
mental fatigue of the students. Because of COVID-19, all classes are now delivered online. Therefore, change in the 
environment may have had an impact on the mental state of the student.

Abstract 
 
The introduction of the COVID-19 had a huge impact on the delivery of education. To make the most out of the time 
spent at home during quarantine, students are now taking up online classes implemented to them by their respective 
schools. This means prolonged sitting behind their computers while learning. The objective of this study is to find 
various relationships between the postures of students and their corresponding discomforts experienced during online 
classes. The ROSA method together with the application of the Corlett and Bishop's discomfort scale are used. The 
researchers found out that long durations of sitting while having online classes does lead to students experiencing 
more painful discomforts thus affecting the efficiency of how they study. It can also be concluded that the majority of 
the dimensions based on the ROSA method have the most effect on the lower back of the respondents, were more 
particularly the dimensions of the Monitor and Headset are the only dimensions that do not play a role in affecting 
any body parts.

1. Introduction 
As COVID -19 pandemic spread in early 2020, the world has drastically changed into a new era where the lifestyle of 
every person shifted into a new form. Every country was sent to different isolation/quarantine to mitigate the spread 
of the virus. As a result, offices and schools were closed indefinitely and continued into a new platform, in an 
online/virtual world.  
 
The business casual wear and school uniform have evolved into home casual wear, in-person meetings have evolved 
into web conferences, and in-person school rooms have evolved into online assignments and virtual lessons, because 
of the modern standard or New Normal (Gruman, 2020). In this current time, people specifically students spend more 
time in front of screens and monitors than ever before, where they spend a lengthy period in one sitting area having 
only a work posture in a work from home (WFH) set up as the new form of study condition. 
 
As WFH setup is being promoted and strengthens over time, it becomes one of the ideal alternatives to continue the 
phase of life. Thus, the home environment cannot be compared to the workplace/classrooms. In particular, the absence 
of ergonomic office/school furniture at home may hinder a healthy posture and may promote the onset of (MSD) 
Musculoskeletal Disorders (CCOHS, n.d.). According to Bernard & Putz-Anderson (1997) Musculoskeletal disorders 
(MSDs) are defined as a group of inflammatory and degenerative conditions that affect muscles, tendons, joints, 
ligaments, peripheral nerves, and the supporting blood vessels. So for students studying in a sedentary position with 
no other alternative for prolonged periods increases the risk of neck and back pains. 
 
In other alternatives, some homes have a complete set of desks and chairs but may not have the adjustability needed 
to provide a suitable long-term work environment. When setting up the homework environment, remember to 
implement ergonomics basics to ensure the safety and health of the people (Fernandez, Miller, & Subramanian, 2020). 
Having a WFH setup may help to redefine the new system of living as people have the chance to stay home and help 
to mitigate the spread of the virus, nevertheless, work from home didn't gain a strong impetus, as homes of every

1366","As shown above, of the obtained values, the dimension of chair height has a moderately significant relationship with 
the shoulder but has a strong significant relationship with the lower back and thigh. As a result, we can conclude that 
when a mismatch occurs for the chair height or whenever it is too low or too high, the body parts experiencing a strong 
relationship in discomfort are the lower back and thigh, as well as a moderate relationship in discomfort for the 
shoulder. 
 
As shown above, of the obtained values, the dimension of pan depth has a moderately significant relationship with the 
shoulder and has a strong significant relationship with the lower back and thigh. As a result, we can conclude that 
when a mismatch occurs for the pan depth or whenever it is too low or too high, the subjects experience discomfort 
on the lower back and thigh, as well as moderate discomfort on the shoulder. 
 
As shown above, of the obtained values, the dimension of the armrest has a strong significant relationship with the 
shoulder, arm, lower back, buttock. Thigh and knee. As a result, we can conclude that when a mismatch occurs for 
the armrest or whenever it is too low or too high, the subjects may experience discomfort on the shoulder and arms, 
as well as moderate discomfort on the lower back, buttock, thigh, and knee. 
 
As shown above, of the obtained values, the dimension of back support has a moderately significant relationship with 
the shoulder lower back and thigh. As a result, we can conclude that when a mismatch occurs for the back support or 
whenever it is too low or too high, the subjects may experience discomfort on the lower back and thigh, as well as 
moderate discomfort on the shoulder. 
 
The dimension of the monitor and headset in comparison to all the discomfort scores does not have a significant 
relationship since the p-values of all of them are above the p alpha value of 0.05. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
the monitor and headset do not affect the body discomfort scores. 
 
As shown above, of the obtained values, the dimension of the mouse has a strong significant relationship with the 
shoulder, arm, lower back, buttock, knee, foot, and leg. That’s because the value obtained for R is 0.876 indicating a 
strong strength as it is above 0.5. As a result, we can conclude that when a mismatch occurs for the mouse or whenever 
it is too low or too high, the subjects may experience discomfort on the shoulder, arm, and lower back as well as a 
moderate discomfort on the buttock, knee and the leg and foot. 
 
As shown above, of the obtained values, the dimension of the keyboard has a moderately significant relationship with 
the shoulder and lower back, leg and foot while the strong relationship with the arm and middle back. As a result, we 
can conclude that when a mismatch occurs for the keyboard or whenever it is too low or too high, the subjects may 
experience discomfort on the arm and the middle back, as well as a moderate discomfort on the shoulder, lower back, 
and the leg and foot. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The obtained results gave a proper indication that students with underweight/overweight BMI tend to experience 
higher discomfort levels compared to normal BMI. While longer periods of class hours do lead to students 
experiencing more painful discomforts thus affecting the efficiency of how they study. It can also be concluded that 
all the dimensions do not greatly affect the head and neck of the respondents. Where more particularly the dimensions 
of the Monitor and Headset are the only dimensions that do not play a role in affecting any body parts according to 
the calculations computed by the researchers based on the data given by the respondents. This study certainly does 
not entirely indicate or represent the many students out there around the world studying in online classes, which is 
why we should consider that not everyone has the necessities to achieve the best possible ergonomic setup that is 
suitable and convenient for their bodies. Therefore, conducting a similar study in the future that is more diverse in 
terms of the national origin of the respondents and where they live can provide a more realistic view when trying to 
acquire a comparison between the work posture and MSD of students at a projected view. Overall, the ROSA method 
together with the application of the Corlett and Bishop’s discomfort scale made the comparison of the relationship of 
this study more constructive and deliverable. 
 
The conducted study is done within a restricted duration, and it should also be considered that it was also under an 
abnormal situation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers used all the resources available given 
the limited period. It is recommended for future researchers interested in this field of the topic to consider gathering 
more respondents to collect data from. It is best to get respondents from each category indicated in your questionnaire

1375","to compare them easily and to have equal counts under each classification. The recommended number of respondents 
is 100 to have the required data and not experience data shortage, thus resulting in the most accurate data. It is 
recommended to replicate this study to have a more diverse representation of the students undergoing online classes 
because the result of the study only applies to the respondents of the study itself. If possible, it is best to take the 
pictures of the respondents for the ROSA by the researchers themselves to get the best photo possible. It is 
recommended to consider all possible factors contributing to the musculoskeletal discomfort and problems of future 
respondents because the study only focused on the BMI and the hours of study.

Abstract 
 
This research study tackles the relationship of the noise level to the mental fatigue of the student during online classes. 
The researchers used survey questionnaires to gather data from the respondents who are students having online classes 
at home. The objective of the study is to determine if the perceived noise level of students significantly differs in terms 
of gender, area of study, and duration of the study. This study also intends to determine if noise exposure during online 
classes has a significant contribution to the mental fatigue of students. The statistical treatments used were descriptive 
statistics, ANOVA, and correlation. The results of the study revealed that perceived noise level does not significantly 
differ in terms of gender (p-value=0.804) while the area of study (p-value=0.017) and duration of the study (p-
value<0.0001) have significant differences in the perceived noise level of respondents. The result of correlation 
analysis also revealed that noise exposure during online class has a strong contribution to the mental fatigue of students 
specifically on dimensions such as sensitivity to noise, fatigue, and concentration having the p-value of 0.000, 0.021, 
and 0.000 respectively.

1. Introduction 
Due to the pandemic, most of the community was forced to conduct their work activities online throughout their own 
homes, which created lots of challenges for everyone. One of these challenges is the execution of their work-related 
activities in a home setting which generates a lot of distraction that leads to the unproductiveness of workers. Office 
settings are built to enhance productivity by minimizing the number of distractions in the area, compare with the home 
setting that is unsuitable to be a place for everyone to work. Due to this circumstance, everyone was affected by this 
shift, especially the students that require a lot of focus. Since education occurs in a school and face-to-face set-up, the 
current set-up is somewhat challenging because it is hard to find a perfect place in our own homes that felt the same 
comfort as we are in school.  
 
Noise has a massive impact on our daily living because it exists in all human activity. It is an unwanted sound that 
could affect our physical and mental health. Noise is the most common occupational health hazard in the 
manufacturing and industrial environment. As well as other environments such as schools, malls, highways, and 
houses. People who are being exposed to different noises may experience fatigue, tiredness, and hearing loss. The 
major health concerns of many people nowadays especially in the manufacturing and industrial environment. To 
prevent the following effects and outcomes of noise level exposure the noise level of the area must be minimized and 
reduced to the right noise levels (Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, 2019) 
 
According to studies (Khajenasiri, F., et al. 2016), almost 30 million individuals employed in the United States are 
continuously exposed to high noise levels. Having exposure to this different noise can have various effects depending 
on the type of occupation and work environment. In daylight, many people are busy doing their different tasks with 
the noise that surrounds them. A study again shows that noise influences the auditory system, and the reduction of 
hearing ability and noise affects our cardiovascular system and leads to anger, fatigue, headache, hypertension, and

night, having p-value less than 0.05. Shown also is the Pearson correlation (r) value which measures the strength of 
the relationship between the dimensions of mental fatigue score to the exposure to the noise level. Based on the result, 
irritability, sensitivity to noise, and concentration difficulties have a strong correlation to noise level (p-value<0.001). 
This means that as the exposure to a noise level of students increases, irritability, sensitivity to noise, and concentration 
difficulties of students also increases. However, the fatigue level, slowness of thinking, sensitivity to stress, increase 
tendency to become emotional, and decreased sleep at night have only a moderate correlation to exposure of noise 
level (p-value<0.05).  
 
6. Conclusion 
Due to the pandemic, most of the community was forced to conduct their work activities online throughout their own 
homes, which created lots of challenges for everyone. One of these challenges is the execution of their work-related 
activities in a home setting which generates a lot of distraction that leads to mental fatigue and stress. One of the 
causes of distraction is exposure to the noise level. Noise during online class can be caused by a dog barking, car horn, 
TV playing in the room, people chatting nearby, and other sources. Thus, this study was done to determine the effect 
of noise level on the mental fatigue of students during an online class. 
 
The results of the study have revealed that the perceived noise level of students significantly differs in terms of area 
of study and duration of the study. It was found that students who conduct online classes in the bedroom have perceived 
to have lower noise levels compared to students who are studying in the living room. It was also proved that students 
who study for more than 7 hours a day have perceived to have higher noise levels compared to students who study for 
6 hours and below. In this study, we were able to measure the mental fatigue of students concerning exposure to noise 
during online classes. We were able to correlate the effects of noise exposure to the specific dimension of the mental 
fatigue level of students. We have found that exposure to noise level could result in an increase in irritability, 
sensitivity to noise, and concentration difficulties of students.   
 
With these findings, it is recommended that students who are studying online at home should use noise-canceling 
headphones to minimize noise exposure from the background. It is also advised for students to have a few minutes 
break time in the middle of the class for them to take a rest for a couple of minutes and decrease their fatigue and 
exhaustion. And lastly, students should have a conducive space for learning such as the specific area in the house 
dedicated for an online class that is away from the noise and has an ambient atmosphere.

Abstract 
 
The research studied the mismatch between anthropometric measurements of senior high school and college students 
of Mapúa University to the current classroom chair design being used. Each of the two levels was split into two based 
on sex. In total there were 4 groups compared; the data comprised of SHS male, SHS female, college male, and college 
female. After performing the Anderson-Darling normality test and one-way ANOVA, the researchers determined that 
the anthropometric measurements of SHS and college students significantly differ, therefore, two ergonomic 
classroom chairs were needed separately for the two groups. In performing the mismatch analysis, it was found that 
the majority of the SHS students and college students have a high mismatch in terms of seat height. The existing seat 
height of the classroom chair is too high for the students.  a proposed design of the chair was then made. In comparing 
the mismatch of the existing dimensions to the proposed classroom chair, it was found out that the recommended seat 
height, seat depth, seat width, backrest height, and armrest height improved the overall design of the chair fitted for 
the majority of the users. The same goes with the backrest height, it was found that the existing chair design is too 
high for the users. Given this condition, the researchers were able to propose a new dimension for classroom chairs 
using the anthropometric measurements gathered from the SHS and college students of Mapua University. The 
mismatch analysis of the proposed chair proved that the recommended seat height, seat depth, seat width, backrest 
height, and armrest height improved the overall design of the chair fitted for the majority of the users.

1. Introduction 
According to Sarmiento and Orale, the Philippines' current curriculum called the enhanced basic education program 
much more known as the K-12 program under the RA 10533 comprises a year in kindergarten, 6 years in elementary, 
4 years in junior high school, and 2 years in senior high school (2016). This is a requirement for any student before 
they can enter college. Therefore, a minimum of 13 years is spent by a majority of Filipino students before they take 
up a program in college which ranges from a duration of 6 months to 10 years for doctoral degrees. Filipino degree 
holders spent a great amount of time in classrooms where the learning happens. A basic component of any classroom 
for that matter is a chair where students will sit down while listening to the lecture. Therefore, classroom chairs are 
crucial in education and they must be ergonomically designed (Al-Hinai1, Mahmood & Shamsuzzoha, 2018) 
 
According to Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, serious occupational health and safety risks are 
possible consequences of sitting for a long period. Even though sitting is less strenuous, such an activity does not 
except people from developing injuries. That is why providing an ergonomic chair to students is vital. Also, an 
ergonomically designed classroom chair is not just important to the student's health but also their overall performance 
in school. Isedowo stated that a properly designed chair lessens the need of the learner to adjust during lecture, 
therefore, lessening the diversion of their attention away from their instructor (2012).

Table 16 represents a summary of the gathered data from the mismatch analyses of the existing versus the proposed 
measurements. The improvement percentages show how much improvement will happen when the proposed 
measurement is followed instead of the actual or existing measurements. With reference to the results, it can be seen 
that the proposed armchair provides improvements for the seat height, seat depth, backrest height, and armrest height. 
wherein the greatest improvement would be the seat height (88.15%) for the SHS students and the backrest height for 
college students (171%). With regards to the seat width, both the existing and proposed armchair fit all students. 
Overall, the proposed classroom ergonomic chair is perceived to be more ideal for the students.  
 
4. Conclusion 
The researchers were able to identify that there is a significant difference in measurements between male and female 
senior high school students as well as male and female college students. Furthermore, measurements of both female 
populations of senior high and college, and both male populations of senior high school and college students showed 
significant differences as well. Hence, there is a need to produce chairs with different armchair measurements for the 
two distinct levels. The researchers were also able to suggest standard measurements for the five vital chair dimensions 
identified for the research. It was later found out that the recommended seat height, seat depth, seat width, backrest 
height, and armrest height improved the overall design of the chair fitted for the majority of the users.  
 
With this, the researchers suggest future investigators have more sample sizes for better accuracy since the more 
people assessed, the more accurate the suggested standard measurements for the chairs will be. Also, it is 
recommended to eliminate outliers more precisely and accurately. Hence, in the Anderson-Darling test, future studies 
must not only dwell on the AD score but rather focus on the p-value of the normality test. Lastly, future studies could 
explore the possibility of considering the average anthropometric measurements from the participants instead of 
having the minimum and maximum percentiles as the basis for designing and proposing chair dimensions. In this way, 
the said dimensions could match more students.

Abstract 
 
One of the most important standard operating procedures for any organization is running the business in a cost-
effective manner. Normally during that business, workforces, equipment, fleet, etc are considered to be replaced after 
particular period of time, which depends on the operational situation. In this paper, replacement of grass fleet is studied 
in one of the universities. Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost (EAUC) method is used for that purpose for three years 
period of time. The parameters considered for the said fleet are its operation cost, maintenance cost, procurement cost, 
interest rate, resale value at the end of each financial year, depreciation, interest on procurement cost, and the total 
marginal cost. EAUC has been calculated for each year and should attracting output for the operators about the time 
they can replace the fleet in discussion.

1. Introduction and Literature Review 
The principles of engineering economy are utilized to analyze alternative uses of financial resources. The 
evaluation should depend on applying cost data analysis concerning the most important economic factors. Such factors 
are related to equipment usage as operation and maintenance costs, salvage values, depreciation, work delivered (i.e. 
working hours or vehicle distance), the cost of capital, tax credits, if exists (Dekker, 1996). The most important 
decision is the choice between keeping and replacing the operational vehicle during the remaining anticipated life. 
The existing vehicle operating in service (under study) is called the defender while, the challenger is the perspective 
of a replacement vehicle proposed as an alternative of the existing one, considered as the representative of the Defender 
vehicle group class (Newnan et al, 2013). Factors other than economy often enter into vehicle replacement analysis. 
Availability is defined as the probability that the system (such as a vehicle) is operating at any random time (Ireson et 
al, 1996). This can be accomplished when management guarantees that the service of a certain vehicle can be provided 
and performed with less down-time and high dependability (White et al, 2013). 
In the transportation sector, the determination of the most rational time for bus replacement is related to the 
efficient use of the buses and the company’s global costs any company needs to know the most adequate time to 
renewal or replace a bus to optimize its total costs, simultaneously guaranteeing the availability and quality of service 
and the customer satisfaction (Aoudia and Belmokhtar, 2008). Replacing an asset is a common practice in business 
and is a strategic decision of the organization that considers the optimization of operating costs, maintenance, and 
better operational efficiency. With the equipment life progress, fleet can present excessive operational and 
maintenance costs, in addition to the new technological alternatives that make the fleet obsolete. In this way, the main 
difficulty in replacing assets is the definition of the optimal moment of substitution within their economic life (Carter, 
1986). Fleet renewal or replacement can be observed as a concerned managerial issue that poses a significant 
challenge to logistics service providers or general business organization. This research addressed the fleet replacement 
analysis using equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC). The concept of fleet is traditionally discussed in certain 
industries, such as military, marine, logistics, and aviation industries. In asset management context, the fleet can also 
consist of machineries or equipment (Kinnunen et al, 2020). It would be beneficial to exploit the learnings from the 
traditional fleet management fields in other environments, where fleets can be considered in an extended manner. For 
example, digitalization generates massive amounts of data which can be exploited more efficiently for fleet 
management purposes. Kauffmann et al. (2012) developed a model to identify the optimal asset life for six fleet (three 
on road and three off road). This model presented the opportunity to reduce overall cost, improve the age of the fleet

From table 4, the minimum EUAC is for year 2, and therefore, the fleet should be kept for two years before being 
replaced. 
 
4. Conclusion 
EUAC has given a valid managerial support for the concern department to have a glimpse on the expected 
operational status of the fleet in discussion. All related costs have been considered. It is planned to cover other assets 
like other vehicles, some electrical equipment, some mechanical equipment, etc at the same place using the same 
method by considering the associated costs. Also, other department and colleges have shown their interest in doing 
the same about their business duties. EUAC has given the most optimum clue about the time of fleet replacement, 
which led to have an operational plan in a cost-effective manner. Also, it can be done with other heavy-duty equipment 
like chillers or power transformers by considering more than 4 years period of time.

Abstract 
 
Because of the increasing concern on sustainability issues such as scarcity of natural resources, rapid environmental 
degradation, unequal balance of social equities and global competitions, sustainable manufacturing strategies have 
recently received significant attention among the industry practitioners. Further, the customers are expecting low cost 
and environmental friendly products without compromising on quality. Therefore, manufacturing industries are now 
facing the challenge of producing low cost products by utilizing the resources effectively and at the same time by 
considering the environmental aspects. The main aim of the manufacturing industry is to adopt the sustainable 
practices in their existing supply chain, which lead to the reduction of natural resources, energy, and material usage. 
Sustainable manufacturing is a part of sustainable development, a framework that attempts to maintain a dynamic 
balance between economic, social and environmental concerns. For increasing the implementation of sustainable 
practices in manufacturing industries, it is necessary to understand what motivates people and what discourages them. 
The main objective of this project is to identify the drivers or factors influencing the implementation of sustainable 
manufacturing through literature and expert opinion. It is proposed to apply Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) 
tool as a methodology for analyzing the interaction among the drivers. In addition, MICMAC analysis is carried out 
to categorize the drivers based on dependence and driving power. The results of the ISM model indicate that use of 
personnel protective equipment; and effective utilization of resources are the top-level drivers. The results also show 
that environmental certification; and government policy and environmental regulations play a very important role in 
the effective implementation of sustainable manufacturing practices in industry. Further, by implementing the best 
practices, the manufacturing industry can produce sustainable products.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays there is a trend of development of a number of FDM-sourced elements that have improved the ways for 
fast prototyping. CAE software technologies enabled sharing of knowledge across different sectors in the industry, 
there are important research findings in the medical area in which FDM implies an interesting and a rather efficient 
option for surgical procedure assessment; mainstream PLA has been a matter of various studies trying to understand 
its behavior to its limits, a heat treatment on PLA materials could allow to have different, and more diverse 
applications. HTPLA is another variation that deserves attention due to its prospective. This material has proven to 
expand the availability of PLA to different sectors because of its rather ease printability and higher heat-resistance. 
This study would assess the properties of neat PLA and HTPLA printed with optimized parameters, in addition of an 
annealing process that would modify its internal structure. Results suggest that HTPLA can resist higher temperatures 
and stress changes whilst scoring lower elongation and tensile response degrading.

1. Introduction 
Additive Manufacturing procedures have become mainstream in order to speed up processes and manufacturing times 
for rapid prototyping; this achievement could only be possible with the fast growing of the AM sector. Various types 
of plastic sources are the first choice nowadays for this procedure. Thermoplastics like PLA, ABS, Polycarbonates 
like PC are among the most popular choices. Research on PLA found that it has the advantages of non-irritative 
fuming, rarely edge warp, and good formability when is fused and laid out (Pan et al., 2016). PLA is polymer made 
renewable resources, which makes it biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic (Torres et al., 2015). Research found 
that PLA’s advantages have turned it in prominence. Previous studies on this material have concentrated on the 
parameters of process and surface quality not in its mechanical properties. Therefore, PLA’s choice of work is 
mandatory, by analyzing the adhesive theory of the fused filament, the effects of nozzle moving and filling rate, as 
well as slice thickness have been assessed (Pan et al., 2016). 
 
Analysis on controllable printer parameters on PLA and HTPLA could lead to optimized components from each of 
the source materials. Print orientation and infill density alone have been shown to alter compressive, tensile, flexural, 
and impact strengths even by an order of magnitude in some cases (Lee et al., 2007),(PANDA et al., 2009), (Zhang & 
Peng, 2012). An important growing demand for sustainable materials nowadays, have made many users to choose 
PLA in more challenging conditions. As a result, demand exists to develop solutions to its integral limitations. This 
methods could include block copolymerization, chemical modification, and the use of nucleating agents, plasticizers, 
blends, and chain extenders. (Simmons et al., 2019) 
 
State of the art on the matter emphasizes the influence of postprocess annealing on certain mechanical properties in 
tensile loading. In tests, tensile modulus and heat deflection temperature increase versus neat PLA are found after 
annealing at 100°C (Wootthikanokkhan et al., 2013). An increase in useful ductility range coupled with an increase in

Abstract 
 
The United Nations (UN) developed sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015 to end poverty as a 
global agenda for the future to protect the planet, create peace and prosperity for its population. The UN 
emphasises the development should be balancing environmental, economic, and social 
sustainability. Also, nowadays governments, customers, and stakeholders’ pressure to remark 
environmental and social footprints have been increased. Decarbonising and sustainability of the supply 
chain is one of such novel ideas involving all the business value-adding operations. This includes 
purchasing, upstream, and downstream supply chains, distribution and collaboration with suppliers and 
patrons in a way that has the least negative environmental and social effects. To minimise energy 
consumption and carbon emissions in the supply chain operations we need to integrate carbon efficiency in 
suppliers, transportation, plants, distribution centers/warehouses all the way to the market. The main 
objective of this study is to investigate measuring eco-efficiency of suppliers in the supply chain with data 
envelopment analysis (DEA). It has the potential to minimise carbon footprints in the supply chain and to 
address the UN sustainability goals relating to creating a sustainable supply chain in measuring technical 
(operational), environmental and eco-efficiency of suppliers. In this paper, we model the necessity of 
simultaneous application of worst and best practice DEA in measuring eco-efficiency of suppliers to 
minimise carbon footprint in the supply chain. This model would help organisations to balance 
environmental, economic, and social sustainability in the supply chain in response to the UN sustainable 
development goals. It is found that this proposed model can provide a more reliable evaluation and selection 
of right suppliers considering their environmental and other traditional criteria. We also develop an 
integrated approach through DEA models for measuring technical (operational), environmental and eco-
efficiency of suppliers. The proposed models are applied to evaluate the eco-efficiency of a manufacturing 
company in an automotive industry.

Abstract 
 
Data quality in supply chains is getting greater attention from both industries and researchers. As poor data 
quality could cost a fortune for supply chain partners, the quality of the data is becoming an important 
research topic within the supply chain management literature. There are many benefits in having good data 
quality in supply chains such as cutting costs and improving responsibility and accuracy along the chain. 
Increasingly customers are demanding details for transactional data and the source of the manufactured 
products, including raw materials, suppliers, etc. Having good data quality helps create efficient supply 
chains with greater accuracy and transparency. As there exists limited literature surveys in the supply chains 
and data quality contexts, this study explores data quality in supply chains through literature survey and 
bibliometric review. The bibliometric analysis for data quality has been proceeded employing a 
visualization software to elucidate the prominent keywords, publication trends, authors and their 
cooperation and active countries in this field. The study reveals some interesting findings about the direction 
and trends of data quality in supply chains and emerging research themes, leading countries, key authors 
and emerging research topics in this field.

Abstract 
 
Dissimilar metal welds (DMWs) are commonly employed in various scenarios including the power plants and 
petrochemicals sector. However, DMWs have been reported for premature failures because of the stresses generated 
in the weld region owing to the high variation in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the different welded 
pipes’ materials. To overcome the problem of high CTE difference in the weld region some researchers have 
demonstrated the use of the interlayers between the welded pipes which gradually varies the CTE. In this paper, 
dissimilar metal welding of 2.25Cr-1Mo steel (CTE = 12 µm/m˚C) and Alloy 800H (CTE = 14.4 µm/m˚C) materials 
is studied which have a large difference of 20% between their CTEs. To overcome the effect of the high CTE 
difference between the 2.25Cr-1Mo steel and Alloy 800H, four interlayer materials are added in the weld region, 
namely; Inconel 625 (12.8 µm/m˚C)/ Inconel 718 (13 µm/m˚C)/ Inconel 600 (13.3 µm/m˚C)/ and Nimonic-PE16 (13.8 
µm/m˚C). This results in the gradual variation of the CTE from 2.25Cr-1Mo steel to Alloy 800H. However, no 
previous research is reported which studied the effect of the thickness of the interlayers on the distortion generated in 
the weld/joint. This study employs the finite element (FE) analysis to study the effect of the interlayers’ thicknesses 
on the distortion developed in the joint. For this purpose, a fully coupled temperature-displacement analysis is used. 
Furthermore, the FE analysis is conducted under the commonly encountered service conditions in the power and 
petrochemical sectors, i.e., superheated steam passing through the pipe at a temperature of 454˚C and pressure of 
21.55 MPa. To systematically study the effect of the interlayers’ thicknesses, a Taguchi L9 design of experiment 
(DOE) approach is employed by using the levels of thickness as 40 mm, 70 mm, and 100 mm for each interlayer 
material. The results of the FE analysis reveals that varying the interlayers’ thicknesses between the 2.25Cr-1Mo steel 
and Alloy 800H have a significant effect on the distortion produced in the joint. Moreover, optimization analysis 
revealed that employing the interlayers’ thickness combination of Inconel-625 = 100 mm, Inconel-625 = 40 mm, 
Inconel-625 = 40 mm, Nimonic = 40 mm lead to minimum distortion of 2.27 mm in the joint.

1. Introduction 
High performance is a must to be fulfilled requirement for materials employed in tough working conditions of power 
plants and petrochemical sectors where 475˚C temperature and 215.5 bars pressure are commonly occurring 
conditions (Hilkes and Volker 2009; Lippold 2014). The situation is more aggravated when the materials are subjected 
to the temperatures that are not constant rather keep varying from room temperatures to high temperatures of 
superheated steam in power plants. Ceramics based materials usually cannot be employed under temperature reversal 
conditions. Furthermore, it is not economically viable to make steam handling equipment such as pipes with ceramics 
due to their poor manufacturing properties such as lack of weldability due to extremely high melting points. Only few 
metallic materials conform to such tough working conditions. Low alloy ferritic 2.25Cr-1Mo steel is used extensively 
as a structural material in steam generating system of power plants and petrochemical industries (Nelson, Lippold, 
and Mills 2000). Similarly, austenitic stainless steel 800H is employed in the heat exchangers (Tillack and Guthrie 
1998). This necessitates the fabrication of dissimilar metal weld (DMW) between ferritic and austenitic steels. When 
the DMWs are developed by using the conventional welding techniques such as fusion welding, the experience has

deformation behavior is prominently visible between Figure 5(a) and (b). This shows that the change in the interlayers’ 
thicknesses can have significant effect on the distortion produced in the joint.  
 
A comparison of the relative distortion produced in the joint for the L9 simulations is shown in Figure 6. It can be 
seen that by changing the interlayers’ thicknesses both the pattern and the magnitude of the distortion changes in the 
joint. This shows that the interlayers’ thickness significantly affects the distortion produced in the joint. From the L9 
simulation results it can be said that the combination of the interlayers thicknesses in run-2 yields the lowest distortion 
in the pipe. It can be noticed that the maximum distortion is always produce towards the alloy 800H side. This could 
be due to its lowest yield strength among all the materials used in the joint (see Table 1). Therefore, under the high 
thermal stresses the alloy 800H side shows the highest deformation.  
 
 
Figure 6: Comparison of the distortion results for L9 runs. Left end 2.25Cr-1Mo steel and right end alloy 800H. 
 
After the completion of the FE simulations of the L9 experiments, it was attempted to find the optimum combination 
of the interlayers’ thicknesses for minimizing the distortion in the joint. For this purpose, a response optimization was 
run by using the desirability approach in Minitab for minimizing a single objective, i.e., distortion. The thickness 
values determined by the response optimizer for the interlayers are; Inconel-625 = 100 mm, Inconel-625 = 40 mm, 
Inconel-625 = 40 mm, Nimonic = 40 mm. The FE analysis was re-run at the optimized values of the interlayers’ 
thicknesses. The FE results shows the distortion in the joint reduced to 2.27 mm at the proposed optimum interlayers’ 
thicknesses. It should be noted that this value of distortion is less than any of the combination of the L9 experiments 
as can be seen in Figure 6. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this study a finite element model is presented to study the influence of the friction welded Ni-alloys based 
interlayers’ thicknesses in between dissimilar materials of 2.25Cr-1Mo ferritic steel and austenitic Alloy 800H. The 
following main conclusions could be drawn.

Abstract 
 
Different industries have increased interest to utilize shape memory alloy, nitinol, due to its abilities like morphing, 
superelasticity, high corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. On the other hand, Ti-6Al-4V has high tensile strength 
and toughness, high corrosion resistance, good biocompatibility, and low specific weight. For these reasons, Ti-6Al-
4V gets a lot of attention from industries like aircraft and medical engineering. Joints of these two widely different 
alloys should then offer unique advantages for highly specialized applications. However, problems related to the 
joining of dissimilar metals like nitinol to Ti-6Al-4V have restricted the widespread use of these alloys. Differences 
in metallurgical properties and coefficient of thermal expansion, as well as the tendency to form brittle intermetallic 
phases during welding, lead to cracks in the welds. This mismatch related to the thermal and mechanical properties 
between dissimilar metals results in the weakening of the overall quality of the joint between these two metals. 
Therefore, knowledge on joining nitinol to Ti-6Al-4V should be expanded in relation to dissimilar metal joints to 
overcome these problems, and future solutions can be found. In this study, the shape memory effect and superelastic 
properties of nitinol are discussed, and how these might get affected during the welding of nitinol to Ti-6Al-4V are 
presented. An attempt is made to friction weld Nitinol to Ti-6Al-4V using friction welding technique. Both metals 
start to form flash indicating a positive response to the friction welding cycle and a narrow strip of intermixed zone 
seen to have formed at the weld interface.

1. Introduction 
 
Joining involving NiTi is associated with challenges because NiTi is very sensitive to any kind of thermo-mechanical 
treatments. The welding process can alter the shape memory and superelastic properties of the parent metal near and 
adjacent to the weld zone. For this reason, the welding of NiTi is considered to be fundamentally different from 
conventional alloys welding. In conventional alloys welding, it is not very much necessary that the chemical 
composition and microstructure of the welds match the base metal. However, the mismatch between the two regions 
basically affects the joint behavior in case of NiTi (Calkins and Mabe 2010). 
 
Fusion welding of NiTi alloys causes embrittlement from oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Over and above this, 
precipitation of brittle intermetallic compounds such as Ti2Ni and TiNi3 may result during the solidification of weld 
zone (Shinoda et al. 1992a). Plasma welding of NiTi to NiTi not only altered the transformation temperatures but also

for the vertical flow texture at the interface. Figure 4 confirms the proposition that a third kind of metallurgical zone 
has indeed formed at the interface. The scan electron microscope (SEM) image at very high magnifications reveals 
such a new kind of zone. An energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) line scan would be able to inform us about the 
chemical makeup of this zone. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
It can see that there is near-unanimous understanding that suitable welding technology for joining NiTi is lacking. 
Only when such a technology is made available, there would be a substantial jump in NiTi usage for wide-ranging 
applications, particularly in Bio-medical and aerospace fields. Although attempts are seen in open literature as early 
as 1991, they are still few and far between. Fortunately, the recent past is seeing an increased frequency of reports on 
welding of NiTi, at least in the open literature to these authors’ knowledge. Aerospace companies are one of the 
prominent pushers to develop joining technology for NiTi. Adaptive serrated nozzle development being a case in 
point. 
  
Though quite a few existing joining technologies were tried joining NiTi as discussed above, only few among them 
offer promising results. Laser could be said to be one of the best-joining methods for similar welding. Especially, thin 
sections of NiTi were quite successfully joined. The laser beam’s capacity to melt instantaneously is its main strength. 
The homogenous structures seen in similar welds of NiTi more than prove this point. However, laser welding may not 
lead itself well in joining thick sections. Poor laser interaction properties of NiTi would be one among other reasons 
why laser welding suffers in those conditions. Further, it can be reasonably concluded that laser welding did not prove 
to be a worthy candidate when called upon to join NiTi to a different material. 
 
Solid-state welding processes such as friction welding and friction stir welding showed some initial and promising 
results. The near-absence of fusion zone formation puts these processes a step ahead from the rest. This way the 
formation of intermetallic phases from the solidifying molten pool can be bypassed which is the first and foremost 
benefit when joining dissimilar materials. Notwithstanding their benefits, solid-state welding processes are not 
completely problems free. Chances of formation of new phases still exist, though reduced to a large extent. This is 
because, large plastic deformation associated with near fusion temperatures creates solid-state diffusion paths in 
dissimilar joints. One of the other significant advantages in league with friction welding and friction stir welding 
techniques is their ability to join comparatively thicker sections. 
 
Hence, as future scope proposed that friction welding could be developed as a joining route for NiTi to itself and Ti-
6Al-4V. Although the immediate applications for these joints are in aerospace field for realizing adaptive serrated 
nozzle, the accruing benefits can also be extended to the bio-medical field. The reason being that is both NiTi and Ti-
6Al-4V have excellent biocompatibility. 
 
The initial experiments presented in this work, show promise in realizing strong joint between Ti-6Al-4V and Nitinol. 
When welding parameters are within an optimum window, both the parent metals start to form flash indicating a 
positive response to the friction welding cycle. Even though, an intermixed zone was seen to have formed at the weld 
interface, it was only a narrow strip. It is hoped that with further developments regarding the welding trials, we will 
generate better understanding of the behavior of this intermixed zone and how it will affect the mechanical properties.

Abstract 
The No-Hands Health Helper aims to provide a more efficient way to go through the COVID-19 screening process as 
well as to help prevent the spread of it. The system contains two main components. The first component is a 
questionnaire that is filled out through your computer to ensure the user completes it at home. Failure to pass the 
questionnaire will have the user’s results sent via email to HR and the user telling them not to come in. Passing the 
questionnaire will result in two emails. One email contains a copy of the questionnaire results and the other a QR code 
that will allow the user to utilize the screening component of our system. The second component of the system is a 
physical device the user interfaces with, at the office, prior to entering the building. A passive infrared sensor (PIR) is 
used to initiate the physical part of the screening process. Once the PIR sensor detects motion, a screen that is mounted 
to the top of the system and encased in a 3D printed box will prompt the user to scan the QR code. Once the second 
device is activated, the system will verify that the QR code has not been used yet and meets the other requirements 
through use of the SQL database. The requirements are current date, time span of two hours, and user’s name is not 
duplicated. If the QR code has already been used, the system will not continue, otherwise the QR code will be saved 
and the second part of the system will continue. The system will take the user’s temperature through a thermal camera. 
If the user passes the standards set, the system will dispense hand sanitizer through the use of an optical sensor, relay, 
and mini submersible pump. The hand sanitizer is dispensed for as long as the optical sensor detects the object. The 
system will also provide a mask using a micro servo motor and a 3D printed rack and pinion. Our components are 
controlled by a raspberry pi and an Arduino. The entire system is powered by the DC power source provided by an 
outlet and is fed into two buck converters, which regulate voltage, and is distributed by our printed circuit board 
(PCB). The system is enclosed in a plywood box with various holes for the components. It is lightweight and therefore 
easily portable. This design helps make the screening process more efficient while helping stop the spread of the virus.

Abstract  
 
This paper analyzes the demand for higher security protocols for purchases made online using a credit card. 
Current issues obscuring progress in credit card security include the lack of adoption of EMV chip 
technology world-wide, loop holes still existing in the EMV chip algorithms, sale of credentials over the 
black market, counterfeiting, and abuse by close family members. A new protocol is proposed whereby 
users are required to present their EMV chipped credit card at a virtual payment gateway or physical point 
of sale. Furthermore, in case the purchases come under the threat of a man-in-the-middle attack, a biometric 
scan of the user’s fingerprint will also be mandatory to authenticate the credentials. Thus, hacks involving 
EMV vulnerabilities such as pre-play attacks and image capturing can also be eliminated. This protocol is 
revolutionary in that biometric security involving fingerprint matching in a biometric database using SDK 
in conjunction with EMV chip readers such as SecuGen and e-commerce websites programmed in Java 
have never been used simultaneously to process credit card purchases. Additionally, end-users’ attitudes 
towards adopting the proposed solution indicate that for the sake of security, authentication using both a 
card reader and fingerprint scan is preferable over current practices.

Abstract  
 
Increased global flaring is a major source for greenhouse gas emission and airborne pollutants that have been proven 
difficult to mitigate. A promising way of reducing the flare is to convert it into a useful product or generate electricity. 
In this work, the feasibility study of converting flare gas to methanol is discussed. Aspen Hysys is incorporated to 
simulate a methanol plant with the help of feed stock data obtained from two oil fields. Economic Analysis is 
performed over the data to determine the total cost involved for production.  Payback period and net present value 
(NPV) are appraised according to different scenarios (1) Without considering an environmental tax and (2) With 
considering the environmental tax. A sensitivity analysis is deployed over economic and technical data. The results 
show that the flow rate and the methane percentage of input gas have a great influence on profitability of the plant. 
Increase in feed gas flow rate will increase the methanol production. This novel method reduces flare gas emission 
into the atmosphere. In addition, by considering environmental taxes the possibility of getting feasible economics 
becomes more realistic.

1. Introduction  
The flare gas or flare stack is the flammable waste gas which is liberated as the result of unplanned over pressurizing 
of plant equipment in petroleum refineries, chemical plants, and natural gas processing facilities [1]. These gases are 
vented out through a pressure relief valve [2]. Flaring of gas is vulnerable to human health as well as ecosystem near 
the flaring sites [3]. Flare gas contains oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxides of sulfur (SOx), greenhouse gases (CH4 and 
CO2), volatile organic compounds, H2, and dangerous particulate matter which are released directly into the 
atmosphere [4]. Gas flaring contributes to about 1.2% of the global CO2 emissions [5]. The most recent data reported 
by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) indicated that approximately 3.4×1012 cubic feet of natural gas are 
flared annually, which was about 2.7 percent of all natural gas production in the world [6, 7].  Figure 1 depicts the 
earth observation satellite data of the top ten gas flaring nations.  
Figure 1. Satellite data of top 10 gas flaring nations (2009-2011) and Annual CO2 emission [7]. 
 
Although flaring at refineries is generally limited and closely regulated in developed countries, gas flare reduction in 
the oil production and refinery industry is still of great interest due to the environmental regulations and economic

Abstract 
 
Cold exposure has implications to worker’s health, safety, and occupational performance for the reason that it can 
cause injuries. Interestingly, an extension of the Protection Motivation Theory was used to evaluate the factors that 
affect the ergonomic risk behaviour of the employees and their task performance in a cold storage warehouse facility. 
Structural Equation Modeling was then utilized to analyze the interrelationship among threat appraisal, coping 
appraisal, ergonomic risk behaviour, and cold storage task performance. An online questionnaire was distributed and 
a total of 255 data samples were collected. The results of the SEM indicated that threat appraisal and coping appraisal 
had significant direct effects on the task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. However, the results 
also showed that PMT had a significant indirect effect on the cold storage employees regardless of having the latent 
ergonomic risk behaviour as not significant. In addition, ergonomic risk behaviour was also found to have no 
significant direct effect on the task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. Hence, a risk assessment 
was conducted to identify the cold storage hazards and risk factors and to formulate cold storage operations 
improvements incorporating these influencing factors on task performance.

1. Introduction 
The cold chain is a process that is used to store and preserve chilled and frozen foods in cold storage warehouses to 
ensure food safety, quality, and shelf life for consumers (Beasley, 1998; Hongxia Zhao et al., 2018; James & James, 
2010). Some foods, whether they are frozen or refrigerated, have variable temperature requirements. Ice cream, for 
example, should be kept at a lower temperature than frozen vegetables (Salin & Nayga, 2003). The cold chain's 
integrity must be maintained from the point of manufacturing or processing, through all transport phases (e.g., loading, 
unloading, handling, and storage), and into storage at the consumer's home or restaurant. 
 
Cold storage capacity grew by 66 million cubic meters in 2018, to 616 million, which is 2.67% over 2016. According 
to Salin (2018), India was the largest at 150 million cubic, then the United States, and China accounted for the rest at 
105 million cubic meters, which accounted for 60% of the refrigerated space. While the earlier cold storages were 
concentrated more in the rural areas and near the site of food production in the Philippines, modern-day facilities have 
begun founding themselves in the heart of the country, including densely populated areas of Metro Manila, Metro 
Cebu, and Central Luzon.  
 
The fast-growing cold chain industries in the Philippines have been driven by the contribution of both government 
and private sectors. The formation of the Cold Chain Association of the Philippines (CCAP) with over 100 captive 
and non-captive companies as members and the Philippine National Cold Chain Program launched in 2004 by the 
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food for Progress has been one of the keys defining moments for 
cold chain industry. With the rise in competitiveness in the market, there has been a need for more efficient supply 
and storage, and an expansion of innovative technologies. One of the trends in cold storage warehouses is to espouse 
an intelligent system, as well as the automatic control of refrigeration systems, automatic safety monitor and protection 
system, automatic information retrieval system, and automatic transportation system (Zhao et al. 2018; Fan, 2013).

1471","6. Conclusion 
Like many hands-on jobs and working environments, working at a cold storage facility poses several potential health 
and injury risks for employees performing typical daily activities. With regular use of heavy equipment, exposure to 
extremely cold temperatures, damp, slippery surfaces, workplace injuries, and mishaps in cold storage facilities can 
be common – employees experience accidents like falls, overexertion, or cold-related adverse health effects. This 
current study integrated Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to evaluate ergonomic factors affecting the ergonomic 
risk behavior and task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. The results of the Structural Equation 
Modeling (SEM) indicated that threat appraisal and coping appraisal had significant direct effects on the task 
performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. However, the results also showed that PMT had a significant 
indirect effect on the cold storage employees regardless of having the latent ergonomic risk behavior as not significant. 
In addition, ergonomic risk behavior was also found to have no significant direct effect on the task performance of the 
employees in a cold storage facility. These findings serve as an opportune reminder that safety climate scores do not 
always fully portray actual levels of safety behavior, implying that the use of several performance indicators to justify 
safety climate measures may be necessary. 
 
A risk assessment was also conducted in a cold storage facility to understand the common cold storage health and 
safety risks identified from the result of the SEM and incorporate strategies and guidelines to avoid personal injuries, 
ensure a working environment, and have efficient daily operations.  
 
6.1 Recommendations  
The findings of this study indicate that safety climate perceptions will not necessarily match actual ergonomic risk 
behaviour and safety task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. It is suggested that the cold storage 
warehouse management should focus its primary safety improvement effort on changing unsafe situations and 
conditions, and on preventing ergonomic related disorders. The above will help improve people’s safety behaviour as 
well as cold storage employee attitudes and perceptions.  
For future research- explore additional factors and relationships such as worker involvement to safety behaviours, 
safety awareness, and management commitment to ensure a safe environment for all of their employees at work.

Abstract 
 
Today’s global market requires the ability to adapt to high production volumes, product variety, increase 
product quality and decrease production time to market for the assembly system. The increase of demand for the 
product quality and variety is 2P product related requirements, meanwhile increase of demand for the production 
volume and decrease production time to market time is 2P production related requirements. This paper defines these 
requirements as “2+2P” a main research problem of the assembly system. As well as, the future assembly systems 
need to fulfill capability and capacity flexibility of the market. The empirical studies have documented that human is 
the most flexible element of the manufacturing systems and they are responsible for capability flexibility, while 
machines are good at repetitive tasks and they enhance the capacity flexibility. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to 
examine the increase of human centered automation levels in manual assembly system, with the integration of ARM 
manipulator using System Modeling Language. In this study, an assembly, conventionally having a lower degree of 
automation, is investigated for human and arm interaction for productivity gains keeping constant flexibility. The 
integration methodology is based on System Modeling Language (SysML), for specifying analyzing, designing and 
verifying hybrid system. The station layout, tooling design and manipulator programming are elaborated using 
digital Solid works and Process Simulator tools. The motivations as well as the benefits derived from the 
employment of the arm manipulator into industrial case are discussed. The proposed methodology allows decrease 
of cycle time from 900 seconds to around 470 seconds, increase productivity, ergonomics of the assembly cell and 
increases the product quality by reducing human involvement by 23%.

1. Introduction  
Manufacturing systems have continuously evolved over time together with changes of market trends and 
technological advances: one can observe that paradigm shifts in production were always triggered by great 
innovations, referred to as industrial revolutions, and had great impacts on both society and economy (Dalenogare, 
Benitez, Ayala, & Frank, 2018; L. Yang, 2017; Vaidya, Ambad, & Bhosle, 2018). The automobile production 
cannot be excluded from this competition. The assembly of automobiles, experience several challenges, such as the 
different product mix, thousands of different parts, growing complexity of their processes and supply networks, 
increasing customer expectations for quality, lead-time and customization (Salmi, David, Blanco, & Summers, 
2015; Scholz-Reiter & Freitag, 2007). In order to response ”2+2 P” industrial problems in Figure 1, recently several 
advanced technologies have been emerged. For instance, the assistant technologies of the manual assembly systems, 
for higher automation (Gorlach, Wessel, Mandela, Elizabeth, & Africa, 2008) multiple performance aspects have to 
be investigated into and optimized with respect to metrics such as cost, productivity, quality, safety and ergonomics 
(Guney & Ahiska, 2014). Besides, the final assembly operations require more flexible and robust process 
(Hermawati et al., 2015) and humans are recognized as the most flexible element in a production system (Müller, 
Vette, & Mailahn, 2016). Therefore, in order to keep flexibility of the assembly systems, we cannot exclude humans. 
Flexibility is needed in assembly systems because of “2+2 P” industrial problems. According to Malik & Bilberg  
(2019) there are two types of flexibility exist: the capability flexibility and the capacity flexibility. The capability 
flexibility refers to the system ability to rapid react to market changes in terms of product variants and quality. The

The Figure 8, represents us final industrial experiment result for ARM and human integration. The blue line 
represents the actual results the cycle time while red line is the simulation result. From the Figure 8, we can say that 
actual cycle time is varying between 469 and 476 seconds for ARM and human collaborated system, while the 
actual cycle time for manual assembly system was 900 second, so we can say that cycle time is about halved with 
hybrid system. 
5. Conclusion 
The proposed methodology for ARM robot and human collaboration in an assembly cell enables the 
introduction of a robot and human task model in a unified structure. The intelligent decision-making algorithm 
allows human to robot physical task allocation and cooperation in the same workspace. In addition, the proposed 
method is oriented towards the human task allocation and execution, taking into consideration the safety aspects 
according to the related safety norms. The average resource utilization per task for the selected alternative 
scheduling is illustrated in Figure 9. In comparison to the manual assembly case, the time required for a human to 
perform a task is reduced by 23%.

1492","The identified advantages of this study can be summarized as follows: 
• 
The potential improvements on suspension assembly cell would help in reducing the cycle time of the 
process, but without keeping the cost of tooling low, as in the proposed layout. The actual cycle time is 
varying between 469 and 476 seconds for ARM and human collaborated system, while the actual cycle 
time for manual assembly system was 900 second. 
• 
The ARM and human physical task allocation methodology was proposed based on capability 
characteristics. 
• 
Since human being is more responsible for product quality, by decreasing 23% human tasks, the quality of 
the final product increased. 
• 
Increase automation level in manual assembly stations. 
• 
The cost-efficient cell by decreasing the number of operators from 3 to 1. 
• 
Improving ergonomics for human. 
• 
ARM workspace can be extended as it is equipped with an external rotary axis that allows the ARM to

Abstract  
Characterization is mandatory to exploit potential of natural fibers since most them don’t have available datasheets. 
Coping with diameter disparity, lumen and their nature, the strength values of single natural fibers fluctuates 
substantially in a wide ranges. But, stiffness is relatively stable that it can be used to describe fibers and to make 
profound comparison among materials. Hence, appropriate stiffness estimation is needed and result accuracy is 
depending on various parameters that allow to calculate in a deterministic way. This paper describes a strategy to 
enhance stiffness estimation accuracy and precision employing direct and indirect measurement methods jointly with 
digital image correlation techniques. Enset fiber is used to display the efficacy of the methods. Using these methods, 
materials with known stiffness are considered as a benchmark and above 5% accuracy enhancement has been achieved 
compared with conventional method. The effect of errors can potentially lead to wrong conclusion about the properties 
of the material. Plus, the effect of each of the influencing parameter on stiffness result has been characterized. Thus, 
stiffness can be used to typifies the tensile property of a fiber and its estimation accuracy, which can be enhanced 
using digital image correlation, plays significant role to compare materials.

1. Introduction 
Due to the increased consciousness of environmental aspect importance and ecological advantages of using renewable 
resources, there has been a renewed interest in natural fibers (Kumar & Anbumalar, 2015). Also, the need to replace 
petroleum based energy systems used in the production of synthetic materials by eco-friendly alternatives is a strong 
motivation in favor of natural materials (Monteiro et al., 2010). Natural fibers are not abrasive to the processing 
equipment, have neutral emission of CO2 and are an important source of income for the people living in rural areas 
(Alves Fidelis et al., 2013). Plus, fiber reinforced composites have been found to be the most promising material 
available and they are gaining more attention as demands for light-weight materials with high strength for specific 
applications are growing (Rajak et al., 2019). 
Polymer-based composite materials are ideal for applications where high stiffness-to-weight and strength-to-weight 
ratios are required (Gloria et al., 2011). Rapid growth in manufacturing has led to the need for the improvement of 
materials in terms of strength, stiffness, and lower cost with improved sustainability (Rajak et al., 2019). Tendency to 
exploit the potential of natural fiber is increasing and growth of the natural fiber reinforced composite has made a 
substantial impact on the polymer composite research (Vigneshwaran et al., 2020). Natural fibers abundance and 
possibility to be used to reinforce polymers to obtain light, stiff and strong materials is appreciable (Maleque et al., 
2007). Indeed, far-ranging studies on natural fibers, including sisal, flax, kenaf, and bamboo, demonstrate that natural 
fibers possess amazing potential as an effective reinforcing phase in composite materials (Salih et al., 2020). The 
benefits of using lignocellulose fibers in place of synthetic fibers relate to their specific properties, such as light weight, 
low cost, high specific properties, low density, good thermal properties, eco-friendliness, and biodegradability (Salih 
et al., 2020). Due to their high specific strength and modulus, natural fiber reinforced polymer composites are receiving

the result direct and indirect method shows that the accuracy of 5-11% with average of 7% is achievable using digital 
image correlation techniques to find strain at failure and Stiffness as a result. 
 
Figure 5: Direct and Indirect method comparison  
4. Other factors  
4.1. Sample preparation and machine factors  
A. Gluing:- Unlike abrasive paper frame, the glue type used has to be carefully selected, when normal paper 
frame is used. The double sided glue allows slippage because normal 80g paper is very smooth. Conversely, 
use of potent glue, SICO MET 8300 fully can make the fiber rigid around grip and facilitate failure at the grip 
leading to premature failure. For Enset case, double side glue is used to straighten the fiber at the contact point 
of fiber and paper and SICO MET 8300 is used around the paper frame end.  
B. Optical Flag and speckle formation:- Optical flag type affects the correlation process. It is possible to prepare 
the optical flag by using TIPEX application followed speckle formation and dot making using the tick marker 
to make visible spot on the fiber. The one with TIPEX is better corelated.     
C. Fiber straightness:- Fiber straightness during attaching and gripping is critical to come up with an acceptable 
result. It affects the strain value estimation on both methods because the straightening stage itself is considered 
as elongation. Hence the fiber has to be straight during preparation and is expected to be straighten by using 
of a preload less than 0.01N.  
D. During digital image correlation process, images before elongation starts and after failure has to be first 
filtered. It is also advisable to make initial guess to check whether it is possible to correlate before starting the 
analysis and assist the correlation process if required. In case the initial guess face problems while correlating, 
going to the picture where the correlation stops and assisting with the  possible options available is required.     
5. Conclusion 
Estimation of natural fiber stiffness, specifically one of the major indicator of its property, can be affected by various 
factors. Error during density and weight measurement affects the diameter and in turn the stiffness value. One of the 
major reasons for the density result variation is the purging time and waiting time during pressure drop using the 
pycnometer. Similarly, digital image correlation reduces error emanated from cross head movement based strain and 
stiffness estimation.

Abstract 
 
Optimize inventory level, reduce the discrepancies in supply and demand and increase customer satisfaction are the 
most decisive key factors that impact significantly the overall performance and effectiveness of the firm. In this 
context, the concept of sales and operations planning (S&OP) was developed with the aim of supporting companies 
to improve their process, ensure operational flexibility and gain competitive advantage. This paper is intended to 
present a literature review of sales and operations planning covering the various maturity models developed in this 
field .A case study was included for the evaluation of S&OP process maturity in automotive manufacturing company 
using two selected models proposed by Grimson & Pyke (2007) and Wagner et al. (2014). The implementation of 
S&OP process in the studied company shows significant improvement in supply chain performance, resulted in a 17% 
improvement in forecast accuracy, 37.5% reduction in leftover stock and 17% improvement in delivery performance. 
In the last section, some gaps were identified and proposal for improvement was presented in order to advance the 
company maturity stage. The results of this study can be considered as a way to understand the different aspects of 
S&OP maturity models and provide guidance for researchers and practitioners in identifying gaps and opportunities 
for future research.

1- Introduction 
In the field of supply chain management, reducing inventory level and improving customer satisfaction become the 
most important goals for many companies due to the positive impact on supply chain performance improvement and 
efficiency of the firms (Thomé et al. 2012; Wagner et al. 2014; Vereecke et al. 2018). In this context, the concept of 
S&OP was developed with the aim to help companies improving their process, matching supply and demand and 
increase profitability (Thomé et al. 2012). The S&OP includes all process to establish the estimated production plan 
at the tactical level, linking the strategic objectives of the company with the operational issues of the production master 
plan to best balance the demand and offer (Feng et al. 2008).The implementation of S&OP is expected to lead to 
several benefits such as accurate forecast planning, match demand and supply, reduce obsolete stock and improve 
customer service level (Wagner et al. 2014; Muzumdar and Fontanella  2006; Thomé et al. 2012; Kristensen and 
Jonson 2018). 
In this paper we start by reviewing the S&OP and maturity models presented in the literature followed by an overview 
of different maturity models developed in the field of S&OP. In the next section, a case study approach was conducted 
in automotive manufacturing company; the objective is to evaluate the S&OP process maturity using two maturity 
models. In the final section, we provide a comparison of the result and concluding comments. 
2- Literature Review  
 
2-1- 
S&OP Background 
During the 1990s, the concept of S&OP gained more interest in many companies with the emergence of manufacturing 
resource planning (MRP II) and enterprise resources planning ERP systems (Olhager 2013; Thomé et al. 2012;

1503","For “people and organization” dimension, the company is classed in integrated level, roles and responsibilities are 
clearly defined for each process owner, and the S&OP team is highly involved in the process and recognized the 
benefits of S&OP implementation. In the last dimensions “ information technology” , the company is in consistent 
stage , using SAP ERP for integrated planning and linked modules , providing accessibility for all planning data in 
real time  , others tools are also available and linked with ERP supporting in data analysis and scenarios simulation. 
The maturity evaluation using Wagner et al. (2014) model is represented in table 7 and table 8. 
 
Given the classification of the four dimensions, the company S&OP is moving up from consistent to integrated 
maturity stage with total average score of 4.25. 
 
3-4- 
Comparison between Grimson and Wagner Model. 
 
In the overall, the result achieved using the two models are similar in term of S&OP maturity classification, this 
similarity is due to the fact that both models adopt conformable dimensions, although we noticed some differences 
comparing the two maturity models. The first distinction is related to the number of dimensions and stages, for 
Grimson and Pyke model ,they opted for five levels and five dimensions instead of six levels and four dimensions in 
Wagner model ,we also remarked the necessity of the integration of supply chain partner in the four dimensions of 
Wagner Model in order to achieve the highest advanced stage, Grimson and Pyke (2007) include this element of 
supply chain partner integration only in two dimensions : “meeting and collaboration “  and “ measurement”. 
Furthermore Wagner model brought up the master data management as a main factor to improve the maturity of 
“Information Technology” metric. Nevertheless, both models present a qualitative and subjective evaluation of S&OP 
maturity without any metrics values or numerical factors which help providing quantitative and certain information. 
 
3-5- 
Proposal for improvement  
 
 This evaluation provide the opportunity to assess the S&OP maturity level in the selected company and also to identify 
the gaps between current and next stages, in this context, below two recommendations are suggested to improve the 
S&OP maturity in the studied company. 
 
 
Integration of key suppliers and customers in S&OP process 
 
The integration of supply chain partners in the S&OP process is a key metric to have close relationship with them and 
more transparency regarding demand figures, urgent deliveries and critical parts ,considering that more than one 
hundred  customers and fifty suppliers are defined  for the studied company , we suggest to involve only the key 
suppliers and customers which are mainly impacting the key performance indicators such as delivery performance, 
supplier /customer backlog and forecast accuracy. An example is related to the galvanic raw material impacted by 
long lead time of six months, the demand fluctuations and delay of galvanic raw material deliveries are impacting 
directly the inventories level and customer deliveries, therefore it’s highly recommended to involve this key supplier 
in the S&OP process. 
 
 
New Product Introduction 
 
One of the crucial factors impacting the inventories and orders lead time is the management of new product 
introduction especially in the automotive industry characterized by volatile market demand. the studied company was 
confronted with low forecast accuracy for the new products and this is principally triggered by missing historical data 
which can generate over stocks in case of high demand plan or customer backlog due to unavailability of raw material 
and capacity reservation, for this reason we highly recommend the integration of NPI’s challenges in S&OP program 
, the aim is that all relevant parts are involved to align about new product launch phase ,in order to improve the forecast 
accuracy while limiting inventories and ensuring delivery lead times. 
 
4- Conclusions, Limitations and Future Research Direction 
 
A mature S&OP process is a key element to ensure the profit optimization and increase supply chain performance. 
Accordingly, the concept of S&OP has gained growing interest by several authors and companies over the recent 
years. Through this study we provided a summary of different S&OP maturity models based on literature review. An

1511","application of two maturity models proposed by Grimson and Pyke (2007) and Wagner et al. (2014) was conducted 
in automotive manufacturing company where S&OP is implemented since 2016. A detailed assessment of maturity 
stage was performed followed by comparison among the two models, next we identified which actions should be taken 
in order to jump up to the next maturity stage , this recommendations are related principally to the integration of key 
suppliers, customers and  also the consideration of new products challenges in S&OP process. As with any study, 
there are limitations, the S&OP process was evaluated only for one selected company and the interviews was 
conducted with only two members of S&OP team, considering the small sample size; the results are providing an 
elementary vision. Our perspective for next research is to extend this study by exploring additional case studies and 
survey researches using different maturity models in order to validate data and come out with new opportunities related 
to the maturity of sales and operation planning.

Abstract  
 
The covid-19 has accelerated the use of technology in education, which was previously only a lesson in class. 
Information and network infrastructure are related to the online education system. This reason replaces the usual 
face-to-face learning process. to date, and only a few researchers have explicitly built attitudes towards online 
education, especially implementation in elementary, junior high, and high schools. This research is essential and a 
particular case because they are still at an early age and adolescents whose mental maturity level is still unstable and 
independent like university students. The author proposes a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) model as 
technology base learning for elementary to middle school children combined with a game-based learning platform 
to support children's engagement. This model consists of several variables: Perceive valuable content, Perceived 
practical learning, perceive ease to use, attitude toward using online learning, trust, behavioral intention to use online, 
and perceived valuable game Kahoot as moderating variables. Children need trust and believe to make easier 
engagement and interactive communication with their teachers. This study looked at the perceived users of 
technology base learning and game-based learning users. They see the ability to learn engagement games to be 
happier and more enthusiastic in the educational process.

1. Introduction  
 
Children need education, but the conditions of the Covid-19 pandemic have prevented them from attending 
school as usual(Web 2020). Education must deliver regardless of the conditions. This condition has accelerated the 
use of technology in education for young children, which previously only served as classroom learning. Children 
usually need trust and trust in their teachers to follow their teachings(Ritanjali, Ranjan, and Kumar 2020). In terms 
of the face-to-face learning process, it is easier to work than in online learning. Teachers can adapt and communicate 
with children through fun activities and interactivity when they deliver content face-to-face, making it difficult 
online. New problems arise related to this online, namely how the acceptance of subject content goes well and the 
involvement of children to be happy with technology-based learning. The comfortable of children is not easy to 
happen. Children need motivation, encouragement, and support in learning in subject schools (Fang et al. 2008) 
because they have not become independent individuals like mature students in college(Engwall 2018). For the most 
part, the development of information technology is driving value online and accepted gradually through university 
teaching, but it may be somewhat different for young students in primary, junior high, and high schools. Luckily for 
them, the use of the internet and the worldwide web allows students to study subject content and interact with their 
teachers using a TAM-based technology learning platform (Fang et al. 2008).  The independent or adult age can 
accept online learning as usual, generally at the university level. The results of literature searches, mainly primary to 
secondary school children, are very few, especially in children in Indonesia, whose educational and technological 
infrastructure is generally not as good as in developed countries. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
 
The research objective is application of model TAM (fang, 2012) according to perceive of students in 
elementary, junior, and senior high school, this is the uniqueness of this research. It is very important to know the

Abstract  
 
Indonesia's ranking travel and tourism competitiveness report shows improvement, but level tourism competitive 
was lower in the world. Indonesia has weaknesses in terms of infrastructure and the supporting environment in market 
tourism. Hotel occurs to brand and price when consumer choice it. Option global brand includes in competitiveness 
market hotel business. Several local hotels had already changed the rebrand to a worldwide brand, but the occupation 
room decreased. This paper wanted to observe that international brand hotels can influence brand awareness through 
intent and purchase on service and product MICE hotel. Smart PLS version 3.0 as a running data tool used as a partial 
least square model. Range three months, we got 2300 customers of this hotel and using Slovin formula with a margin 
error of 10 % and the survey spread by questionnaire. The research has proven top of global brand significant 
influence on brand awareness through intent and purchase. Even though hotel rebranding with a worldwide brand is 
not influenced well by plan and buy, brand awareness could familiarize consumers with this hotel brand. Our 
suggestion strategy using the global brand is not enough to grab consumers. Excellent service and promotion hotels 
must capture by brand awareness of the consumer minds.

1. Introduction  
 
Tourism Sector Policy Direction of Indonesia continues to show improvement from year to year. The increasing 
number of foreign tourists in 2018 rose 12.58% or 15.81 million visits compared to 2017 of 14.04 million visits 
(Agency, 2019)and the competitiveness ranking of Indonesia's tourism sector globally (Agency, 2019). Also, the 
tourism sector can absorb labor significantly. Unfortunately, the tourism sector in Indonesia has a challenge because 
Indonesia has a potential tourism destination. The ranking of Indonesia's tourism sector competitiveness and the 
increasing number of tourists from year to year. Based on the Tourism Competitiveness Index issued by the WEF, 
Indonesia's ranking continues to increase from 74 in 2011 to 42 in 2017 and rise to rank 30 in 2019 (Figure 1). On 
the other hand, the number of tourists entering Indonesia continues to increase and expected to reach around 295 
million tourists, who contribute about 7.5% of GDP (Figure 2). 
 
Although Indonesia's ranking based on the 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report shows 
improvement, Indonesia still has weaknesses in infrastructure and the supporting environment for the tourism sector. 
Indonesia has a good rating regarding tourism and natural resources and cultural richness that can be a tourist 
attraction. Indonesia is ranked 66 and 87 out of 136 countries in terms of infrastructure and supportive environment, 
where the main problems are tourism infrastructure services such as lodging, health, and hygiene.

1518","regions. Tourism still considers a choice sector. It has not been considered a strategic sector that contributes 
meaningfully to regional development or the community's welfare. The strengthening of organizations in charge of 
tourism development does not distribute in various regions. As a result, cross-regional coordination in the integrated 
handling of cross-regional tourism assets also often faces obstacles and obstacles. 
 
On the other hand, the weak understanding of tourism often positions Tourism as a complementary sector that 
does not have a strategic position in the region's organizational structure. Tourism human resources and tourism 
higher education development are still limited. The story of Indonesian tourism is currently not balanced with the 
development of the human resources tourism sector. Human research development in tourism includes apparatus, 
industry, and public, which is helpful to support the development of tourism in the area. With the enactment of 
Community engagement economics (AEC), the demand for competent and capable human resources to compete with 
Overseas human resources will be increasingly required. Therefore, the preparation of Tourism HR in quantity and 
quality must be encouraged as much as possible. Ineffective coordination and synchronization of cross-sector and 
regional development. The problem about coordination between the center and the regions arises because of the 
implementation of regional autonomy, and it depends on the principles of good governance with the Regional 
Autonomy Law, the authority to develop tourism products located in the Regions, while the marketing authority is 
in the center. This authority gives rise to regional arrogance to determine the direction of development and 
management of resources and their respective administrative territories, resulting in less growth of tourism activities 
between the Center and Regions well-coordinated. The government and the private sector must be trigger by 
development orientation.  The development orientation encourages each region to compete unfairly for attracting the 
tourist. The market must have area-specific policies that do not provide the convenience of tourist visits and even 
lead to exploiting excessive tourism objects that impact the decreasing carrying capacity and quality. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Challenges of the Tourism Developing Market must interpret as a challenge to maximize the benefits of global 
brands. Another target increase brand awareness, especially in the hospitality industry in the era of disruption, to 
compete with countries that are far ahead in the hospitality industry, such as the United States, Hong Kong, 
Switzerland, and others. Some approaches that must apply in realizing competitiveness are: first, ongoing market 
research obtains valid data and provides input following consumer trends and the latest updates. Second, effective 
communication strategies implement integrated programs with good coordination between marketing and 
communication tools to carry out promotions to convey the message of the products or services of the Hotel Industry 
offered to consumers as part of product/service image representation. The company's effort to integrate and 
coordinate all communication channels to convey its message consistently and strongly influences its products. Third, 
optimization of marketing strategies by having partners in synergy to build a better corporate image in the eyes of 
consumers. Fourth, the promotion that it still did partially to improve by conducting joint promotions with fellow 
existing hotels simultaneously and carried out together with tourism attractions that support the hospitality business. 
 The weaknesses in the development of tourism institutions are primarily in the hospitality industry. This industry 
must fix basic things. The formation of organizations that do not overshadow the field of tourism up to the regional 
level is not optimal. It can anticipate by increasing the role of local governments. In which organizational capacity-
building programs can implement according to the Ministry of Tourism. The grand strategy to improve the tourism 
sector is the number one contributor to foreign exchange in Indonesia. Second,  
 
competence human resources who have professional competence by doing certification of basic competence or 
hospitality managerial, to have a fast response in delivering the consumer need, have empathy for guests/consumers, 
understanding of the products/services offered to suit the needs of consumers to achieve guest satisfaction to make 
more purchases and ultimately provide positive recommendations for products/services provided by the hotel (3) 
coordination of cross-sectoral development between stakeholders: Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Communication 
and Information, Ministry of Labor and others, so that they are singular in their policy establishment and 
implementation. 
 
      In this case, the role of brand awareness must consistently increase if the Swiss-bell Hotel Bogor, always to be 
maintained and increase to increase intent to purchase for consumers, especially MICE products in Swiss-bel Hotel 
Bogor. By improving the quality of resources, facilities, business processes that aim to increase customer satisfaction, 
which in turn can provide recommendations for other consumers to use MICE products at the Swiss-bel Hotel Bogor.

Abstract 
 
This work shows a preoperative simulation procedure with Computer Aided Design (CAD) 3D software for a patient 
suffering from Ollier's disease. This pathology is very rare and occurs in extremely different ways depending on the 
case. Consequently, it is difficult to establish a correct surgical strategy that can be applied in a similar way to all 
patients. Computer Aided Surgical Simulation (CASS) process uses advanced modeling technologies to reproduce 
bony anatomy and simulate the surgery. The starting point is represented by the 3D digital model of the bone obtained 
from tomographic images. Through CAD modeling software such as Creo Parametric and following surgeons 
directives, engineers can provide doctors with orthopedic simulation and expectation of achievable surgical outcome. 
If virtual surgical prediction doesn’t meet doctors requirements, model is regenerated and it is possible to seek for a 
better solution. CASS process allow for extensive surgical planning, enhancing accuracy in theatre and enriching the 
amount of medical information that is needed to perform complex orthopedic procedures. In conclusion, the possibility 
to recognize in advance the overall orthopedic situation and outcoming expectancy represent an extraordinary upgrade 
of current surgical state of the art, leading to minimally invasive surgeries and patient-specific solutions.

1. Introduction  
Ollier's disease is a pathology characterized by the presence of intraosseous cartilage tumors called endocromes which 
can be extremely variable depending on the size, number, location, evolution, age of onset and diagnosis. For this 
reason, each case must be considered in its uniqueness and requires a particular and specific treatment. (Silve and 
Jüppner 2006, Kumar et al. 2015). This article considers a patient with femoral deformity caused by Ollier's disease. 
The research conducted by Angelini et al. (2020) led to a systemic literature review of articles dealing with patients 
with limb deformities caused by Ollier's disease. These patients were surgically treated with variable techniques, 
including osteotomies and external fixation, intramedullary nails, epiphysiodesis, and nail lengthening.  
 
In the case in question, the surgeons decided to proceed with a non-invasive treatment for the correction of the 
deformity of the femur. It was therefore decided to proceed with the insertion of an intramedullary nail designed to 
lengthen the femur with precision and control. 
In recent decades, the development of advanced information technologies has led to the growth of several sectors. In

1528","Following doctors guidelines, it was possible to choose from the catalog the suitable surgical tools: each screw and 
pin were appropriately sized on CREO and used in the simulation to provide a final model that best reflects the real 
examined situation and its solution (Figure 13).

6. Conclusion 
The simulation gave doctors an overview of the possible surgical outcome, complete with all the details and specific 
for the case under exam. The three-dimensional model, precisely dimensioned, allows an accurate analysis in pre-
operative planning phase with a consequent reduction of risks and unforeseen in surgery and therefore possible delays. 
Especially in diseases that affect multiple directions and that vary completely depending on the bone considered and 
the patient, it is glaring the usefulness of such an accurate simulation method. Being able to rely on a reproduction of 
the anatomy once operated also enhance the surgeon-patient communication.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 has introduced a new set of challenges in the business environment. Companies are looking for a 
management philosophy that could help in identifying and remove non-value-adding activities. The paper presents the 
application of the Lean Six Sigma tools and techniques in the South African logistic company based in Durban. The 
company has reported the challenge in meeting its business commitment which was further amplified by the Covid-
19 regulations which force the companies to operate with the reduced staff levels. The research used secondary data 
and questionnaires as data collection strategies. According to the findings, the company was unable to meet its 
availability target of 90 % to 100 %, with an average availability of 84 %, which was 6 % less than the threshold level. 
The number of defective vehicles ranged from 18 to 65 vehicles with and median of 40 vehicles per day. The company 
committed to keeping the number of defective vehicles under 10% of the total fleet size, and the results show that the 
company had an average of 16% defective vehicles, which was higher than 10%. Overall, the company was operating 
at a 2.45 sigma level with a quality level of 82.51 %, which meant 17.49% of the time was spent on defect repairs. 
The contribution of the research is the application of LSS to promote and encourage continuous improvement in the 
South African logistic industry.

1. Introduction
The Covid-19 has introduced a new set of challenges in the business environment. Companies are looking for a 
management philosophy that could help in identifying and remove non-value-adding activities.  Bhamu and Sangwan 
(2014), identify Lean Manufacturing (LM) as a management philosophy that is well recognized globally to deal with 
business challenges. The focus of LM is to identify waste in the business processes and other non-value-adding 
activities and remove them (Hussain et al., 2019). Morgan and Brenig-Jones (2012), argued LM has run its course 
from the 1950s, and during the 1980s the concept of Six Sigma (SS)  started to gain momentum as a quality 
improvement strategy. SS is a data-driven method that focuses on improving quality by identifying the root cause of 
variation in the processes. Sharma et al.(2021), maintain that LM is a knowledge-driven strategy while SS depends 
on data and statistical analysis. The authors recently discovered that LM and SS are compatible with each other and 
that using the combination maximizes the benefit (Snee, 2010; Morgan and Brenig-Jones, 2012; Hussain et al., 2019; 
Bhaskar, 2020). Lean Six Sigma (LSS) which is the combination of LM and SS has established itself as one of the 
well-known practices in the industry to eliminate waste and deal with process variation (Snee, 2010; Shokri and Li, 
2020).  Lean six sigma uses a structured methodology call define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC) 
to identify defects and improve processes (Garza-Reyes et al., 2016; Bhaskar, 2020). Shokri and Li (2020) maintain 
that LSS has demonstrated the ability to improve profitability, a safe working environment, effective utilization of 
resources, and customer satisfaction.  
 LSS has its origin in the manufacturing sector but over the years the strategy has found its way to different 
industries (Bhaskar, 2020; Sharma et al., 2021). For example, Abner et al.(2020), cited more than ten studies 
conducted in the financial sector between 2003 and 2019 on the implementation of LSS and its benefits. So me of the 
advantages of LSS in the financial sector include defect reduction, improved customer satisfaction, increased 
utilization of human resources, and a better business image. The study of 38 Mexican hospitals (Peimbert-García et 
al., 2019) and the savings of $ 530 thousand per annum as a result of LSS reported in (MVijaya and Kunnath, 2020) 
demonstrated a good adoption of LSS in the healthcare environment. Garza-Reyes, Al-Balushi, et al., (2016) reported 
the case study of the implementation of the LSS project in the ship loading environment in the Pelletising Industry

business processes. The secondary data findings were confirmed by primary data, demonstrating that the company 
was unable to effectively manage uncontrollable factors. We confirm that the research had both reliability and validit y 
based on the audit trail used to collect data, the process of ensuring the reliability of the questionnaire, and the 
similarities between different data sources. 
 
6. Conclusion  
According to the findings, the company was unable to meet its availability target of 90 percent to 100 percent during 
the period of observations, with an average availability of 84 percent, which was 6 percent less than the threshold 
level. The number of defective vehicles ranged from 18 to 65 vehicles with and media n of 40 vehicles per day. The 
company committed to keeping the number of defective vehicles under 10% of the total fleet size, and the results show 
that the company had an average of 16% defective vehicles, which was higher than 10%. Overall, the company was 
operating at a 2.45 sigma level with a quality level of 82.51 %, which meant 17.49% of the time was spent on defect 
repairs (Morgan and Brenig-Jones, 2012; Antony, Vinodh and Gijo, 2016). According to quality control documents, 
the depots had an average of 1.39 defects per unit, which was higher than the organization's target of zero defects. The 
analysis shows that special causes had an impact on company performance, which was confirmed by questionnaire 
results, which indicated that the company needed to improve its approach to m anaging uncontrollable factors. The 
results show that the factors influencing business performance are complex, making LSS an excellent quality 
improvement strategy for improving business performance. Future research should create a conceptual model of the 
factors influencing business performance based on the literature and the personal experiences of local experts, and 
then test the model with empirical data.

Abstract 
 
The echo absorption system is the reduction of echo and noise reverberation within a room and in doing so helps to 
reduce the volume of noise, whilst increasing the clarity. Firstly, sound absorption material is particularly important 
for large enclosed spaces such as classrooms, cinemas, and exhibition halls. These huge and spacious rooms are 
subjected to echo sounds, even a drop of a pen can make a huge sound in these rooms; so, an acoustic material is 
introduced to reduce such echo. Secondly, sea life is affected by plastic on a huge scale. Billions of tons of plastic 
have been used on earth which is affecting everything on earth like: humans, plants, trees, animals, sea life. To 
overcome such issues, we as human beings must do some efforts to reduce the waste of plastic. Every item comes in 
plastic bags e.g., disposal cups, grocery polyethylene's, plastic bottles, etc. In this century every engineer would like 
to introduce sustainable material to clients/investors to make a safe and healthy living environment. Using plastic as 
a construction material is relatively new. The main objective of the paper is to take the first step and reduce the plastic 
from the earth by recycling & reusing plastic to reduce pollution. By using this acoustic material, we can reach to ideal 
sound absorption level. This paper describes a sustainable material that has acoustic properties. This material is made 
of perforated wood panels, fabric, and recycled plastic. An airborne test is conducted to find the noise reduction 
coefficient (NRC). The target is to have absorption CLASS A standard, the very highest rating in sound absorption. 
The acoustic testing data are presented for different thicknesses of these layers which will be fixed above block walls.

1. Introduction  
Engineering is a tag that comes with many responsibilities not only aesthetic, design, and function both must be also 
considered. In this century every engineer would like to introduce sustainable material to clients/investors to make the 
environment safe & healthy greenhouse. So, in this project, waste plastic & old clothes are used as both can be easily 
found in homes, markets, restaurants, malls, etc. Using plastic as a construction material is relatively new. The aim of 
this paper is to make echo absorption classrooms in Universities by using perforated wooden panels, fabric panels 
which will be fixed on the block walls. University is a place which should be silent/peaceful to study well, focused 
and concentrated, especially in library halls. The main objective of the paper is to take the first step and reduce the 
plastic from the earth by recycling & reusing plastic to reduce pollution. Due to the increase in population, the 
government or private sector are making bigger scale colleges, the more the campus, the classroom sizes will also be 
bigger to fit more students. Bigger classrooms are subject to Echo sounds, even a drop of a pen can make a huge sound 
in classrooms. So, an echo absorption material is introduced in this paper. This material is aesthetically pleasing with 
technically proven, this is what in demand nowadays. This sustainable material will have a significant contribution to 
Civil Engineering.

1540","4.3. Discussion  
Table 5 describes different types of layers present in the sample shown in Figure 3. The above experiments are 
conducted for three different thicknesses of 19mm, 22mm, and 25mm of Rook wool and Recycled plastic & cotton. 
The graph in Figure 4 shows three of the tests conducted with different thicknesses for the material. Test was conducted 
for 15-20 mins until the sound level reach 0.00Hz. The more thickness of material can absorb more sound comparing 
to less thickness of acoustic & waste material. In first and second experiment with 22mm and 25 mm have reached 
frequency zero while the 19mm thick shows 0.12Hz; this shows the sound was not completely absorbed in the third 
experiment.

Figure 4: Comparison of sound absorption for different thicknesses of echo absorption material   
To improve the absorption in less time more thickness can be added but adding thickness means the wall thickness 
will be more than 55mm. It is recommended to use 22mm thick panels with 19mm thick Rockwool & 3mm recycled 
cotton & plastic because the cost will be less as compared to 25mm thick but results will remain the same only time 
what makes difference as the sound we play in the room is more than regular voice so in future sound frequency will 
be low in less time.  
 
5. Conclusion 
When designing a classroom, special attention is given to architectural acoustics to control noise and create a calmer, 
more peaceful environment for the students. Understanding sound isolation, mechanical noise and vibration control, 
and room acoustics is an essential component of designing any student housing facility. The above characteristics can 
be achieved with waste plastic & old clothes which helps to reduce the plastic waste from the earth. So, we have two 
benefits. Firstly, Echo Absorption system will be done and secondly, plastic can be reduced from earth & help to 
reduce global warming. This material can be used in many places like hotels, meeting rooms, hospitals, sports halls, 
music halls, museums, etc. The experiments are conducted for three different thicknesses of 19mm, 25mm, and 22mm 
of Rook wool & recycled Plastic & cotton. It is recommended to use 22mm thick panels with 19mm thick Rockwool 
& 3mm recycled cotton & plastic considering the cost and sound absorption.

Abstract 
 
This paper studies a two-echelon vendor managed inventory routing problem of a honey packager company that 
delivers packaged products from a single facility to multiple retailers and customers. The objective is creating a supply 
chain which minimizes the total distribution cost while satisfying customers’ demand on time through retailers. The 
complex nature of the problem originates from connecting the inventory management and the routing process which 
makes getting an exact solution to the problem difficult. We propose a mathematical optimization model and develop 
a three-step clustering-based math-heuristic algorithm to solve the problem since commercial solvers fail to provide 
high-quality solutions within a given time limit. The performance of the algorithm is tested with randomly generated 
dimensions. The algorithm yields (on average) 16% improvement compared to objective value performances of the 
commercial solver.

1. Introduction 
The inventory routing problem (IRP) is a variant of the vehicle routing problem, where the priority is on the vehicle’s 
routing as well as the inventory management. The inventory routing problem is defined as follows: A vehicle fleet of 
fixed capacities serve customers of fixed demand by the period from the central depot. Customers must be assigned 
vehicles and vehicles are routed so that the total route cost is minimized. These homogeneous vehicles deliver a single 
product to multiple customers depending on their consumption rate/orders. The route costs depend on the distance 
between customers or between customers and the depot (Malandraki and Daskin 1992). Determining and managing 
the optimum inventory amount are equally important as the routing process, where the inventory holding costs are 
significant and meeting customers’ demands perfectly are of paramount importance (Moin et al. 2011). In addition to 
these objectives, Ekici et al. (2015) shows that, the vehicle routes, delivery amounts and the starting and ending points 
of the vehicles can be tracked while not exceeding the inventory capacity for both warehouse(s) and vehicle(s) and 
avoiding product shortage over the designated periods. 
 
Due to the complex nature of the Inventory Routing Problem, several solution methods have also been introduced. 
The problem mentioned in Federgruen and Zipkin (1984) is a single day inventory routing problem with a limited 
amount of inventory. The solution proposed includes modified vehicle routing problem heuristics formulated as 
nonlinear integer programming which aims to minimize inventory holding, shortage and transportation costs while 
determining routes of each vehicle. Ghiani and Improta (2000) transforms the vehicle routing problem into a 
capacitated arc routing problem (CARP) and proposes an exact algorithm to solve the routing problem in and out of 
the clusters, treating the inside of the clusters as a generalized traveling salesman problem determining the least-cost 
throughout the circuit. Erdogan and Miller-Hooks (2012) states that the green vehicle routing problem (G-VRP) is 
formulated as a mixed integer linear program. The problem includes the modified Clarke and Wright’s savings 
heuristic and the density-based clustering algorithm (DBCA). DBCA separates the vehicle routing problem into 
routing and clustering. Crainic et al. (2011) studied a two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), and they solved 
their problem with a clustering algorithm. Their aim was to minimize the total transportation cost. In this article, first-
level vehicle routing is made between depot and satellites, and second-level vehicle routing is made between satellites 
and customers. Perboli et al. (2011) studies two-echelon vehicle routing problem which is an extension of a classic 
vehicle routing problem. Their transportation network has two levels. In the first level it is the connection from the

The Table 4 provides the results of the mathematical model and the proposed algorithm, the optimality gap of the 
mathematical model after running time of four hours in CPLEX, the amount of time it takes for the algorithm to solve 
the problem instance as seconds and the improvement on results of the proposed algorithm compared to the 
mathematical model. Note that, the percentile for improvement being positive means that the algorithm performed 
better as the smaller result is preferred for the minimization objective for the problem. The n, r, and t stand for the 
number of customers, number of retailers and the time horizon for the specific instance, respectively. The locations of 
the production center, retailers, and the customers on three randomly generated test instances are shown in Figure 2. 
The amount of time that is required for the proposed algorithm to solve the problem instance is highly dependent on 
the number of customers that are connected to any retailer. Even though for two different instances sizes are the same, 
computational time to get a solution may differ due to size of clusters imported to the algorithm to be solved. The 
Improv. column is included to observe the performance between two different solutions introduced in this paper. 
Although the computational time of the proposed algorithm may be high in specific instances, it is still much better 
than the original mathematical model solved in CPLEX. The goal for the algorithm was to reduce the computational 
time with minimum loss from optimal results. As a result, we decreased the computational time severely and 
consistently achieved better results than the 4 hours of run time in CPLEX for the original mathematical model. The 
algorithm’s routing results for the test instances in Figure 2 are available in Appendix A.

4. Conclusion 
The two-echelon vendor managed inventory routing problem is discussed in this paper, and the clustering-based math-
heuristic algorithm consists of three parts is proposed. The first phase constructs clusters including a single retailer 
and multiple customers in each. The customers are paired with their corresponding retailers using a utility-based 
function. The second step solves the routing problem in each cluster independently and the third step solves the routing 
problem between each cluster’s retailer and the production center. The proposed algorithm achieves an on average 
16% improvement compared to mathematical model’s four hours performance in commercial solver CPLEX on all 
instances run, while decreasing computational time to minutes. The proposed math-heuristic algorithm is compared 
with the initial model in several instances to yield a proper estimate about the performance of the algorithm.

Abstract 
Electronic waste (e-waste) is a potential source of valuable and critical materials such as gold, silver, platinum group 
metals, copper, and rare earth elements. In Canada, however, less than 20% of generated e-waste is recycled. There 
exists a need for an efficient, sustainable e-waste metal recovery process that could be deployed on a regional scale 
to incentivize collection and recycling. In this paper, a process model was developed in MATLAB to simulate the 
electrochemical recovery of base and precious metals from printed circuit boards (PCBs) using regenerated Fe3+ 
oxidant. In the modelled process, Fe3+ ions are regenerated at the anode of an electrolytic cell while extracted metals 
are recovered on the cell cathode. A two-stage process using unique electrolyte solution for each allows base metals 
(Cu, Sn) and precious metals (Ag, Au, Pd) to be recovered separately. The process model was able to predict 
economic and environmental performance of the process given a set of feed conditions and operating parameters. 
Monte Carlo analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to determine key operating parameters and optimal setpoints 
for a final design. The final design was environmentally and economically feasible, with an estimated net annual 
profit of CA$ 321,000 after tax, and a carbon intensity 57.7% lower than the conventional pyrometallurgical process 
used for e-waste metal recovery.

1. Introduction
Electronic waste (e-waste) consists of various types of electronic equipment which have been discarded. E-waste is 
the fastest growing waste stream in the world; this growth can be attributed to widespread adoption of electronics 
across the globe and a relatively short lifespan for many of these products (Bel et al. 2019). E-waste streams present 
significant potential environmental and health harms because they contain many hazardous materials which may 
seep into the surrounding environment if they are disposed of improperly. These hazardous components include 
lead, cadmium, mercury, and hazardous organic compounds like flame retardants (Islam et al. 2019). At the same 
time, e-waste presents an economic opportunity; a 2019 report released by the Platform for Accelerating the Circular 
Economy estimated the material value of global e-waste accumulation at € 55 billion (Bel et al. 2019). The rise of 
electronics and e-waste has coincided with a decline in the availability of mineral resources needed to produce 
electronics (Kumar and Holuszko 2016). These same valuable and scarce resources are present in much higher 
concentrations in e-waste than they are in ores extracted from mines, meaning recycling of e-waste has the potential 
to be much more efficient. An estimated 60-95% of energy usage could be reduced by recovering metals from e-
waste versus extracting the metals from the earth using traditional methods (Khaliq et al. 2014). 
Canada is a large producer of e-waste, producing 725 kilotonnes in 2014 (Kumar and Holuszko 2016). Through a 
variety of provincial recycling programs and initiatives, an estimated 14% of this e-waste is collected annually 
(Kumar and Holuszko 2016). The low collection rate for e-waste in Canada is in part due to an insufficient capacity 
for e-waste processing and a lack of economic incentive for collection – especially the collection of smaller e-waste 
streams. In Canada, the conventional process for metal recovery from e-waste employs pyrometallurgical smelting 
units. One pyrometallurgical recycling plant, the Glencore Copper Horne Smelter in Quebec, processes over 
100,000 tonnes of e-waste material annually (Glencore Recycling 2020). While these plants individually have a 
large capacity for e-waste processing, they also have high energy intensities and emissions rates. Additionally, they 
are generally not economical below an estimated 30,000 tonnes of waste per year due to a high operating and capital 
costs (Ghodrat et al. 2016). Relying on a centralized collection scheme directing e-waste to large-scale 
pyrometallurgical plants will inevitably allow a large fraction of smaller e-waste streams to “slip through the 
cracks”.

different from those modelled and using the technical model to simulate these ranges and identifying the system 
limits will be useful for evaluating the designs’ feasibility. Additionally, investigating the benefits of process 
solution reuse rates over multiple loading cycles will enable a more refined understanding of the design and 
economics. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper focused on the design of an alternative small-scale, low-emissions process for the recovery of metals for 
e-waste that was economically feasible. Overall, the results of modelling have predicted that the proposed design 
was able to meet the design constraints and success criteria and is thus economically and environmentally feasible 
and likely to be profitable. The modelling predicted a carbon intensity under half of the current industrial route, 
while economic metrics suggested a payback period of under 2 years. Coupled with the potential social benefits of 
the current work, the design’s achievement of metric targets provides a clear incentive for further investigation. 
 
While overall findings are very positive, the modelling done cannot conclude that the proposed design would be 
feasible in practice. As has been discussed above, several assumptions were made to simplify the model into a 
solvable state. Additionally, there are many aspects of practical design and logistics that were not considered – for 
example, the ability to procure a steady supply of PCBs. If the processis to be developed further, it would be 
important to conduct more detailed environmental and economic analyses to support the design and validate the 
benefits of this processing method. Resolving the model limitations as discussed previously will be critical for 
improving the confidence in design feasibility, profitability, and sustainability, and will highlight routes for further 
refinement in this space. Validating the behavior of the system through lab and bench testing will be critical to 
verify expected performance and optimize the design for future process scale-up activities.

Abstract  
 
Since the appearance of the coronavirus pandemic, the activity of several companies has experienced a 
remarkable decline. This decline is due especially to several reasons linked to several social, tourist, and 
preventive factors. 
To do this, to find solutions to minimize losses and achieve the objectives, and above all to ensure the 
continuity of the desired results, we opted for several management methods such as six-Sigma and Kaizen. 
In this article we will study the case of the decline in activity in large-scale distribution, knowing that during 
periods of confinement, sales of hypermarkets recorded a strong regression in Morocco, Since the Ratio of 
all the indicators of management and all expenses of a hypermarket is always linked to sales excluding 
taxes, this is why they were led to optimize their expenses and review their management method to alleviate 
the loss. 
In this article, we will see the reasons for the decline in activity and the action plans to be taken to optimize 
the expenses of hypermarkets using the LSS (lean six sigma) method.

 Final Stock Value: the inventory of consumable products is made at the end of the month to calculate 
the value of final stock and deduce the value of consumption by department 
 The success of this project required the involvement of all staff, training and awareness of the 
importance of optimizing consumable costs was also carried out. 
 
Control: Measure again and monitor 
 
After the application of this process in November and December, the consumable load dropped remarkably, firstly 
because the staff became aware of the problem and were involved in awareness raising and training, secondly we were 
able to detect the department that consumes the most consumable products and the most consumed product during the 
month. 
Table (1) shows the consumption of the consumable used during one month by each department by involving all teams 
from the placing of orders to the reliability of the monthly inventory, and after the installation of consumables in 
premises specific to each department. 
 
 
 
 
6. Conclusion  
This article presented a method of optimizing consumption of hypermarket consumable using Lean Six-Sigma (LSS) 
project management applied in a Moroccan retail company. The proposed Lean six-sigma approach is KAIZEN. Since 
there are not many supermarket chains in Morocco, there is a lack of knowledge or application of lean management 
and six-sigma applied to hypermarkets. The first thing was to be able to present these methodologies and show their 
benefits for all company management and finally to agree to them to help optimize one component of the costs and 
why not all the other components. Through this approach, the results of the study showed that improved process and 
project management and the involvement of the whole team can be achieved by continuously identifying, analyzing 
and seeing opportunities for improving processes and decisions while optimizing resources and eliminating waste.

ABSTRACT 
This research aims to study the issues derived from the current trade finance processes, followed by evaluating the 
available technological solutions proposed by researchers and FinTechs. The purpose of seeking technological 
solutions is to replace the current obsolete processes of traditional trade finance, which rely heavily on manual 
monotonous labor and paperwork. In this research, the impact of blockchain technology on the Trade Finance 
processes is examined using three simulation models, Paper Letter of Credit, Bank Payment Obligation (BPO), and 
Blockchain Letter of Credit. The research findings observed a significant increase in process efficiency up to 94% 
while conducting processes under Blockchain Platform and 74% using BPO. 
Moreover, the study demonstrates how the efficiency gained from applying blockchain technology to the trade finance 
processes could increase productivity and significantly reduce processing costs. The research findings provided an 
essential awareness to banks, corporates, and governmental authorities about the importance of blockchain technology 
in trade finance and highlighted the need for an urgent digital transformation. Researchers can extend studies by 
applying proof of concept of Blockchain implementation to other trade finance processes such as Documentary 
Collections and Guarantees. Future work can include more parties from the entire trade ecosystem such as Shippers, 
Insurers, and Governmental authorities.

1. Introduction 
As the World undergoes a considerable paradigm shift and it is for definite applying a recent technology towards 
digitalization and automation of any of the trade finance processes will significantly enhance efficiency for all 
stakeholders, banks, corporates, government entities, and other parties involved in trade finance processes. Moreover, 
COVID-19 accelerated the urge for digitization and digitalization in ways that were unimaginable before to COVID-
19. Trade finance processes depend almost entirely on physical paper documentation to process payments and clear 
the underlying of goods to buyers. COVID-19 pandemic which has caused a painful impact on the trade processes and 
created historical Trade Finance market disruptions. In most countries, government authorities reduced the number of 
employees present in the office and increased the number of employees to work remotely from their homes. Also,

Decentralization in terms of contract implementation: Real time change status features in 
blockchain eliminate the lengthy manual process to monitor the delivery of goods. While in BPO, the buyer 
will manually track the goods with the shipper. 
• 
Proof of ownership: Because of blockchain unique attributes, electronic documents of title such as 
electronic bill of lading (E-bill) will be automatically assigned to the buyer once payment or undertaking of 
payment is executed in the blockchain platform. In contrast, within BPO, the buyer will require the seller to 
dispatch the original physical documents of title, such as bill of ladings, to have ownership over the good. 
8. Conclusion 
Many banks worldwide have considered that the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) is a serious risk of interrupting its 
business and raised concerns on the long-term inability of physical document delivery and circulation between all 
parties in the trade. This study explored how blockchain technology can essentially impact trade finance processes. 
The blockchain can improve trade business processes, eliminate paper manipulation, increase process efficiency, and 
provide a real opportunity to all parties involved in the trade process to reduce costs and increase productivity. The 
impact of blockchain technology on the trade finance processes was examined by testing and simulating 1,200,000 
L/C processes in both cases, the current paper-based process and blockchain process, and 600,000 BPOs as an 
additional alternative digital solution. We used Simulation Software, AnyLogic, to examine and test the effect of 
blockchain technology on trade finance processes using three simulation models, letter of credit paper-based process, 
blockchain-based process, and bank payment obligation (BPO). The research findings observed a significant increase 
in process efficiency up to 94% while conducting L/Cs under the blockchain platform and 74% while shifting to digital 
process using BPO. In addition, the study demonstrated how the efficiency gained by applying blockchain technology 
to the trade finance process increases productivity and reduces labor and courier costs. The automatic notification of 
status changes can be an added value function enabled by blockchain platforms creating end-to-end traceability 
features to trade finance processes.        
 
This study is a supporting tool that enables experts make their important and strategic decision of the miraculous 
proven effect of blockchain technology to trade ecosystems and supply chains. It presents near-real proof of concept 
by Simulative illustration. As such, our study should assist banks, corporates, and government authorities in making 
decisions about implementation. Standardization of this technology as the first milestone will give full support for 
blockchain-enabled initiatives toward an umbrella use of this technology to cover all banks and trade parties 
worldwide.  
 
Even though this study is unique, it also has limitations. The research is limited to the specific effect of blockchain 
technology on supply chain and trade finance in respect of processing time efficiency implementation and costs. Other 
costs involved in trade finance processes such as papers, administrative, emission, technology were not considered in 
this study. In the future, researchers may focus on the implementation of blockchain technology in trade finance 
processes considering other costs. More studies have to be conducted to explore and include more stakeholders in the 
process or cover broader forms to include more parties involved in the entire trade ecosystem.

Abstract 
 
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) and its fabrication process has recently attracted much attention because of their 
potential application as soft active materials. In this work, a dimension accuracy approach using artificial neural 
networks (ANN) is presented for overcoming the dimensional challenge in shape memory polymer/graphene oxide 
(SMP/GO) composites using projection-type Stereolithography (SL) 3D printing. Experimental trials were conducted 
to achieve proper SMP photo-resin mixing (monomer, cross-linker, photo-initiator) and suitable GO dispersion in 
SMP/GO composite. An artificial neural network (ANN) was designed based on back propagation theory for 
modelling dimensional error on specimens. ANN training and testing phases used Stereolithography (SL) historical 
data and results were compared using two different ANN architecture.  Using the ANN approach, this paper reports a 
maximum Pearson correlation of 77.7 % during testing. It could be used as a reference for fabrication, and dimensional 
error modelling of SMP/GO composites fabricated via SL 3D printing technique.

1. Introduction 
3D printing technique has been demonstrated to be an innovative manufacturing method for industrial, medical, 
automotive and aerospace sectors (Santo et al. 2014). 3D printing technique with a high finishing resolution and fast 
curing speed is stereolithography (SL). This process is divided in two main classes of processes: scanning type (SLA) 
process, and projection type process. The former uses a UV laser beam to cure sections of photo-resin in a layer-by-
layer fashion up to the completion of the part. The projection type uses a digital light projector (DLP) to cure resin by 
projecting the cross section of sliced layers of the CAD file up to the completion of the part (Choong et al. 2017a, 
Choong et al. 2017b, Choong et al. 2016). Recently 3D printing concept has evolved into 4D printing by incorporating 
smart materials (Marquez and Bolborici 2017, Marquez 2016, Renteria-Marquez, Renteria-Marquez and T. L. Tseng 
, Chavez et al.) in 3D printing technologies (Tibbits 2014). A strategy to promote the utilization of 4D printing in 
design and manufacturing stages is to increase the list of materials available. This increment of material availability 
implies adapting new polymer composites to commercial or customized 3D printers (Monkman 2000, Kim et al.

Abstract 
 
Digital divide centers on access to various dimensions of information and communication 
technology (ICT) including physical access, motivation, skills, and actual usage of digital technologies. 
This divide tends to be even wider in the context of developing countries. Further, educational setting has 
been recognized as a domain with good potential for incorporation of new technologies. It involves a wide 
range of users of learning technology which should support the process of knowledge transfer and 
acquisition. Yet, there is a lack of literature on the digital divide and technology acceptance among the 
students and teachers in secondary education. As an initial step to fill the gap in the existing literature, 
developing a new model to capture the interplay between digital divide and technology acceptance, and 
how these affect performances among students and teachers using structural equation modelling and 
confirmatory factor analysis is of essence. This paper focuses on the development and validation of such a 
model. The purpose of the study is to build a model that examines relationships among variables associated 
with factors that influence technology acceptance and digital divide. Data was collected from 1000 
participants using a survey questionnaire. Employing structural equation modelling, a hypothesized model 
was tested for model fit in the study. The resulting model is found to have a good fit.

1. Introduction 
 
Information and communication technologies have become pervasive in the society having positive 
consequences on every walk of people’s life including education. Researchers have also recognized the 
significance of technology in education particularly to enhance teaching-learning processes (Ertmer, Ottenbreit-
Leftwich, Sadik, Sendurur & Sendurur, 2012; Youssef et al., 2013). These technologies can be very helpful to 
elevate the standards and quality of various dimensions of teaching-learning processes including content 
delivery, peer-learning, complementing the curriculum, and student assessment. Further, the significance of 
Learning management systems s is more vivid in institutions of basic education due to their acknowledged role 
in building the foundations for the next generation of professionals in a knowledge society. 
Technology is ubiquitous in all areas in society. In education, at least two trends can be observed: First, 
educational systems are incorporating digital competences in curricula and assessments (Flórez et al., 2017).

Abstract  
 
Nowadays, the rapidly changing of manufacturing environment has pushed companies to achieve more customer 
satisfaction by enhancing product quality, reducing production cost, and realizing sustainability. Anomaly detection 
has a strong influence on the quality of products and it is usually conducted through visual quality inspection. The 
visual quality inspection of a product can be performed either manually or automatically. The manual inspection 
suffers from being a monotonous task, leading to overlooked errors and subjective assessments. Accordingly, the 
manufacturing industry has high ambitions to rely upon automated quality inspection systems to cope with the 
requirements of smart manufacturing and the emergence of industry 4.0. Efficient utilization of big data can enable 
the development of intelligent quality inspection systems. Machine learning as one of the prevailing data analytics 
methods is widely used to support and improve the performance of the automated quality inspection systems. This 
research compares the performance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) like Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with the 
traditional machine learning algorithms (TMLA) for anomalies detection in manufacturing such as Decision Trees, 
Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and Logistic 
Regression (LR). A data set for faults is adapted from the literature to fairly compare the performance of these 
algorithms considering different accuracy measures such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score.

1. Introduction  
One of the most vital day-to-day practices in industry is anomaly detection. There are two major types of anomaly 
detection, manually and automatically inspection. Basically, manual inspection is a repetitive task that easily leads to 
missed mistakes and self-assessments. This is particularly challenging in cases where defects occur infrequently. 
Furthermore, since manual marking of defects is extremely time-consuming, anomaly detection in manufacturing 
systems has gained popularity among researchers and industry staff. This has motivated the researchers to develop

This paper presented a comparative study of different machine learning algorithms, for anomalies detection in 
manufacturing using the dataset of Steel plate faults, by Semeion, Research of Sciences of Communication. A 
framework has been developed for the multi classification of steel plates faults from fault (1-7) by investigation the 
use of mostly popular traditional machine learning; Decision trees, KNN, SVM, Naïve Bayes, RF, Logistic Regression 
and artificial neural network namely multilayer perceptron (MLP). The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score 
are considered the key performance metrics for the comparative study. It has been observed that some ML Algorithms 
had an accuracy above 93% in detecting faults. The RF has the best recall, accuracy, precision and F1 score 
performance average measures over the competitors. By comparing TMLA with MLP as one of the ANN, TMLA are 
superior to MLP. From the results, the faults can be classified into three categories; (i) easily classified faults like fault 
4, (ii) faults cannot be easily classified like fault 7, (iii) faults detection performance depends on the type of ML 
algorithms. Therefore, it is recommended that, to find the suitable ML algorithm to classify those faults. The 
performance of the methods achieved of test data is reached 93% that guide production managers can utilize the ML 
to automate and improve fault detection instead of monotonous manual inspection. In addition, the significant and 
rapid improvements in data integration technologies make ML a powerful tool in manufacturing processes and can be 
utilized to gain beneficial insights into the behavior of manufacturing systems, improving the quality of decisions. 
Future research should consider testing the adopted machine learning algorithm in this paper with a variety of 
applications in manufacturing. In addition, other machine learning algorithms or hybrid algorithms should be 
developed and tested for improving the detecting accuracy. In particular, there is a need to find some appropriate 
machine learning algorithms to handle the cases such as faults 6 and 7.

Abstract 
 
Firm’s performance can not be limited to minimizing costs and increased production volumes. It now requires a 
continuous improvement approach, overall, resulting in deployment of all economic, environmental and social 
dimensions of enterprise: so this is a so-called overall performance to be considered. Financial performance is no 
longer sufficient to assess firm’s performance. Therefore, companies should measure their progress from a more 
comprehensive performance including, apart from economic dimension, environmental and social dimensions. 
Goal of this work is to design a module for obtaining a global composite index in order to determine integrated 
information on economic, environmental, social and global performance of firm in time. Normalized indicators 
were associated into three sustainability sub-indices and finally composed into a global indicator of firm’s global 
performance. A case study was used to validate this module, interpretation of results is given and the utility of our 
module with its relevance is pointed out.

I. 
Introduction 
Global performance, defined as ""the aggregate of economic, social and environmental performance"" 
(Baret 2006), is a multidimensional concept difficult to measure technically. Indeed, evaluation systems currently 
used by companies to measure progress through their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives do not 
provide satisfactory answers. Not being able to assess progress prevents companies to know where to focus their 
improvement efforts. Today, the challenge for companies is to measure interactions between different 
performance dimensions: economic, social and environmental. This paper raises question of the existence of a 
global performance measurement. To answer this question, we will analyze the current performance evaluation 
tools used by proactive companies in the field of social responsibility by highlighting the obstacles which prevent 
overall measure of performance. But before turning to the question of measurement, it is important to understand 
global performance concept. 
Old mechanisms of performance measurement, such as costs, do not give firms a clear view on 
consequences of their management practices. Approaches currently available are mainly focused on 
environmental sphere, when firm’s management practices are more complex, integrating the three dimensions of 
sustainable development (economic, environmental and social). It's true that public institutions encourage firms 
to make sustainable development a strategic issue. In firm, sustainable development is a transversal concept which 
affects all stakeholders who have different and sometimes conflicting goals. Performance is complex to master 
given different processes to consider, various stakeholders to integrate and various dimensions in which stakes 
are declined. To take into account all firms impacts, it is essential to develop a comprehensive performance 
evaluation methods. These latters must be consistent with specificities of each stakeholder. Now, difficulty in 
firms is to measure interactions between the three dimensions of global performance.  
 
II. Sustainable Development Concept 
Sustainable development is talked about that for twenty years, and yet it goes back much further. Since 
oil shock of 1973 and the first environmental disasters, scientists are aware of the danger that mankind poses to 
planet and for its own survival. 
Sustainable development concept was born of the will of the World Commission on Environment and 
Development (WCED) to propose a path of reconciliation between economic development and ecological 
balances. This is the Brundtland report, which proposes the definition currently used for sustainable development. 
Forty years: history is still short. But forty years is enough to bring hundreds of heads of state. Since 1972, the 
ideas cheminent, the first reports are published and international conferences on the environment are increasing. 
In forty years, international community has promised much but has only partially implemented.

1623","included in a more targeted context, such as reflecting firm status regarding sustainability, providing information 
to critical decision processes, or possibly forming basis for firm to head in a certain direction. This evaluation 
module helps to highlight improvement opportunities and where best practices might be found. It provides early 
warning information and tracks sustainability of firm. 
Decision-makers could easily interpret (Ig) and its corresponding sub-indices than trying to find a trend 
in many separate criteria of sustainable development. If included in annual sustainability report, we could use this 
module to present firm progress in terms of sustainability to the various interested parties in firm sustainability. 
Also, this evaluation module if would be applied to different firms, it would be possible to compare and rank them 
in terms of sustainability. 
Based on our evaluation module of global performance we can decide if we apply or not a given best 
practice in firm following its sustainable performance calculated by (IEco, IEnv, ISoc and Ig). 
By this module, we provide to decision maker a tool which allows him: 
1. To analyze current and potential value of activities implemented and to consider actions to strengthen this 
value such as implementation of sustainable best practices. This analysis allows him to define activities scope 
and to consider several options for this end, as part of differentiation strategy by CSR. 
2. To analyze global performance profile related to firm decisions during planning phase, choose firm’s 
configuration and the way to exploit it in advanced and optimized manner in order to ensure target level of 
global performance. This later defines the strategy or CSR policy which decision maker wishes to implement. 
3. To know precisely additional investment in terms monetary, which he must engage to achieve the level of 
desired global performance. 
4. To have quantitative performance indicator which used to control firm and for purposes of communication. 
 
VII. Conclusion 
measuring global performance, vague concept, is related to many difficulties and presented by many 
authors as the aggregation of the economic, social and environmental performances of firm. Analysis of different 
measurement tools used by companies to understand their performance, shows that no one is able to measure 
interactions between different segments of performance. For the moment, available tools (Balanced ScoreCard in 
its updated version of CSR, Triple Bottom Line reporting) provide a segmented view of global performance in 
three dimensions: economic, social and environmental. They measure these dimensions separately and then 
compile them regardless of correlations between these dimensions. In the best case, some tools (crusaders GRI 
indicators) evaluate interactions between two dimensions: economic / social or economic / environmental, but, 
they do not allow to significantly integrate the three dimensions of global performance. However, it should be 
recalled, as financial performance and choice of these indicators is a political arbitration. They must be built in a 
concertatif and strategic process with leaders agreement and participation of company stakeholders. In this 
perspective, global performance can be analyzed as a social convention co-constructed and negotiated between 
company's management and its various stakeholders. 
While sustainability information is typically treated separately, this paper tries to translate it into a form 
which corresponds to needs of decision-makers. This work illustrates that it is possible to assess sustainable 
development in an integrated way which provides good guidance for decision-making. As the business case for 
sustainable practices becomes increasingly clear, sustainability reporting offers a measurable value to those whose 
business is to assess current sustainability health of firms and influence future actions. At present, content of 
sustainability reports tends to appear in forms and units that are not readily convertible into unique terms. The 
module presented in this article promises advance in sustainability assessment of firm and makes sustainability 
information more useful to decision-makers. Core and supplemental indicators (IEco, IEnv, ISoc) when combined 
into global composite index (Ig) can be used to reflect the achievements of firm towards sustainability. 
Even though further development is called for, it is evident that this module for sustainable development 
assessment has the potential to become very useful as one of available tools. The combination of better assessment 
methods is likely to continue this movement towards a new generation of integrated sustainability performance 
reports.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents a literature review regarding the supply chain risks. The principle intention is to distinguish 
and characterize the risks compromising the Supply Chain. The operations complexity makes managing the supply 
chain risks a significant challenge; and any complexity prompts risks and vulnerabilities. The literature review of 
160 publications permitted us to accumulate a few risks that are assembled into operational and disruption risks, 
ordered appropriately to their appearance in the publications, which allowed us to focus on the risks, and perceive 
their consequences on the smooth running of the supply chain. At last, it is necessary to be aware and 
knowledgeable about these risks in order to take them into consideration, so as to work on mitigation actions and 
alleviate any damage to the supply chain performance.

1. Introduction  
During these last decades, logistics researchers and practitioners are always looking for new opportunities of 
improvement of the supply chain (SC) performance. This is explained by the numerous researches on this subject, 
they try to identify the risks threatening the good functioning of the SC operations, using different tools that would 
allow them to differentiate between the aberrant risks in order to define, prioritize, analyze and finally manage 
them. La Londe and Masters (1994) proposed that a supply chain is a set of firms that pass materials forward. 
Normally, several independent firms are involved in product manufacturing and placing it in the hands of the end-
user in a supply chain—raw material and component producers, product assemblers, wholesalers, retailer 
merchants, and transportation companies are all members of a supply chain. In the same way, Lambert et al. 
(1998) define a supply chain as the alignment of firms that brings products or services to market. These concepts 
of the supply chain include the final consumer as part of the supply chain. Christopher (1992) define the supply 
chain differently: “supply chain is the network of organizations that are involved, through upstream and 
downstream linkages, in the different processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and 
services delivered to the ultimate consumer”. Mentzer et al. (2001) summarize all the definitions listed above as 
“supply chain is defined as a set of three or more entities (organizations or individuals) directly involved in the 
upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, and/or information from a source to a customer”.

Abstract 
 
Research in maintenance engineering is increasingly focusing on complex systems in which components are subject 
to various dependencies, such as stochastic, structural, and economic dependences. This paper proposes a 
mathematical approach to calculate system’s availability with stochastic dependence and assesses its effect on the 
system. From this perspective, Cox Proportional Hazards Model (CPHM), based on the exponential survival 
distribution, is used. The results show that increasing the degree of dependence impacts, considerably, system 
availability.

1644","For instance, it can be also noticed in the figure 5 that show the impact of 𝛽𝛽 on 𝜆𝜆𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 for different value of 𝜆𝜆. We 
remark in this figure that the stochastic dependence has more impact on the system with high failure rate and makes 
of which the probability of failure more important. Therefore, this note completes the information contained in the 
figure 3. From the figures 3 and 4 we can conclude that the degree of dependence 𝛽𝛽 is defined in the interval [0; 10].   
 
Based on the previous analysis, we highlight the following observations: (i) The availability of system is impacted 
significantly by the stochastic dependence. This impact quantified by the CPHM; (ii) increasing the degree of 
dependence 𝛽𝛽 considerably influences the availability of the entire system and consequently the availability of 𝐶𝐶1 ; 
(iii) Intrinsically, this effect modifies the 𝜆𝜆 parameter of the exponential distribution meaning it increases with the 
degree of dependence; and (iv) the stochastic dependence has more impact on components that have a high probability 
of failure. 
6. Conclusion  
In this paper, we have proposed a mathematical approach of availability calculation for a parallel two-machine system 
with considering the stochastic dependence. The exposed procedure to evaluate the dependence's effect is based on 
the consideration of two functions. The first function, called the influence function, which defines the factors 
influencing availability 'dependency factor'. The second one, called basic time function. Thus, this approach makes it 
possible to evaluate the failure rate impact of one machine's failure rate on that of another with the time-dependent 
basic function (exponential distribution). Therefore, it makes possible to assess the impact of the failure rate of one 
machine on that of another. In this case, it shows the dependency's impact on the availability and repair rates of a 
machine stochastically dependent on another. Consequently, it is more realistic to consider these interactions when 
optimizing maintenance, production, or integrated optimization of these two functions. Hence, it is recommended to 
use such an approach as a starting point, to obtain a better assessment and estimation of the system availability, as 
well as a better planning of maintenance and production because in case of an incorrect estimation, a surplus of various 
unnecessary costs can be generated.

Abstract 
 
 The application of electronic government has many obstacles, both from the end user and other stakeholders, 
even though the e-government system aims to create a process that facilitates the process of providing services to 
citizens. Several factors that cause users to reject the use of electronic government are related to the use of technology 
adopted by e-government and the benefits of technology that support e-government. By analyzing the causes of 
rejection of e-government, this study aims to provide a solution to the problem of using e-government with a 
technology acceptance model (TAM) approach. The research method used a qualitative approach by conducting 
observations and interviews with e-government users and literature studies related to solutions to the problems of 
implementing e-government. The result of this study is an extension of the TAM for e-government.

1. Introduction  
E-Government is the utilize of innovation to upgrade the get to and conveyance of government 
administrations to advantage citizens, trade accomplices and workers. It has the control to make an unused mode of 
open benefit where all open organizations convey a modernized, coordinates and consistent benefit for their citizens. 
The relationship is now not fair a one-way ‘us-versus-them’ recommendation; or maybe, it is approximately building 
an association between governments and citizens.  
Indeed in spite of the fact that most of the fervor centers upon the Web, governments must be mindful that 
e-Government influences each viewpoint of how an organization conveys benefit to the open. It isn't just technology; 
it isn't fair trade forms; it isn't fair human assets. It is all these zones combined. At the center of it all is the client.  
Large investment of funds and resources to build e-government should result in maximum government 
performance. However, from several observations made, there are still many e-government developments that are not 
functioning as expected. There are several factors that hinder the employment of electronic government as follows: 
organizational constraints, human resource constraints and infrastructure constraints. This research goals to identify 
the obstacles that hinder electronic government and provide solutions using a technology acceptance model. The 
output of this study is the application of a TAM to increase the usage of electronic government.

5. Conclusion 
The model generated from this research can help the government solve several problems related to the 
implementation of e-government both in terms of regulation, budget and more importantly, the use of an approach 
with a technology acceptance model that will maximize the use of e-government by all stakeholders

Abstract  
 
The government has a big responsibility to provide maximum service to citizens or the society and the 
effectiveness of internal processes in government such as coordination and collaboration between ministries 
and externals such as services to society. On the other hand, technological developments, especially cloud 
computing, can be alternative solutions so that information systems can be more efficient and effective. 
The purpose of this research is to build a comprehensive e-government model that covers all parts of the 
government using cloud base technology. The result of this research is an integrated electronic government 
model based with cloud technology.

1. Introduction  
E-government is built with the aim of providing maximum service to society, both individuals and institutions, as 
the state's responsibility to serve its people and  e-government also increases the effectiveness and efficiency of 
internal government processes such as communication, coordination, collaboration and several management 
functions among ministries, divisions or divisions in government. 
Some parts of the government have used information technology-based systems to support departmental 
performance including improving services to the public . For  example, tax payments can be made online, immigration 
permits for people who want to go abroad have also been done online and in several parts others are already doing 
the same. However, between one department or part and another is not integrated, making it difficult to coordinate 
and collaborate. 
On the other hand, cloud computing technology has been widely used by companies because it provides many 
benefits for this background and the potential use of cloud computing technology, so this research aims to help the 
government improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services to society and internal government processes by 
using e-government. The final result of this research is a cloud computing-based e-government model for its user.

The e-government model that integrates all parts of government is an effective solution to creating good governance because 
of the effectiveness and efficiency created to support internal processes in government and services to citizens. The model built 
using cloud computing technology will add to some of the benefits of e-government as well as the benefits of cloud 
computing

Abstract  
 
The study examined the effect of working capital management on the profitability of PT. Padumacom Karya 
Jaya as the company has a problem with its decreasing profit, whereas the company has increasing revenue. 
This study analyzes the debt ratio, average collection period, average payment period, and current ratio as 
the independent variables and return on assets as the dependent variable. The data was obtained from the 
monthly financial report of the company for three years. Classical assumption, descriptive statistics, 
correlation, and multiple regression analysis are used as the methods to analyze the data used for this study. 
The findings of this study show that there is significant influence of debt ratio, average collection period, 
and average payment period on the return on assets, whereas there is no significant influence of current 
ratio on the return on assets. The three variables have negative impact that can be seen through the 
regression coefficients of 0.003, 0.042, and 0.0155, respectively. Every increase in each variable will 
decrease profitability and vice versa. The most significance variable is the average payment period, so the 
company must be concerned about the period to pay its debt, because when the company is late, the creditor 
will charge interest to the company and also the company might face the currency inflation when it times 
to pay the debt because company uses other currency to do the transactions.

1. Introduction 
In the development of globalization and the world’s economy, every company always works hard to always be in the 
competition with other companies. Therefore, no company wants to lose the battle or competition or even worse to 
fail in performing the business. In this era, every business will always develop as the environment is changing due to 
the effect of globalization. With the continuous change, it is easy for a new business or company to enter the market 
and compete with the existing companies. Those newcomer makes the competition more difficult and fiercely. In this 
case, the existing company must always be ready to defend and compete against other existing companies or the new 
companies in the future. Thus, in order to always last in the competition, each company is required to always be 
innovative in facing the changes and competition in the market. Being innovative is not enough, each company is

The regression coefficient of -0.042 (ACP) implies the opposite relationship betweem accounts receivable 
period and profitability. Therefore, if the accounts recervable period reduces, profitability will be increased 
as much as 0.042%. 
– 
The regression coefficient of -0.155 (APP) implies the opposite relationship between accounts payable period 
and profitability. Therefore, if the accounts payable period reduced, profitability will be increased as much 
as 0.155%. 
– 
The regression coefficient of 2.192 (CR) implies when every additional 1% can result to an increase in 
profitability. Therefore, it indicates that every additional 1% will increase Return on Assets as much as 
0.2192%.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the result of the test, it can be concluded that:  
1. There is significant influence of debt ratio on profitability of PT. Padumacom Karya Jaya. 
2. There is significant influence of average collection period on profitability of PT. Padumacom Karya Jaya.  
3. There is significant influence of average payment period on profitability of PT. Padumacom Karya Jaya.  
4. There is no significant influence of current ratio on profitabiliy of PT. Padumacom Karya Jaya. 
 
It is proven that debt ratio, average collection period and account payable period have significant negative effect on 
profitability with regression coefficients of 0.003, 0.042, and 0.0155, respectively. Every increase in each variable 
will decrease profitability and vice versa. Therefore, to improve further profitability the company must be concerned 
about the period to pay its debt. Because if the company is late, the company will be charged the interest from its 
creditor and the currency inflation can decrease the profitability of the company. In conclusion, it is important for the 
company to minimize its debt, use other current assets when purchasing the equipment, obtain more capital or assets 
so the company can purchase in cash, and has to be wiser in collecting its account receivable. As a result, working 
capital has to be managed in order to increase the profitability and create more value for the shareholders and 
employees. It is also recommended that the company has to separately focus on each component of the working capital 
on the company. This study is limited to the three years period of time, therefore other researcher can use a longer 
period and this study is limited to four independent variables, therefore other researcher can use other or more 
variables.

Abstract 
 
The stator and rotor pole structure and power inverters have significant influence on electromagnetic torque 
performances and efficiency performances. Many papers have investigated on those design parameters on motor result 
[1][2][3] [4].  Inductance and flux linkage will be influenced by rotor and stator pole combination and magnetic circuit.  
In this paper, The SRM 12/10 and 8/6 will be modified from 12/8 with the same outer diameter stator and stack length. 
The paper figures out some stator and rotor pole arc to get maximum average torque and torque ripple reduction. For 
commercial switched reluctance motor, control method is single voltage or current pulse in higher speed not chopping 
current. The DC link voltage of power converter of SRM is limited, it is difficult to achieve constant torque in wider 
range of speed because the magnetic circuit is saturated condition, and the phase current cannot rise reference value. 
To improving average torque at high speed, increasing voltage or rotor poles or winding phases are possible for E-
bike application.

Abstract  
Application Programming Interface (API) has been largely used in most of the technology platforms available in the 
market nowadays. It has become vital for a business to utilize the capabilities of an API in integrating various systems 
they have in place. In this study, the researchers propose an automatic integration of two widely used systems in the 
Facility Management industry, the Computer-aided FM and ERP software using API. The development of the new 
system model has been analyzed using various systems analysis tools such Root cause Analysis,  and Swimlane 
Workflow Diagrams. The project has proven to be highly beneficial for the company because can offer reduction in 
IT expenses, reduction in time required to complete tasks within the system and can deliver better data integrity and 
reliability.

1. Introduction 
SBD Company is currently implementing a software system called FSI Concept Evolution, which is a Computer-
Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) tool to aid in management of all facilities maintenance activities.  To facilitate 
the procurement and finance side of the business, SBD uses a different software, which is an Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) software, called Microsoft Dynamics 365. Aiming to track and record all company processes and 
transactions, and the goal to be a fully digitized company, SBD has been using both software to manage mentioned 
aspects of the company. With the aim to capture full data from both systems, a manual integration was implemented 
to record the same details in both systems. Because of this, each of the individual software has generated its own 
separate expenses and has generated its own individual person-hours for one task, causing redundancies in effort and 
cost. Furthermore, redundant entries paved way for redundant mistakes in data entries. 
With the aim to resolve the mentioned issues, numerous management meetings and discussions were conducted 
between IT, operations, and senior management. As a result, an IT implementation using Application Programming 
Interface (API), a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other, was approved for 
implementation to automatically integrate CAFM and ERP related to PR/PO Cycle and Invoicing and Payment Cycle. 
The API to be used is an FSI web service which is capable to talk to the ERP system given the correct security token 
to trigger and enable data transfer from FSI to Microsoft Dynamic 365 and vice versa. 
The project’s goal is to save time and effort in managing the full cycle of facilities maintenance processes starting 
from the request for a particular job, procurement of resources, completion of the job, invoicing until payment of the 
job completed. The automatic integration will provide a smooth process flow and will integrate all functions from 
operations, procurement up to finance.

5. Conclusion 
Based on the summary of the evaluation of the advantages of the new proposed system, it is revealed that the use of 
API in system integration automation can offer a significant improvement in the system. It will support the company’s 
goal of integrated data without the   causing the company to spend more than necessary.   The new automated system 
also revealed to be most beneficial to the company because it can allow   streamlined process with lesser man-hours 
required for a full process completion. Another important advantage is the automatic integration can produce more 
reliable data with less errors due to encoding mistakes. Overall, it can be concluded that the new proposed system can 
be very effective and is a very good system to implement.

Abstract 
Enterprise Resource Planning software is a very essential tool for enterprises in the digital age. The study was 
conducted for Model Auto & Equipment Supplies Inc., which supplies and deals with all kinds and types of automotive 
parts, whose purchasing processes are lacking in terms of automation and report generation. The researchers designed 
and simulated a future state of the purchasing processes that can generally improve the purchasing process with the 
help of an ERP system. The results showed that the future state of the processes can automatically generate significant 
reports by the ERP Software enabling MODEL to monitor and evaluate themselves and their suppliers, this feature of 
the ERP software will eliminate repetitive tasks. The Purchasing Item/Materials process’s VS ratio risen by 37.738%, 
from 57.500% to 95.238%, and the Request for Quotation (RFQ) Document Creation process the VS ratio is expected 
to rise by 8.967%, from 34.783% to 43.750%. Lead time for Purchasing Item/Materials process was reduced by 19 
minutes while 7 minutes was reduced from the Request for Quotation (RFQ) Document Creation process. The physical 
storage will be replaced by a cloud storage that will eliminate the issues that the current physical storage of MODEL 
is facing.

I. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background of the Study 
Model Auto Supply and Equipment is a company that sells automotive parts and equipment. The company operates manually 
within terms of recording purchase information and transactions with their suppliers, bank deposits and withdrawals, check/cheque 
issuance, as well as paying off bills and purchases. The issue that the purchasing department faces would be the old methods of 
the company which also led to their lack of automation and System Integration on their processes. The company’s purchasing 
department still records files manually for processes such as the purchasing of materials and requesting for quotation, they record 
them manually in a columnar book and excel for the submission to their accountant which is usually late resulting in penalties 
when submitting late reports to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and redundancy of tasks. The old filing cabinets of Model led to 
poor organization of files. Making the process of looking for appropriate files difficult. The company is also lacking when it comes 
to Report generation not just on the purchase records but also other forms of reports about the purchasing process such as 
Purchase Order records by each supplier that might be useful for evaluating suppliers and monitoring the purchasing habits of 
the company itself. MODEL Auto Supply and Equipment must implement an Enterprise Resource Planning Software in order for 
them to access a wide variety of reports and avoid the nuisance of repetitive tasks such as recording the purchases on a book and 
on excel both with poor filing systems. SAP s/4HANA, an ERP Software is a suitable platform to be integrated and implemented 
on the company’s operation since it provides resiliency during uncertainty, by utilizing this software it would provide up-to-date 
deliverables and reports that would help the company’s decision-making. Its features include Streamlined reporting eliminates data

1706","By comparing the current state (figure 22) and the future state (figure 23) the proposed future process flow for the Purchasing 
Item/Materials process the VS ratio is expected to rise by 37.738%, from 57.500% to 95.238%. Reduce lead time by 19 minutes 
and remove the distance traveled. These positive results are possible due to the removal of the non-value adding steps namely, 
“Sales Staff receives RFQ”, “Sales staff print RFQ”, and “Sales staff send RFQ” which has a total of 8 minutes as these processes 
will not be necessary once the ERP solution is implemented, MODEL could set the purchasing department responsibility to 
immediately receive and respond to RFQs coming from customers. Together with the optimization of other steps when integrated 
with an ERP Software. 
 
Request For Quotation (RFQ) Document Creation Process 
Figure 24. Current State 
 
Figure 25. Future State 
By comparing the current state (figure 24) and the future state (figure 25) the proposed future process flow for the Request For 
Quotation (RFQ) Document Creation process the VS ratio is expected to rise by 8.967%, from 34.783% to 43.750%. Reduce lead 
time by 7 minutes and remove distance traveled as well. These positive results are possible due to the removal of the 5-minute non- 
value-adding step namely, “Purchasing Staff Looks for the Previous RFQ Document” as these processes will not be necessary once 
the ERP solution is implemented, and MODEL would be able to record their supplier’s information together with the materials 
information as well making it easier and efficient to create a Request for Quotation document. 
 
Virtual/Cloud Storage 
Physical file storage is what MODEL is currently utilizing which occupies a lot of physical space in their office as they have been 
using this type of storage for more than 40 years and misplaced files and getting damaged by floods is not a new experience to the 
company. This type of storage also makes it hard for them when it comes to looking for a specific document. Unlike physical 
storage, the Virtual or Cloud storage that will be implemented together with the ERP software has a search function and does not 
take up physical space and is also protected against force majeure or natural events that are a threat to physical storages and 
documents. 
 
Purchasing Reports 
MODEL Auto and Equipment Supplies currently utilizes only 1 purchasing report which is the record of all of their purchases. On 
the other hand, the future state of the purchasing processes with ERP software implementation generates various reports which 
significance for MODEL has been discussed for each. These would enable MODEL to eliminate repetitive tasks such as recording 
on columnar books as they can now just record the purchases’ data in the software and generate the report or print it out if a physical 
copy is needed. These reports would not just improve the purchasing department but the whole decision-making of the company 
as well. 
 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this case study, it was evident that through the implementation of an ERP Software Solution, the purchasing processes of MODEL 
AUTO AND EQUIPMENT SUPPLIES can be improved. Proven by the automatic generation of various significant reports by the 
ERP Software that enables MODEL to monitor their purchasing habits and evaluate their suppliers as well as an additional insight 
for decision making. This feature of the ERP software will eliminate repetitive tasks, MODEL can now record all of the purchases 
in the system and generate or print out a report when a physical copy is needed. Together with the simulation outcomes presented 
by the flow process charts. The Purchasing Item/Materials process’s VS ratio rose by 37.738%, from 57.500% to 95.238%, and in 
the Request for Quotation (RFQ) Document Creation process the VS ratio is expected to rise by 8.967%, from 34.783% to 43.750%. 
Lead time for Purchasing Item/Materials process was reduced by 19 minutes while 7 minutes was reduced from the Request for 
Quotation (RFQ) Document Creation process. The physical storage will be replaced by virtual or cloud storage that will eliminate the 
risks and dilemmas that the current physical storage of MODEL is facing. There is still room for improvement for MODEL Auto and 
Equipment Supplies with the implementation of an ERP Software such as the consignment process that could reduce their inventory 
costs also not just in purchasing processes but to other processes as well.

Abstract  
 
The goal of this study is to design a system/user interface for inbound and outbound materials in the warehouse with 
the use of a cell phone application that is linked in the ERP system of the company. Shelf management, inbound and 
outbound operations were the operations that have been improved by implementing the use of QR code scanning in 
the application. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) was utilized in identifying processes that involve personnel to make 
decisions and actions that can lead to human error that can contribute to decreasing the warehouse’s operational 
effectiveness. Questionnaire was given to the R/M Warehouse supervisor, leader and staff. The questionnaire was 
designed to: 1.) find common problem/s met in warehouse processes and task 2.) Collect suggestions for system 
improvement and design 3.) Identify user requirement/s for the system. A total of 37 warehouse personnel of Company 
Y took part last January 19, 2021 in answering the questionnaire. Out of the 37 participants 5(14%) are leaders and 
32(87%) warehouse staff assigned various tasks. Process was reviewed as well by utilizing the HIPO chart and was 
able to identify processes that involve personnel to make decisions and actions that can lead to human error that can 
contribute to decreasing the warehouse’s operational effectiveness. The comparison shows unnecessary operations 
were eliminated after the use of the warehouse application thus it reduces manpower work hours needed to perform 
the warehouse processes and it eliminates paper records that can lead to encoding inaccurate information in the ERP 
system.

1. Introduction 
Shoe industry is continuously growing. Followed by the latest report published by Credence Research, Inc. ""Global 
Footwear Market - Growth, Future Prospects and Competitive Analysis, 2018-2026,"" the market was valued at US$ 
222.4 Bn in 2017, expected to grow at the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 3.1% from 2018 to 2026. 
Heightening demand for sports and designer shoes is the reason behind the emergence of the footwear market. 
Footwear comprises athletic and non-athletic; footwear is made up of various materials such as leather, plastic, and 
rubber among others. Purchase of footwear has doubled over the past few decades and introduction of different designs 
and styles has helped to retain customers and nabbed attention of the new customers as well. (Marketers Media, 2018). 
 
Company – X is a duly registered as corporation, established in 2015 to engage in manufacturing and exporting 
premium footwear for various international brands such as CCC & ZZZ. Its main customers are international brands. 
At full capacity, it can employ at least 2,500 workers from around the province of Pampanga and its environs.

Computing the benefits to cost ratio. It is presumably that in any project the benefits should be greater than the cost 
or the ratio between two factors must be greater than 1. Below is the computation of the benefits-cost ratio.  
The benefits cost ratio can be computed by dividing the total cost by the total benefits. The total cost is PHP 52,000 
and the total monthly benefit is PHP 96,000. The benefit-cost ratio is 5.42 in the first month of implementation. In the 
succeeding months of implementation, the initial cost will be removed from the total monthly cost. If only the monthly 
cost will be considered the benefit-cost ratio will increase to 10.4.

6. Conclusion 
The use of new emerging technology is promising and will significantly improve the performance of a business. It is 
a major factor that will help the firm to achieve a competitive advantage to competitors. In any industry with simplified 
operation will greatly increase efficiency and productivity. This will increase operational effectiveness. We can 
conclude that by using the warehouse application, most repetitive tasks such as encoding, and recording can be 
eliminated and will decrease the number of personnel needed to support the warehouse operations when it comes to 
inventory management and inbound/ outbound of materials. There has been additional use of the application aside 
from its main purpose, checking of inventory has been simplified and the margin of error in receiving and sending of 
materials quantity has been reduced greatly. 
 
The cost benefit analysis also proves that the initial investment that will be spent on the system will be beneficial. The 
benefit-cost ratio will be 3.56 after the 1st month of implementation. The study only focuses on the 3 major processes 
in the shoe manufacturing warehouse and can be further extended to other processes such as: incoming material quality 
checking, regular material inventory, long term material tracking and many more. A more precise calculation on the 
cost and benefits analysis can be done if the warehousing system will be developed.

Abstract  
 
This research is based on two problematic situations: the poor performance of the Help Desk process in a public 
institution, and the absence of a methodology to improve processes appropriate to Peruvian reality and in particular to 
a public institution. Therefore, the objective of the research is to improve the Help Desk in a public institution, through 
a disruptive strategy using a new BPM-Six Sigma-Kaisen integrative methodology supported by ICT.  
 
This methodology comprises six phases: Business Modeling, Define, Measure, Analyze, and Improve with IT, 
Simulate and Control, in each of the six phases, business, quality and statistical techniques tools are used with correctly 
sampled, measured and analyzed data. It is concluded that the application of the new methodology allows: obtain a 
more efficient process, optimize the values of KPIs: registered incidents, resolved incidents, duration of attention and 
user satisfaction and thus ensure that tasks generate value for users.

1. Introduction  
Customer satisfaction is one of the essential objectives for any company that seeks to build customer loyalty (Acosta 
2018), which is why most organizations worldwide are focused on providing a high-quality service, becoming an 
important objective, but it is also an   difficult process and arduous to apply in organizations (Martínez 2020). 
 
To measure customer satisfaction, the organization “Ciudadanos al Día” carried out a general measurement, based on 
a sample of 11,711 surveys in 123 public institutions in the 25 regions of Peru, the result of which was that 51% of 
citizens expressed satisfaction with the service provided by public institutions see figure 1. In summary, there is a low 
level of citizen satisfaction in relation to the quality of care of the services offered in the entities of the Peruvian public 
administration, detecting the main defects in order to establish opportunities for improvement (López et al. 2018).

6. Conclusion  
• 
The process improvement methodologies justified their relevance for the generation of the New 
Methodology. 
• 
The Systemic Thinking is a good integrating element of Methodologies for the improvement of processes. 
• 
After the implementation of the New Methodology, the Help Desk process in the Public Institution was 
improved. 
• 
By applying the New Methodology, the Total Registered Incidents per day improved from a mean of 45.23 
to 50.17. 
• 
When the New Methodology was applied, the Total Incidents Resolved per day improved from a mean of 
47.13 to 50.33. 
• 
The application of the new methodology reduced the duration of customer service from a mean of 14 to 
10.53 minutes. 
• 
By applying the new methodology, customer satisfaction improved. In the pretest, only 17% of customers 
registered good and very good satisfaction. In the post test, 57% of the clients registered good and very 
good satisfaction. 
• 
In the last decade, globalization has changed the world, as organizations face new exigencies from 
stakeholders. This integrative methodology will add value to the business through the optimization of the 
Help Desk process, improves user satisfaction, it is simple to implement in public institutions, it can also be 
implemented in organizations with different areas of activity, dimensions and market positions.

Abstract
Road accidents are the most prevalent phenomena in every part of the planet in our everyday lives. Driver behavior is one of
the key elements in this dilemma. In this study three behaviors, human factor, road conditions and road safety policies, are
collected from road users situated in Johor Baharu. The purpose of the project is to discover the key elements within those
three factors that might affect motorcyclists' road accidents. A regression analysis would be conducted to identify the
significant three behavioral factors contributing to the accidents. A total of 112 riders would be selected using a simple
random sampling technique to complete the survey. The results showed that the road conditions are an important factor in
determining

recommendations based on the results may be proposed in that the local government should create an additional motorcycle
route to facilitate their travel and further strengthen the motorcycle road regulations as well. These measures can assist and
even help to prevent the road accidents among motorcyclists.

1. Introduction
In certain growing and key regions of the world the majority of motorbikes are now known and become the most
prevalent method of transportation in Malaysia. One key reason why motorbikes are so prevalent in those nations
was the substantially cheaper prices for motorcycles and the low fuel usage. Because of economic reason and
easy movement, especially because of congestion, motorcycles have become Malaysia's second most frequent
method of transport. It also has the negative consequence of road accidents, such as deadly accidents, despite the
significance of transit in the society
Nevertheless, the trend in Malaysia revealed that mortality rates have grown from the beginning of the 1990s for
motorcycle accidents in South-East Asia. Reckless driving is an important driver mistake affecting the
motorcycle accident fatality rate. It is observed that motorcyclists had taken off traffic signals about three times.
Oral. The main cause of mortality in Malaysia due to motorcycle infractions is head injury for not wearing the
helmet, Nur Sabahiah & Satoshi (2011) did in a research in Malaysia. The authors suggest that the danger of

the cases. By doing so, the research result may determine which part is highly correlated and give an idea on each individual
perspective of factor of accident among the motorcyclist.
5.4 Validation
Hypothesis Testing
In determining the hypotheses, significant value for each of the variables must be observed. Significant value should not exceed
p=0.05. The values shall be less than alpha 0.05 for the hypothesis to be accepted. From the analyses conducted, the values
obtained were: human factor, p=0.00, road safety policy p=0.01 and road condition, p=0.00. As all the values were less than
p=0.05 thus the hypothesis is accepted. All variables are having relationship to fatalities rate.
6. Conclusion
The results of this study are highly relevant in the global setting, in particular for countries pursuing methods that
are comparable to those discovered in Malaysia. Studies demonstrate that the only way to reduce risks among
motorcyclists is to establish separate lanes, in particular exclusive lanes for them. However, road maintenance
may be improved and suggestions from this research indicate a more optimum and consistent execution of the
maintenance plan should be conducted frequently. Based on the results it proves that road condition causes
accidents, and thus road safety partly relies on the proper maintenance of road surfaces. Additionally, climate and
road degradation could also contribute to accidents, therefore repairs need to be carried out often and again a
good maintenance schedule needs to be planned efficiently so that the consequent of wasteful costs such as
repairs, delays and social cost could be lessened. Malaysia's road infrastructure should pay greater attention and
develop passive and lasting solutions to prevent damage to all the key stakeholders.

Abstract 
 
This dissertation analyses the impact of culture on consumer behavior. It investigates how cultural factors influence 
consumers' decision-making process and how the local community perceives a brand. The spread of globalization has 
impacted the food and beverage industry's marketing strategy, which only stresses the importance of awareness 
regarding the relationship between a target market's culture and how it affects the consumer behavior of said target 
market. This study aims to comprehend how Indonesian culture might affect the fast-food franchise consumer behavior 
in the country. Looking at existing findings on the impact of culture on consumer behavior, this dissertation asks: does 
culture affect the visiting frequency and how the consumers perceive the brand? The definition that is used to analyze 
this phenomenon in this context is Indonesian food culture. 
 
The researcher recruited McDonald's Indonesia consumers as interview participants based on the literature review and 
ways consumer behaviors relate to culture and marketing. Participants were given a set of questions they needed to 
answer in regards to this matter. Analysis of the responses showed that although culture in localized menus does not 
significantly impact customer's visiting frequency, it influences how customers perceive the brand. The results indicate 
that culture does affect consumer behavior to a certain extent. Based on this, it is recommended that researchers and 
marketers alike be mindful of one's culture when doing international marketing. Further research is needed to discover 
factors that might influence a more successful international marketing campaign.

Abstract  
 
In this paper, we analyzed various determinants of the adoption of GlobalGAP certification in Pakistan. The study 
found that higher schooling as well as financial know how increase the probability of adoption of certification. In the 
same way, training helped farmers to successfully adopt the GlobalGAP standard. As there are some additional costs 
associated with compliance to the certification, it is clear that farmers with relatively larger farm size and those who 
could access credit are more likely to adopt. On the other hand, factors such as age, experience and distance from the 
provincial capital are not significant predictors of the outcome. However, there is a requirement to assess the properties 
of GlobalGAP for Pakistani agriculture; to attain this a complete methodological idea is essential. It would make the 
agriculture sector of Pakistan more export oriented, yielding higher returns to the gross domestic production of the 
county. In this context, this study offers a valuable guideline in order to reformulate policies that would ultimately 
help to improve global competency of agriculture sector of Pakistan.

1. Introduction 
1.1. Background         
During the last couple of decades, certifications’ role across the globe had taken a remarkable place with respect to 
meeting the international market demands for food security and safety. The progressive growth of many developing 
countries including Pakistan is the consequence of the agricultural sector. With such significance of the agricultural 
sector, improvement in farm profitability and productivity is always in demand. The agriculture sector plays a vital 
role in Pakistan’s economy, like other developing economies (Imran et al., 2021; Imran & Fadillah, 2021). In Pakistan, 
19.5% of the uncultured domestic outcomes and 42.3% of the labor-pool employment accounts for the agriculture 
sector (Asfaw, Mithöfer, & Waibel, 2010a, 2010b). The agriculture sector also provides the basic material for some 
value-added sectors. An exponential increase in the country's population required a higher production level for crops

This section presents regression analysis. The primary question is to identify potential factor which may affect the 
adoption of GlobalGAP certification by farmers across Punjab province. The study takes dependent variable GAP as 
a dummy variable in order to capture whether a farmer adopted the certification or not. Table 3 shows regression 
analysis of probit model under column (1), and marginal effects of the probit model under column (2). Robust 
estimates of standard errors for each model is given in the right adjacent column. Total 228 observations are analyzed. 
The value of pseudo R squared is estimated to be 0.5125.

From the results, it is clear that both higher schooling and financial know how increase the probability of adoption of 
certification. In the same way, training helped farmers to successfully adopt the GlobalGAP standard. As there are 
some additional costs associated with compliance to the certification, it is clearer that farmers with relatively larger 
farm size and those who could access credit are more likely to adopt. On the other hand, factors such as age, experience 
and distance from the provincial capital are not significant predictors of the outcome. It is noteworthy that these finding 
are in line with the t-test estimate presented above. Note further that estimated standard errors are robust that increase 
the reliability of the models.  
6. Conclusion 
 
This study is aimed to identify various determinants of the adoption of GlobalGAP certification in Pakistan. We found 
that higher schooling and financial know how helps to increase the probability of adoption of certification. As the 
figure 1 shows that the highest motivation is to adopt the certification in order to attain high price premium for the 
certified produce. Additionally, as demonstrated by figure 2, various reasons for not adopting the certification scheme 
where high investment cost associated with compliance to certification is the most important reason. Another reason 
for not implementing the certification report by farmers is that they found it difficult to understand various requirement 
of GlobalGAP certification. Similarly, trainings are the useful sources for farmers to successfully adopt the 
GlobalGAP standard. As there are some additional costs associated with compliance to the certification, it is concluded 
that farmers with relatively larger farm size and those who could access credit are more likely to adopt. In the light of 
these finding, we draw policy recommendations for the improvement of the horticulture sector of Pakistan. In Pakistan, 
almost 20 million hectares are used for agricultural and horticultural which is almost one fourth of the total arable 
land, (PHDEC, 2015). Robust estimates of standard errors for each model is given in the right adjacent column. Total 
228 observations are analyzed. The value of pseudo R squared is estimated to be 0.5125. Of that amount only 20 
percent is considered to have the potential for intensive crop production (Irshad, 2021; Khan, 2011). In addition, the 
Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, organizations such as Pakistan Horticulture Development & Export 
Company (PHDEC) and Agribusiness Support Fund (APS) can play important role in this regard.

1776","In order to facilitate certification process, the mechanism of public-private partnerships (PPPs) can be a valuable tool. 
In additional to this, establishment of efficient national technical working groups can facilitate the adoption of 
GlobalGAP adoption. As the cost of certification process is a major factor discouraging small holders to certify, 
establishment of auditing facility locally would reduce the cost, hence it would encourage adoption process. 
Establishment of farmer organization (FOs) would be another approach. FOs would not only be helpful for farmers to 
opt for group certification, this would prove to be an effective platform for farmer training. Implementation of these 
approaches would ultimately enhance the certification in the country and would resultantly add to the expansion of 
horticultural exports. This study offers a valuable guideline in order to reformulate policies that would ultimately help 
to improve global competency of agriculture sector of Pakistan.

Abstract
Gender discrimination is a problem caused by a variety of external factors, including education, salary,
and gender roles, all of which can lead to gender inequality in various aspects of life. This statement has
finally led researchers to learn about gender equality in a Jakarta company and the factors that influence
it. The purpose of this study is to understand gender equality from the perspective of the respondent,
namely company employees. Based on several literature reviews related to factors regarding gender
inequality written in several journals, the researchers found that there are still some gender inequalities
that occur between men and women, where the dominance of men is still higher than women. Therefore,
to prove this research, the researcher intends to make a research journal by examining gender equality that
occurs in a company in Jakarta, Indonesia. With a minimum of 100 employees, the researcher uses a
questionnaire method to determine the views of the company's employees on expectations and actual
conditions that occur. SmartPLS will be used to process the obtained data in order to perform the expected
calculations. From the research results, this study concludes that there is no gender inequality in the
company based on various external and internal factors.

Abstract
This dissertation analyses the impact of social media marketing activities on the brand awareness of Unilever in
Indonesia and investigates the ways in which social media marketing activities of Unilever affect its overall brand
awareness among the local community. A differentiated business identity is expected to result in brand awareness,
one among many objectives of company branding is to create brand awareness through the maximization of social
media. The objective of this dissertation is to see the major driving factors contributing to Unilever brand awareness
in Indonesia, to identify efficient methods in sustaining Unilever Indonesia brand awareness through social media
marketing activities, and this research is also to find out how social media marketing activities affect the brand
awareness of Unilever.
The researcher collected information from the external people or the consumers of Unilever living in Indonesia and
people with interest in Unilever as a company, brands and products. Research participants are given a set of written
questions and the questions asked within the Interview revolved around respondent brand awareness on Unilever
Indonesia. The analysis showed that consumers are indeed familiar with Unilever brands, products and as a
company though it is noted that this does not apply to all Unilever brand categories. The researcher recommends
future researchers to take a deeper look into why Unilever brand categories do not have the same brand awareness
overall across the three main brand categories. Future researchers are also recommended to look for the reason
behind consumer tendencies in mistaking non-Unilever brands for Unilever brands as this information could
potentially benefit Unilever in Indonesia precisely its marketing team.

Abstract 
 
Supply chain decisions involve different entities and activities such as sourcing of material, production of goods, and 
logistics. Through the efficient management of these activities, firms can gain a competitive edge by beig responsive 
in maximizing customer value and enhance its efficiency by minimizing operating costs. Inadequate management 
results in poor replenishment processes which can, in turn, lead to lack of product availability in stores, lost sales, or 
oversupply of products, etc.. Accurate demand forecasting plays a crucial role in reducing these problems by providing 
precise quantities required to order and store to satisfy the customer demands, reduce inventory and production costs, 
reduce safety stocks and transportation, and improve replenishment processes. However, demand forecasting for 
products, mainly perishable goods can be challenging for firms. Many companies, such as retailers, have struggles in 
accurately predicting future demand. Suppliers usually have a bulk shipment process that can cause inventory 
differences for the retailer's desires. Furthermore, without proper information sharing between a retailer and its 
suppliers, mismanagement of order quantities and production can occur. Recently, these problems are tackled through 
the adoption of collaboration models between supplier and retailer. More precisely, companies are encouraged to 
integrate inventory management models to order when required. The integrated model enhances the demand planning, 
inventory control and replenishment processes in the supply chain. Nonetheless, the investments in such 
methodologies are costly for both suppliers and retailers alike. Moreover, the benefits from implementing these models 
are not clear in monetary terms and are not widely discussed in the literature. This research aims to improve inventory 
management of a retailer located in the United Arab Emirates that is facing issues with its replenishment and 
forecasting processes. To achieve this purpose, forecasting models such as ARIMA, exponential smoothings and 
machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were built and tested for the highest accuracy. 
The results show that forecast models ARIMA and average of ARIMA and triple exponential smoothing achieve the 
best accuracy, i.e., the least forecasting error value. Implementing the forecast model needs coordination and 
collaboration between the supply chain entities. Therefore, collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment 
collaborative, CPFR, was suggested for the retailer’s supply chain through a specific framework. Finally, the benefits 
of the collaboration framework in terms of transportation costs were displayed using discrete-event simulation. Several 
scenarios and parameters were tested. Adopting the CPFR collaborative framework could reduce the transportation 
cost for some retail items by 42% evident in the simulation.

Abstract  
 
In the Philippines, the demand for delivery services has paved the way for the rise of various delivery companies. 
Hence, the competition among these couriers is increasing. In order for them to gain competitive advantage, their 
services must make a difference. The present study compared the customer satisfaction on the services offered by 
Philippine couriers based on the five SERVQUAL dimensions. Also, the couriers were ranked based on customer 
ratings through using Analytic Hierarchy Process. Furthermore, this research determined the specific dimensions and 
strategies which could help the couriers improve the quality of their service through using Prioritization Matrix and 
Quality Function Deployment. The data were collected through a survey distributed to 270 respondents within NCR. 
The AHP show that Gogo Xpress had the highest customer rating, and it was followed by Fastrack Courier Services, 
J&T Express and NinjaVan Philippines. Moreover, the prioritization matrix implied that Gogo Xpress had competitive 
advantages for all dimensions, Fastrack had advantage for assurance and reliability, while J&T Express had advantage 
concerning responsiveness. Lastly, from the QFD, the importance ratings show that couriers must prioritize the 
components of services: rating system for riders and employee and personnel training.

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background 
The past few decades have witnessed rapid development in the economy and the industry. During the 
contemporary era, the service industry had progressively begun to emerge, and it has currently become on par with 
the manufacturing and agricultural industries which used to serve as primary drivers of the economy (Liu et al., 2005). 
For the past twenty years, service industries are becoming a large component of economic output along with other 
industries, hence, the gradual shift from an industrial to a service economy is natural and inevitable as time goes by 
(Cheng, 2013; Kon, 1997).  
The service industry is very broad in nature; it encompasses a wide scope of activities, ranging from 
transportation, education, medical services, banking, and telecommunications in which all of these are essential to the 
functioning of the society and the economy. According to Ranasinghe (2021), no economy can survive without the 
service sector especially during the present time.  
One of the renowned industries which provides services to the community is the delivery courier services – 
these are businesses which facilitates the transport and delivery of documents and packages. These industries could 
have various specializations including express and local shipping, regional shipping, and shipping services all over 
the world (Karcz & Slusarczyk, 2016). Along with the expansion of E-commerce, the demand for delivery courier 
services has also increased. Primarily, during the pandemic where community restrictions are imposed, these services

The customer wants and needs were assigned weights based on the degree of importance as perceived by the 
customers. Customer wants were related to service ‘how’s’ through the relationship matrix. With reference to the 
customer important ratings and each of the corresponding weights of the dimensions, the importance ratings were 
computed. The importance ratings show that the components of services that must be prioritized by the couriers were 
the rating system for riders as well as the employee and personnel training. These had ratings of 3.948 and 3.820, 
respectively. Both components are vital to the courier services especially if they want to be competitive within the 
industry.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The primary goal of this study was to compare customer satisfaction among the Philippine delivery courier 
services based on the five SERVQUAL measurements. Also, the researchers ranked these delivery couriers through 
the use of Analytic Hierarchy Process. The study had also determined the specific dimensions which could help the 
delivery couriers improve the quality of their service by using Prioritization Matrix and Quality Function Deployment 
(QFD). In essence, the aforementioned objectives were successfully fulfilled by the researchers.  
 
In summary, the results obtained in AHP show that Gogo Xpress has led the rankings among the different 
couriers in the Philippines. It was followed by Fastrack, J&T Express and NinjaVan Philippines, correspondingly. 
This indicates that Gogo Xpress had been the most preferred courier service on the basis of customer satisfaction. 
Moreover, the results acquired from the prioritization matrix had specified the dimensions where each delivery courier 
services had competitive advantages. With reference to the matrices, Gogo Xpress had competitive advantages for all 
dimensions, Fastrack had competitive advantage with regards to assurance and reliability, while J&T Express had 
advantage concerning responsiveness. For the QFD, the importance ratings show that the components of services that 
must be prioritized by the couriers were the rating system for riders as well as the employee and personnel training; 
these would help the courier services to be competitive within the industry. Indeed, it is important for the businesses 
in the service industries to satisfy the customers because the voice of the customer is very significant since this will 
play a significant role in the profitability and much more long-term survival of the business.

Abstract  
Motor Vehicle (MV) Registration issue per se has been plaguing the National Capital Region (NCR) and resulted in 
many temporary remedies and changes in the LTO system.  This eventually has caused headaches both for LTO and 
private owners, as having lost in productivity, time and effort, extra cost and contracting fixers in the area.  The 
growing demand for a fixed viable process has caused havoc in the LTO and thirst for a new methodology in its 
system.  In an attempt to solve this particular issue, a new automation and auto verification (AutoCheck) via online of 
MV may address the issue.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1. Background of the Study 
 
The laws and regulations imposed are the breathing ground for civilization to be in order, without it man will be in 
chaos.  From time in the beginning to modern period, transportation has been a service, a mode of life and a lifestyle.  
In fact, the invention of automobile (or MV) made life easier in moving people and goods from one place to another 
and back.  In the Philippines, as the population grows, MVs have also been growing rapidly each year.  Almost all 
Filipino households own at least one mode of transportation and, laws will have to govern their mobility.  This brought 
about the creation of the Philippine LTO, to strictly implement and enforce the laws regarding land transportation.  It 
is a Sectoral Office of the Department of Transportation (DOTr), formerly known as the Department of Transportation 
and Communication (DOTC). 
 
The first law relating to transportation was Act No. 2159 of 1912, enacted to regulate MVs and to provide for regulation 
and licensing of operators.  The provision of the law created a Section tasked to take charge of MVs and drivers’ 
licenses.  In 1922, Act No. 3045 was passed into law compiling and incorporating all previous laws governing MVs; 
while in 1933, Act No. 3992, Revised Motor Vehicle Law, was enacted renaming the Automobile Division to Division 
of Motor Vehicles (DMV); and in 1947, Executive Order No. 94 was promulgated upgrading the office of DMV to 
Motor Vehicles Office (MVO) and categorized it as a Bureau. 
 
Consequently, industrialization advanced and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), in 1961, 
transferred the function of collecting the registration fees from city treasurers to various vehicle agencies of the MVO.  
In 1964, Republic Act (RA) 4136 or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code was enacted abolishing the MVO and 
created the Land Transportation Commission (LTC).  Its function, mainly, to “control as far as they apply, the 
registration and operation of motor vehicles and the licensing of owners, dealers, conductors, drivers and similar 
matters (LTO Press Release, 2016).” Similar matters include enforcing traffic rules and regulations, and adjudicating 
apprehensions. With this mandate, LTC established several regional offices in various parts of the Philippines.  In 
1979, Executive Order No. 546 was promulgated and renamed the LTC as Bureau of Land Transportation (BLT). In 
1 drawn from previous IE110-OR topic proposal, “A Review of Philippine Land Transportation Office (LTO) in Dealing 
with Online Transactions Incorporating The System of Automobile Checking (AutoCheck).”

1795","Based on Figure 3 and as elaborated on Table 3, the process flow of the proposed automated system is systematized 
with less actual waiting time. 
 
 
In this regard, the impending situations and other circumstances happening, whether avoidable or unavoidable delay, 
in all transactions or activities in the LTO would be dependent on allowance factors.  An avoidable delay happens 
when an operation or transaction to be done in an LTO branch is interrupted, which is solely under the control of the 
Bureau or LTO in registering a MV that could have been prevented under any normal operating time in the LTO.  In 
this case, limiting the number of queues in the process of actually or physically bringing a MV for all transactions and 
based on the on-site capacity of the LTO.  
 
On the other hand, an unavoidable delay occurs when a transaction is postponed due to an uncontrollable situation or 
circumstance happening outside the LTO’s responsibility, or the person registering the MV. For instance, force 
majeure or unforeseeable circumstances that may happen and cannot be prevented.  Fire or flood may occur, all 
computers become offline, or the person registering a MV had an emergency.   
 
The current LTO system (in Figure 1), being implemented and practiced, takes longer time and requires physical 
presence at an LTO branch in all 7 steps of the registration process. On the other hand, the proposed automated system 
will prove to be more efficient and convenient in the processing time. Only the last 3 steps of current LTO system is 
required to be processed on-site, as it is mandatory to have the MV inspected at the chosen LTO branch, while the 
first 4 steps are done online or in an automated transaction at the convenience of the MV owner’s time. 
 
5. Recommendation and Conclusion 
 
The study examined the Philippine LTO in its enforcement of or implementation of the applicable and existing laws 
of the land with regard to MV Registration. Such examination exposed the fundamental flaws in the Bureau with 
corresponding delays in checking the MV records, antiquated methods, practices of registration and issuing of the 
ORs.  This has been chronic from time in memorial. Adding insult to the injury, the limited period imposed per LTO 
district on the number of individuals allowed to transact in a day has been chaotic at all times. The fact that the LTO 
is a bureau that generate income, did not avail of the opportunity offered in the modern 21st century. It did not take 
advantage of modernizing its equipment and utilities. The lack of information, advancement and improvement have 
placed the Bureau to a testing ground, proved to be necessary, of calling a new process or system that will be consistent 
for all generations to come. There is a need to recalibrate its system to adapt to the modern technology of online MV 
registration, at least conduct an online AutoChecking of MV in a speedy manner.  It is expected that there are other 
ways of recalibration/reconfiguration of the systems to be undertaken in the future. The writers are hoping that this 
proposal-study becomes a proverbial pebble that will cause ripples to emerging online MV Registration of the LTO 
system. Gradual changes are good, but actual transition of modernizing a system is even better. 
   
It is not farfetched for the LTO to implement a better and modern online means of MV Registration and AutoCheck, 
aside from the fact that the Bureau is an earning agency, its LTMS has already established LIVE websites to 138 
identified sites of all LTOs in the Philippines, with 113 sites already been awarded to private operators.  It means that 
these 138 sites are already running, pilot tested, and actual testing connectivity from those sites rendering MV reports 
to LTO LTMS website.  This does not have a public users accessibility yet, which means it is still under restriction 
that only an exclusive accessing of result-data by the Bureau only.  However, during an interview with LTO-
Information and Communication Technology (ICT), it was discussed that the LTMS is new within the LTO online 
system.  It is an online registration, wherein PMVIC renders its result or report of inspection right after every MV 
inspection conducted.  Mr. MJ Datu, LTO-ICT Consultant, mentioned that the LTMS website will eventually be open 
to public users to easily access an online registration, not just for MV but for other LTO services.  Sadly, as of 29 
January 2021 of the interview date, LTMS website is not yet for public users’ advantage. 
 
In reiterating the writers’ hope that this proposal-study will eventually be an eye-opener that the LTO Philippines is 
capable of having an interactive AutoChecking system and capable of finding easier methods despite the pandemic, 
and inspite of the IT issues of internet connectivity.  Therefore, there must be a reliable-dependable-fixed and viable 
LTO system for public online users. Also, this proposal-study is timely applicable as the pandemic requires all to have 
social distancing, having an Online MV Registration befits the current environmental scenario.

1803","These findings about the system utilized by LTO suggest a need for future research that can either suggest an integrated 
study on MV online registration or in another separate but limited research on other services provided by LTO, such 
as driver’s license application to be online, other classifications of MVs and electric powered-vehicles.   
 
Initially, assessment of an old process flow identifies the contextual factors and procedures that are associated without 
online users’ involvement.  Also, it identifies a possible research in diverse studies, highlighting important contextual 
factors of delays.  The avoidable and unavoidable delays specified various outcomes in improving the quality of LTO 
implementations in all MV Registrations.  The writers successfully satisfied all 3 objectives, however, without any 
recommended studies, given the resources or earning capacity of the Bureau, including governance issues that it may 
entail, the writers regretfully conclude that this would not be feasible without allowing the online users’ involvement 
in the online MV registration.

Abstract 
 
South Africa has seen a substantial rise in the number of students enrolling in higher institutions as a matter 
of fact these students need transportation to access universities activities. The main purpose of this study 
was to determine the effect of transportation related challenges of non-resident students, from the Auckland 
Park Bunting Road (APB) campus at the University of Johannesburg to their place of residence and vice 
versa. To comprehend transportation related challenges, the objectives focused on analysing the choice of 
transport mode, distances and duration of trips, transportation cost and specific transportation challenges 
students experience. Using a survey questionnaire, data were collected from 309 non-resident students at 
APB campus. Around a third of respondents (34%) indicated to reside in suburbs neighbouring the APB 
campus. The findings indicated that transportation challenges affected about 75% of non-resident student’s 
attendance and participative energy in class. Less than a third of respondents (29%) indicated that the ideal 
mode of transport is the free inter-campus bus as part of their transportation networks. Surprisingly, none 
of students cycle to access this university. On time transportation service, safety, availability, cost and 
comfort are some of the essential challenges experienced as some of academic programs are scheduled 
early morning or evening.

1. Introduction  
Since the early 1990s, South Africa has seen a significant increase in the number of students enrolled in higher 
education institutions (Council of Higher Education, 2016). In this same context, the University of Johannesburg (UJ) 
has experienced rapid growth, by 2017 a total of 50, 429 students had enrolled for under-graduate and post-graduate 
degrees (UJ HEMIS, 2018). Enrolled students include both local and international students studying at the institution, 
although some students are expected to reside on campus, while others remain non-resident. As seen across the globe, 
universities continue to take a more principal role in equipping, educating and trains the new generations of engineers, 
economist, managers, politicians, and other professionals with the skills and principles needed to implement a circular 
economy (Bonnett, 2012; de la Torre, Onggo, Corlu, Nogal & Juan, 2021). As a matter of fact, there is a limited 
accommodation capacity for all students to reside on campus. Therefore, all non-resident students are forced to make 
use of any mode of transport to access higher education and attend lectures.  The term non-resident student is used to 
describe a student who lives away from campus also known as off-campus students. For example, in 2018, as many 
as 36 372 undergraduate students and 7 274 post-graduate students were non-resident students (86%). All these latter 
students are responsible for their accommodations and own transportation to and from the university campuses because 
the university does not have the necessary funds to provide transport from all the different locations where students 
are residing to the campuses (UJ HEMIS, 2018). As matter of fact, UJ transportation network services are very limited 
network to campuses destination without any deviations. Arriving on time and safely at campus and returning home 
or to places of residence can be challenging. Kasayira, Chimpandambira and Hungwe (2007) found that transportation 
is part of the seven most common stressors university students in neighbouring Zimbabwe face beside finance, library 
resources and study material, accommodation, food, inadequate and lecturer related problems. If not addressed, the 
problem will expand and non-resident students will develop a complete evasion behaviour, which will manifest itself

Abstract 
 
Recent supply chain targets have led to decreased response time requests also causing enterprises invest for automation 
technologies for efficient management for their warehouses. In this paper, we focus on an automated warehousing 
environment where there are robotic order pickers travelling on ground flexibly throughout aisles. We develop 
deadlock and collision prevention algorithms for safely travel of those robotic order pickers. The developed algorithms 
can be utilized by any warehouse system having autonomous vehicles (e.g., automated guided vehicles, mobile robots, 
or shuttles in a multi-tier automated warehouse) that can travel between aisles freely. While developing those smart 
algorithms, we also aim to improve some performance metrics such as average flow time and, maximum flow time of 
a transaction in the system.  To test the performance of the algorithms, we model the system as a multi-agent system, 
where autonomous vehicles are able to communicate with each other under an Internet of Things (IoT) environment. 
We compare that flexible system design with a dedicated design where a dedicated vehicle is assigned for a pre-
defined number of aisles. The experimental results show that under well-designed deadlock and collision prevention 
control algorithm, flexible travel of vehicles can provide advantage compared to dedicated design.

1. Introduction 
By the rapid growth of e-commerce that is also a result of COVID-19 outbreaks, an unprecedented rise in the number 
of online shoppers has revealed. Intralogistics sector is facing new challenges by that effect. For instance, recent e-
commerce increase has also shifted order profile towards increased product variability, decreased delivery time and 
flexible delivery options. To overcome those challenges, investing on warehouse automation technologies providing 
high transaction rate, decreased errors, under those complicated demand profile requests could be an option. For 
instance, recently enterprises are very eager to deploy goods with RFID tags helping efficiently implementation of 
robotic material handling technologies.  The growth estimation for the Global Warehouse Automation Market is at a 
CAGR of 14% between 2020 and 2026 which is estimated to be doubled to $30 billion by 2026 (Research and Markets, 
2021). 
 
Increase in e-commerce, has also caused the material handling equipment market growth.  For instance, the Material 
Handling Market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.01% to reach US$ 201.057 billion by 2025, from US $141.657 
billion in 2019 (Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence, 2020). Fig. 1 shows the current and estimated material handling 
market growth based on product types.  
 
Based on Fig. 1, automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RSs) are predicted to witness the fastest growth during 
the forecast period. The AS/RS technology providers aim to develop system designs providing reduced floor space, 
labor cost, and inventory levels to enhance productivity while reducing manufacturing cycle time. For instance, a

shuttle-based storage and retrieval system (SBS/RS) mostly utilized in distribution centers and raw material stores that 
are specially designed for ultra-high-speed load handling (Dematic Multi-shuttle, 2021). Because there is a dedicated 
shuttle in each tier of an aisle, this automated warehousing technology is referred as aisle and tier-captive SBS/RS in 
literature. Note that, the collision and deadlock prevention algorithms provided by this paper can also be utilized by

Verification and validation of the models are done by observing consistent performance metric values for models, 
FSD and DSD as well as by debugging and tracing the models by animating, Also, degenerate tests show the 
correctness of the developed model. For instance, when the arrival rate of the transactions is increased in the system, 
U, λ, MFT, and SD values tend to increase. And, an increase in V and a cause a decrease in FT value. As a result, the 
experiments are found to be suitable for interpretation. Additionally, low variability between simulation replications 
means that the model is internally valid. 
 
7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we focus on an automated warehousing environment where there are robotic order pickers travelling on 
ground flexibly throughout aisles. We develop flexible travel algorithms for those robotic order pickers throughout 
the storage racks so that they do not collide with each other. The developed algorithms can be utilized for any 
warehouse system having autonomous vehicles (i.e., automated guided vehicles, mobile robots, or shuttles in a multi-
tier automated warehouse) that can travel between rack aisles freely in a facility. While developing those smart 
algorithms, we aim to improve some critical performance metrics: average flow time of a transaction, maximum flow 
time of a transaction as well as variance of travel times in the system.  To test the performance of the algorithms, we 
model the system by a multi-agent simulation model, where autonomous vehicles are able to communicate with each 
other under an IoT environment. We compare those flexible travel system designs with their dedicated system designs 
where in the dedicated system design, a dedicated AMR is assigned for a pre-defined number of aisles. The 
experimental results show under a well-designed deadlock and collision prevention control algorithm the flexible 
travel of vehicles can provide advantageous compared to dedicated design. And, it is also observed that up to 22% 
improvement in average flow time value and 60% in maximum flow time value can be achieved by this design.   
 
As future works, more racking designs as well as smart control algorithms can be considered to observe better 
performance results from the system.

Abstract 
 
Supply chain management and logistics play an essential role in the airline catering business. The airlines’ cost 
reduction strategies have recently shifted the focus from culinary aspects to supply chain management. This research 
aims to understand the unique characteristics,  operational challenges and emerging trends of the airline catering 
supply chain. This research paper has chosen an exploratory and qualitative method based on an analysis of the current 
literature within supply chain management in the airline catering service. In addition, the findings from the case study 
presented in this paper are used to reveal more facts and add to the existing body of knowledge. An analysis was 
conducted by applying the five forces business analysis model proposed by Michael Porter to demonstrate the industry 
structure and identify the value of effective supply chain management in the airline catering industry. In addition, an 
empirical study of the airline catering service strategy of an airline catering organisation in the U.K. has been 
presented. Furthermore, a representation of the airline catering supply chain characteristics has been demonstrated 
with the processes of the SCOR model. Also, this paper seeks to understand the operational challenges and examines 
the emerging trends in the airline catering supply chain. Finally, the study concludes that supply chain management 
can offer enormous potential to improve service effectiveness and add economic value for airline catering industries.

1. Introduction 
The onboard dining experience is an essential attribute for airline passengers’ satisfaction. Airlines are making a great 
effort to improve the quality of their in-flight food and drinks services.  The airline catering business is rapidly 
evolving, and the organisations in this industry have to operate in a demanding and time-sensitive business 
environment (Jones, 2004). They need to be effective and innovative in their catering services to maintain and improve 
their competitive position. The nature of airline catering service has changed with the ever-changing aspects of aircraft 
capacity to satisfy the requirements of carrying more passengers to the destinations. As the aircraft size and the 
capacity growth, the onboard galley areas become smaller. An essential consideration for the airline catering product 
design is weight distribution to fuel ratio. In current days, onboard logistics, weight and cost determine the inflight 
meal concept. Effective supply chain management is a key aspect of the airline’s ability to provide their passengers 
with a high-quality dining experience onboard (Sundarakani, Abdul Razzak and Manikandan, 2018). But it has always 
been challenging for airline catering companies to manage the large volume of meals from the kitchen to aircraft and 
the reverse flow of equipment and unused items in a very complex environment (Kumar, Sharma and Agarwal, 2015). 
As a general observation, they seem to be inefficient and uneconomical. The level of developments in the airline 
catering supply chain can facilitate or constrain the economic performance of the airline industry. Therefore, various 
aspects of airline catering supply chains need to be explored in the growing market with its own distinctiveness. The 
research in this paper was to recognise the unique characteristics of supply chain management in the airline catering 
industry, understand the service strategy, highlight the operational challenges, and examine the emerging trends from 
the airline catering industry. For this research, we studied existing literature about airline catering and interviewed the 
supply chain professionals from one large airline catering organisation in the U.K. The below diagram in Figure 1 
shows the three stages of analysis and the research framework used in this study.

1831","travel via an online platform upto one hour before departure. Online food delivery service company will directly 
deliver the freshly prepared meals to the flight, and cabin crew will serve them to the right passengers. This innovative 
catering service also makes it possible to reduce food waste by avoiding the large number of meals being prepared 
and loaded onto the aircraft but not consumed by the passengers.     
 
Airline needs the real-time visibility. Supply chain visibility in airline catering is required to take the next step forward, 
leveraging the real-time data integration end to end. Airline catering organisations must focus on integrating IT 
systems and business processes to improve their internal logistics to increase operational transparency (Mitro, 1998). 
Customers need to know the overall airline catering supply chain, especially the real-time view of the logistics; where 
the meal sets are, where they are being prepared, where they are being assembled, and what’s the quality of meals, 
Are service providers meeting airline customer’s SLAs, and so many other key metrics. Without relevant management 
information, it’s hard to make decisions and difficult for effective control in managing catering logistics and the supply 
chain cost. This can lead to inefficient airline catering operations, a high inventory of expensive stock and the inability 
to eliminate the non-value-added costs from the airline catering logistics process. An integrated logistics system is 
needed to ensure that this visibility tightly connected to the logistics execution.  From the visibility, airlines can make 
better decisions, caterers can take direct action, and can change their logistics functions to meet the airline’s needs. 
Supply chains are moving from the linear model to agile principles. Stakeholders in the airline catering supply chain 
are trying to implement new strategies to achieve agility (Law, 2011). The airline catering business demands more 
and more innovation. Airlines want to introduce new catering products and services. The airline market is more 
competitive today than it was before. The responsive time needs to go down. Ultimately, the airline catering supply 
chain and logistics service need to be as agile as airlines can think of new innovative ideas and business models 
(Ivanovic and Vujic, 2007). 
 
Reducing waste is one of the critical sustainability strategies for airlines (Jones, 2012). Airlines have started effective 
recycling of food and using environmentally friendly packaging with the support of systems and technologies. While 
this initiate avoids landfilling, it also provides a new source of revenue stream for airlines. Single-use plastics 
contribute to catering waste. Catering service providers introduce sustainable alternative packagings and recycling 
solutions to reduce the waste. They can eliminate plastic waste by sourcing biodegradable cutleries and cups. Airlines 
are needed to comply with the industry’s commitment to reducing CO2 emissions. To support this, airlines are keen 
to implement carbon reduction projects and initiatives. This includes operating more fuel-efficient aircraft, catering 
waste management and reducing catering load.  Prevention of catering waste is the most preferred method, and 
disposal is the least preferred method in the catering waste management hierarchy. Implementing good supply chain 
practices to control catering waste prevention and the reduction will reduce the amount of waste that reach landfills 
through disposal. This include supplier management, inventory management, good menu planning, appropriate 
workflow design and required training (Thamagasorn and Pharino, 2019).    Reverse logistics must implement proper 
catering waste management to reduce the environmental impact. They collaborate with recycling companies to 
transform biofuel from organic catering waste instead of traditional waste disposal methods as food waste that ends 
up in landfills or oceans creates additional environmental burdens. Its organic contents are easily biodegradable and 
generate greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the atmosphere (Mahmood, Parshetti 
and Balasubramanian, 2016). In addition to addressing the environmental concerns, Airlines becoming more focused 
on corporate social responsibilities (CSR). Catering service providers help airlines make charitable donations through 
partnerships with other aid organisations or airline’s own charity foundations to support communities.  A catering 
company can partner with airlines to take CSR initiatives by donating excess foods to charities as they recover quite 
many untouched meals such as packed snacks, biscuits, unopened drinks, pre-packaged sandwiches and bakery 
products from return flights.   
 
6. Conclusion 
The main objectives of this research were to understand the advancements in supply chain management in the airline 
catering industry, to analyse the suitable supply chain for catering service, to present the challenges and trends in the 
airline catering supply chain, and to demonstrate that supply chain management as a strategic function can add 
economic values to both caterers and the airlines. Effective supply chain management enables huge reduction of costs 
by developing inflight products and implement service strategy with airlines, caterers, and suppliers, securing the 
airlines’ competitive prices. Offering a complete supply chain solution, catering service providers provide the right 
inflight products at the right time to the right aircraft at the right condition at the right cost, which is the ultimate 
objective in the airline catering supply chain.

1840","Analysis of market structure and competitive situation suggest that the airline catering industry is attractive in 
emerging markets. Case study findings recognise the Assemble-To-Order (ATO) supply chain design is suitable for 
airline catering business that engages in mass customisation and requires a responsive supply chain. The research also 
highlights some operational challenges such as the growth of passenger traffic, cost pressure, airline disruption, food 
safety, aviation security, and sustainability which affect the airline catering industry. It discusses some emerging trends 
like outsourcing, digitalisation, automation, meal preordering, supply chain visibility and agility in the airline catering 
industry. The limitation of this research is that some findings are from deep observation of a single case study. Some 
responses could be biased, may not truly reflect the view of the entire industry. This research can be further extended 
to examine multiple case studies in different size airline catering organisations in different regions to analyse the 
global airline catering supply chain.  Future investigations can also include more quantitative analysis to compare their 
competitive structure, positioning and suitable supply chain design according to different business models 
geographically. This paper contributes to both the literature in airline catering operations and the supply chain 
management literature by recognising some critical research areas related to both fields. Furthermore, this study helps 
academic researchers and business leaders better understand the complexity of supply chain management in the airline 
catering service and concludes that airline catering organisations should consider supply chain management as a 
strategic function  that offers enormous potential for improving service effectiveness and adding economic value for 
airline catering industries.

5. Conclusion  
The main target of the presented work was to perform Non-Newtonian flows simulations using the open source 
computational framework OpenFOAM. The rheological model according to Papanastasiou was implemented in 
transport models library of OpenFOAM. The rheological data was collected from the results of experimental 
procedures for concentrated phosphate slurry rheological characterization. Results show that the required energy for 
pumping depends on the rheological characteristic of the transported material. Additionally, the solutions of our 
simulation method is compared with the results of semi analytical method, which shows that CFD computations can 
be very useful at an industrial level. These findings can be exploited for a better control of concentrated phosphate 
slurries, which allow the mineral industry to improve its logistic chain.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays society uses online food deliveries which aim to increase people’s productivity by providing convenient 
services. Retailing is a method of supplying services to a manufacturer and selling them to customers. Face-to-face 
contact is replaced with online retail sales which makes contact through internet-based platforms. In this study, the 
researchers focused on establishing the factors affecting the performances of online food deliveries among GrabFood, 
Foodpanda, and Zomato Ph. They aim to assess the current online food delivery system, identify significant factors 
affecting online food delivery time and efficiency, and recommend ways to improve the current online food delivery 
system. The data was collected by having an online survey questionnaire for 200 respondents. The data were analyzed 
by using statistical and analytical tools such as descriptive statistics, SWOT analysis, ANOVA test, correlation 
analysis multiple regression analysis, risk assessment, and benchmarking. The findings revealed that the most crucial 
factor in an online food delivery application is the delivery factor followed by the process and the interface. The 
researchers have identified the significant relationships among the demographics, the subfactors of interface, process, 
and delivery and concluded that the delivery’s subfactor has the most significant factors that could affect the online 
food delivery companies.

1. Introduction 
Retailing is a distribution process of a retailer by procuring goods and services from a distributor and selling it in small 
lots to a large number of customers. According to Dawson (2010), food retailing is a highly innovative sector within 
the entire food chain. E-commerce is growing rapidly and the food industry is also showing steady growth (Alagoz 
and Hekimoglu 2012). Sethu and Saini (2016) stated that E-commerce has overwhelmingly pervaded the lives of 
people as it helps them in managing their time better. Given the field of study, it is vital to know the importance of E-
commerce in the business industry. Prior studies on food ordering have investigated that customers are most likely to 
use their mobile phones since online delivery has been increasing over the years as the online environment offers 
excellent opportunities for interactive and personalized marketing (Burke, 2002). Older adults are becoming a 
significant potential market for future service because they are becoming more familiar as they engage in various e-
commerce activities such as online shopping (Zickuhr 2010). However, students are reluctant when making an online 
transaction and believe that there should be an effective and efficient measurement taken to enhance the trust between 
the customers and the service providers (Farah et al. 2018). The quality and reliability of the product, when made 
available online, should not be compromised along with the application safety of payment gateway and personal

Table 9 shows the evaluated characteristics that indicate the differences of each factor in an online food delivery 
application. It shows the characteristics, weaknesses, and comparison of each online food delivery platform and what 
is the best practice for each factor from the best local online platform and the best international online platform. 
Overall it can be seen that GrabFood, Foodpanda, and Zomato Ph have a different description of the metrics in terms 
of the (3) factors: the interface, process, and delivery. GrabFood, Foodpanda, and Zomato Ph were compared and 
described under the different metrics to see their differences and similarities, and if it acquires the standards of Best 
Local Online and Best International platforms. The type of benchmarking is Functional in which it does not directly 
compete rather than it compares the results to best in class processes and practices. It improves performance through 
the continuous identification, understanding, and adaptation of external practices and processes identified within and 
outside the organization. It was shown that the delivery’s subfactors have the most significant factors that could affect 
online food delivery companies, and the least is the factor interface. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this research, the researchers were able to assess the current system of each online food delivery company in this 
study. The researchers conducted a survey online with the use of a web-based survey tool (google form), and they 
were able to gather data from the respondents to get feedback on their food delivery experiences. The researchers were 
also able to assess their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and the process of how people order in the 
application. The most important factor in an online delivery, according to 54.5% of respondents, was delivery, while 
the least important factor, according to 75.5% of respondents, was the interface. The survey also shows that 66.5% of 
its respondents utilize multiple online food delivery applications. The researchers were also able to show the statistics 
of different online food delivery applications per factor. The assessment was made by discussing different categories 
per phase and factor. The researchers then gathered the data and used it in statistical analysis to interpret them. 
 
The researchers then used the output of phase 1 to conduct phase 2 of this study. For the second phase, the ANOVA 
and Tukey tests identified 17 factors with significant differences between the factors and concluded that GrabFood 
has the highest overall rating of 4.1 for visual appeal, method, and delivery. In addition, the application of Pearson 
correlation resulted in the identification of factors with high-intermediate to a strong significant relationship. 
Furthermore, regression determined 7 significant factors that affect the efficiency of the overall delivery. The R-sq 
indicates that 71.34% of the efficiency of online food deliveries is explained by the 7 significant factors. Each data 
obtained from phases 1 and 2 were then analyzed by the researchers to create a risk assessment that identified possible 
risks and has a contingency plan for each category and benchmarked to provide and show which is the best practice 
to do. Recommendations to improve the current system of each online food delivery company have been suggested.

Abstract 
 
Land Transportation Office (LTO) is the agency in the Philippines responsible for the issuance of licenses and permits. 
Queuing time has been a major issue faced by the agency for several years due to processes that were unnecessary 
that prolong the waiting time of a customer. The current queuing system implemented by the LTO, after numerous 
complaints, turns out to be ineffective and inefficient. This study aims to assess and modify the current queuing system 
implemented by the LTO for the renewal of license and to propose a simulated procedure as a conceptual 
implementation of the proposed queuing system. Lean Management was used to dissect the processes and to eliminate 
unnecessary steps in the current queuing system. The researchers applied both actual and optimized data in Monte 
Carlo Simulation to compare the current system from the proposed change. After comparing the results using paired 
t-test, the study concluded that there is a significant difference between the current queuing system and the proposed 
queuing system. Furthermore, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) Method helped the researchers compare the 
criteria that impact the system. The development of the website, removal of waste-considered processes, and 
substitution of value-added procedures from a no-value added steps helped reduce the time spent of a customer for 
the renewal of the license.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Study 
Products are either given to consumers in output in terms of goods that are tangible or services that are 
intangibles. In the sense of services, its characteristics, as being of high quality is difficult to evaluate. This is because 
services are delivered through decision-making procedures, and under public sectors such as government agencies, 
which are ruled over by strict laws and regulations (Ocampo et al., 2017). Likewise, government agency throughout 
history handles a major role in promoting the general welfare of a country. Government agencies are responsible for 
processing perhaps the most important and fragile documents, hence requiring enough and efficient ways of 
performing such duties. The development, which can be referred to as work quality is the key determinant in improving 
a public sector in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Quality customer service has become among the most pressing 
issues discussed and pursued in the public and corporate arena (Rashid, 2008). The speed of service, which is a major 
problem in the Philippine government, reflects how efficient the system is by which affects customer satisfaction.

1865",,"Stream Mapping, Lean Waste Management Baseline, Takt Time, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Analytical Hierarchy 
Process Method, it can be concluded that through the proposed queuing system, LTO’s services can still improve.  
With the lack of proper queuing system management, customers in LTO allot time more than the expected 
duration. This resembles the poor implementation of the management regarding the queuing system to the agency 
itself. Moreover, due to the unnecessary processes, they do not meet their daily quota per day and have the employees 
exceed their time spent in the workplace, and they are forced to perform multiple tasks at once. 
For the proposed change, the application form, submission of a medical certificate, selection of mode of 
payment, and scheduling can be done online. Centralization of the server along with a database will also be 
implemented to refrain from encoding the data repeatedly. However, clients are restricted from accessing the data 
gathered in the server. In addition, reminders will be included on the website so that the customers will be aware of 
the policies and restrictions before proceeding to the selected branch to avoid conflicts. With these processes, the 
customers will only have their photo, signature, and biometrics taking in the LTO branch and wait for their license 
cards to be processed.   
Based on the Value Stream Mapping and Lean Waste Management Baseline of both the current and proposed 
system, from a total process time of 211.22 seconds, there is an improvement of about 58% as it decreased to a total 
process time of only 88.82 seconds. From their daily quota of 200 customers despite not meeting it due to delays, Takt 
Time demonstrated that implementing the proposed system can cater to about 324 customers. Furthermore, a 52% 
improvement can be seen in the proposed change based on the simulated results in the MCS. From an average total 
time spent of a customer of 8008.2 seconds or 2.22 hours, the proposed changed lessened the average time spent of a 
customer to 4132.56 seconds or 1.15 hours. The comparison between the current and proposed queuing system through 
the AHP method also indicated that the performance of the modified system is proven to be more efficient and effective 
upon the consideration of the essential criteria (i.e., Time Spent for Completion of Requirements, Time Spent for 
Cashier, & Convenience: Time Spent in Queue) that measure how well a system is performing.  
According to Martin et al. (2015), batch processing influences system performance for which it can result in 
longer lines and can result to longer waiting time, while in a statement found in the study of Rehman (2014), online 
processing is a live processing, e.g., when a customer fills up some form. It is also processing right away and at the 
same time. On the other hand, branch processing will be processed after a couple of days. Another is that in online 
processing, errors in the form will be automatically detected unlike for branch processing, which will just be notified 
after it is printed. Comparing the two statements, the online process is much better than batch processing (Rehman, 
2014).

Abstract 
Upon the emergence of self-serving technology along with the on-going pandemic, this study used decision analysis 
with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) software Expert Choice 2000 to determine the influence of five criteria 
(convenience, accessibility, flexibility, reliability, and accuracy) to the customer satisfaction of fast food chain 
consumers, then used the data from the result to identify which of the two methods between Kiosk machines or 
traditional cashier counters is optimal to utilize when ordering at McDonald’s fast food chain. The researchers used 
data from a sample of 242 respondents from a digital survey containing questions regarding the service rendered by 
the food-chain, which was then analyzed using descriptive analysis. Results showed that by 54.6%, utilizing Kiosk 
machines provide a better service for the customer based on their overall perceived satisfaction. However, there are 
still different factors that are not included yet it could affect the result of the study. For improvement, the researchers 
suggest that other factors such as the size of manpower, larger work area and price of items be included in the factors 
that determines the overall perceived satisfaction of the customer.

1. Introduction 
Customer satisfaction comes hand-in-hand with the customer service as the feedback regarding customer satisfaction 
allows the industry to enhance the quality efficiently (Aftab & Sarwar, Huma, 2016). This is affected by various 
indicators and according to Berry, Carbone, and Haeckel (2002), there are three categories that can affect service 
experience of the customers; (1) Functional clues, which are the technical quality of the service; (2) mechanic clues, 
which refer to the service environments including facility layout, design and ambient factors; and finally, (3) humanic 
clues which are the behaviors of the employees (Berry et al., 2002, as cited in Wall & Berry, 2007). In this study, only 
functional clues will be analyzed since functional clues determine how services are delivered to the customers and the 
capability of service of the fast food industry to perform competently in terms of accuracy and dependability (Garg, 
2014). Functional clues involve the start of the process of ordering, which usually begins with the queuing line, 
transaction proper, and receiving the order itself. Since the fast food industry is defined as a “quick-service” type of 
service, the consumers have more expectations when it comes to their service speed where Dharmawirya, Oktadiana, 
and Adi (2012) stated that speed is the top one influencer as to why people choose fast food restaurants. Aside from 
the speed of transaction the industry offers, it is expected that with that characteristic comes with quality service that 
provides a transaction that is accurate to the customers’ needs.  
As to why the introduction of self-service technologies boomed due to its primary objective to improve the overall 
quality of the function clues. Self-service technologies have claimed to be a technological interface that allows 
customers to produce services without the involvement of a service employee (Meutner et al., 2000, p. 50). As the 
food service industry expands, technological advancements that enhances service operations have become quickly 
developed and adopted. According to Kimes (2008), self-serving technology has the capability to magnify the speed

expanded payment options and faster waiting lines along with transactions. This can further improve the perceived 
customer satisfaction when applied but should be used as a model for decision making only.

Abstract  
 
Fast food restaurant has become extremely popular in the modern age as it provides fast service when it comes to food 
without the customers to prepare their food. Then it was evolved into the digital era, where the fast-food brands started 
to develop ideas of having an online delivery system in which customers can order fast food without having to go to 
the actual restaurant. This research study used the analytical hierarchy process to compare the in-house online delivery 
system of the three fast-food chains, namely Jollibee, McDonald’s, and KFC based on the criterion. The criterion 
identified in this study is convenience, flexibility, accuracy, reliability, user-friendly, and quality. This study aims to 
distinguish which of the criteria is the most significant for customer satisfaction and which of the three fast-food chains 
is the most preferred. The findings of this study show that KFC is the most preferred fast-food chain, and the three 
most influential criterion is the convenience, accuracy, and quality. On the other hand, user-friendly and flexibility 
show to have the least significant factor.

1. Introduction 
Fast food industries in the Philippines have played a significant role as successful food industry, especially in Metro 
Manila. According to a study, the fast-food industry is efficient and quick service in association with quality services 
serves as a driver to the industry’s success (Chen K., 1996). In the Philippines, there are three dominating fast-food 
industries in the Metro, mainly Jollibee, McDonald's, and Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC). Jollibee is a popular local 
fast-food brand that originated in the country that has served the Filipinos for more than four decades of service. It 
became the largest food-chain branch in the Philippines, and it expanded into multiple branches outside the country. 
McDonald's Corporation arrived in 1981 in the Philippines that was able to have a steady growth industry in the 
Philippines, being an international brand known by all, its competitive advantage rivals dominating fast-food chains 
of a local. KFC reaches the Philippines in 1966, being a fast-food staple in the country, it has maintained a good 
business venture despite its longevity in the country’s top food industries. 
 
Most people tend to value their time and spend preparing or ordering food inside restaurants. Online delivery had been 
a blast in the food industry, especially to Fast-food chains. Most online delivery caters to business districts and even 
residential areas as well. This innovation in service helps the food industry to expand their reach to consumers since 
it gives a lot of options for consumers to buy their food products by providing them convenience. However, the in-
house online delivery system of different fast-food industries have different architectural interfaces that mostly rivals 
other online delivery systems of other fast-food chains. In this research, the researchers will evaluate the in-house 
online delivery systems of the top 3 fast-food chains in the Philippines by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP).

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
Based on the graphical results from expert's choice software, Jollibee and KFC resulted in a lower value than 
McDonald's in the convenience criteria. Improvements to be applied by updating their menu on their website and 
application from time to time to be more convenient to their customers and other customers. For the criteria of 
accuracy, McDonald's and Jollibee got a lower outcome than KFC. The items ordered should be checked if it is correct 
and complete before they send it out for delivery, to avoid complaint from the customers. On the other hand, Jollibee 
has the lowest rating on the quality criteria. Suggested improvement is to check if the food and drinks are in good 
condition before they deliver them, and the riders should avoid driving too fast to avoid damages to the products that 
they will deliver. In the reliability criteria, the three fast-food chains should improve their delivery time to avoid 
complaints from their customer about the late deliveries and quality of the products. For the user-friendly, the three 
fast-food chains have close outcomes with one another. The three fast-food chains should continue to improve the 
interface of their website and app to have better ratings. McDonald’s has the lowest rating among the three fast-food 
chains in the criteria of flexibility. It is suggested that McDonald’s should always check if all their payment method 
is working and inform their customers ahead of time if one of their payment methods is not working to avoid 
inconveniences. For the overall improvement, for the fast-food chain to improve their service, they should focus on 
the criterion that has the lowest rating because this can help them achieve their customer's satisfaction. This study can 
be used by the fast-food restaurant used in this study to know what area they may improve to satisfy their customers, 
encourage other people to buy their product, and choose their service. Another suggestion is to have a monthly survey 
from their customers to help the fast-food chain become better and provide services that their customers will be surely 
satisfied.   
 
5.4 Validation  
This study analyzed and interpreted the data gathered from the online survey that was distributed to 291 respondents. 
The result and findings that by the researchers are supported by other existing studies that also discussed the use of 
the analytical hierarchy process in the selection of criteria and preferred fast-food chains. The use of expert choice 
software was utilized to provide a more graphical and numerical result that will support the objectives of this study. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results and findings, it can be concluded that KFC was chosen as the topmost preferred fast-food chain 
by the respondents compared to McDonald's and Jollibee. The result obtained by KFC is at an average weight of 0.397 
compared to McDonald’s with 0.338 and Jollibee with the least rating of 0.265. The identified three most significant 
criteria are convenience with an average weight of 0.267, accuracy with 0.242, and quality with 0.143. On the contrary, 
user-friendliness and flexibility are the least significant criteria with an average of 0.123 and 0.097. Thus, customers

addition, to further improve the study, future researchers should increase the number of factors and respondents to 
have a greater outcome in the data gathered.

Abstract 
The Philippines was considered to be one of the first few countries who have started the use of mobile money or 
simply digital payments. The country had an inconsistent development as they were starting with the technological 
field, so the government partnered with its related sectors in order to fully facilitate and promote the use of digital 
payments. Adjusting to this type of payment system may be difficult from the start, but as progress and development 
continues, people were able to manage all challenges experienced, which resulted in the sudden increase of usage in 
digital payments such as GCash, Paymaya, and Debit Card applications as these were considered to be the payment 
options that are widely used in the country in completing any transaction. In this study, the researchers aim to 
investigate which of the three (3) payment options are considered to be the most beneficial in terms of the factors of 
aesthetics, benefits/rewards, ease of use, loading convenience, range of transactions, security, and service fees 
by conducting an online survey to GCash, Paymaya, and Debit Card users in order to measure their customer 
satisfaction with the applications. The gathered data was used in the application of the Analytical Hierarchy Process, 
by using the software Expert Choice. The criteria weights and local weights acquired in using the software were used 
in calculating the global weight for each of the payment options in order to identify which is the best option among the 
three. Through the analysis of the related literature and gathered data, under the criteria used by the researchers, the 
factor of security was highly prioritized and considered by its users. Aside from that, Paymaya obtained the highest 
number of global weight in the calculations, being the best and most beneficial mobile application as a payment 
option in completing transactions in the Philippines, considering all factors mentioned, most especially the factor of 
security.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The Philippines was among the first nations to spearhead digital payments with the launch of mobile money 
in 2001. As it slowly shifts to being completely digital, the use of electronic payments are constantly being used over 
the years since it started. Ever since, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has been aiming for a modernized retail 
payment system in the country and has partnered with the government and numerous members from the banking, 
retail, and regulatory sectors to facilitate digital payments. The reason being is that they recognized the

On the last table, it is shown that the most preferred e-payment option is Paymaya, followed by Gcash and 
debit cards. The information from the expert choice shows the current ranks of e-payment systems that give 
awareness to consumers who prefer transferring money online considering the security factor. On the top rank is 
Paymaya as it gives an outstanding service in means of online payment service and transferring money. 
Consumers also have excellent accessibility to these e-payment systems to do money transactions such as 
drawing money, account-to-account transferring of money, and paying bills via mobile wallets, debit cards, and other 
digital gateways. Paymaya is indeed designed to be user-friendly that even the smallest transactions choose to have it 
done through this. According to past researchers, charging debit and credit cards and e-money is uncommon because 
there are numerous premises that are made in all countries to provide service to people. Furthermore, other 
payment options also provide outstanding satisfactory service for the needs of the people. 
6. Conclusion
A major concern of a company when entering the market of e-commerce is choosing an e-payment system 
that works excellently with the way their business/companies runs that is both well-known and secured. This study 
surveyed major criteria and the e-payment systems' situation right now in the Philippines. The tool used in ranking 
the e-payment systems together with its given criteria was the AHP decision-making tool in which the results of this 
tool were extensively discussed. The findings of this study are both applicable to the researchers, future researchers, 
and business establishments that are planning to take on or revamp an e-payment system.
People create developments to make lives for everyone easier just like the e-payment system. This system 
was made and imposed so that people don't need to carry cash around, waiting in line to pay bills, and wait for their 
change. This development is exactly what people need being that digital technology is now part of everyone's daily 
life. By connecting their debit cards, mobile wallets, and other digital gateways to shopping accounts, consumers can 
now buy and pay for products online. However, under criteria from the seven (7) factors given by the researchers, 
respondents prioritize security when choosing a payment option. Results show that PayMaya was able to offer 
excellent service in all the criteria, most especially in terms of security. Overall, most respondents are satisfied with 
their chosen payment option, although some respondents are not pleased by their experience through the cashless 
system; but it varies on their preference in buying or their behavior.

Abstract  
 
The COVID-19 pandemic had generated issues to individuals worldwide and education was one of the 
factors that experienced a major downfall. People started to use web conferencing applications during this 
pandemic since face-to-face meetings and large gatherings are prohibited. Web conferencing software 
serves a huge factor in business, family, and especially education. The aim of the study is to determine 
which web conferencing or video telephony applications perform better based on data usage, size, user-
friendliness, compatibility, security and safety, features and functionality, reliability, service, and overall 
satisfaction. After generating the criteria, a total of 210 respondents participated in the online survey to 
determine the average rating per category based on their experience of using the application Google Meet, 
Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.  The tallied averages were used in the AHP on the Expert Choice software to 
determine the weight per criteria. The study result shows that the Google Meet performs better than other 
two web conferencing applications within the given criteria.

1. Introduction  
There are a lot of people using different web conferencing applications especially during this pandemic where having 
big meetings, gatherings is not allowed. Now that most people are just staying in our homes, web conferencing 
applications have been a huge factor for businesses, family, and especially education. With people learning through 
online classes, there are a lot of web conferencing applications that are being used by different schools. This paper 
focuses on comparing the three most used web conferencing applications which are Zoom, MS Teams, and Google 
Meet. Majority of the people who use web conferencing applications are workers and students. According to Charlotte 
Verbrugghe, since the coronavirus started to spread around the world, people are forced to stay in their houses and 
since a lot of things can be done digitally, people started using different web conferencing applications. It is important 
to look for the right video conferencing tool to fulfill the meeting’s needs (Verbrugghe, 2020).  
 
There have been a lot of changes in the different video conferencing applications in the past years. Video conferencing 
has been made easier by the creators of zoom, ms teams, and google meet. The study aims to help people be aware of 
the different factors when it comes to choosing the right web conferencing application for different meetings, 
especially since online classes and work from home has been the new normal. This study will serve as reference for 
future use in determining which is the better web conferencing application when it comes to different factors such as 
features, security, availability, etc. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
The main objective of the study is to determine which communication software or application performs better in terms 
of the criteria utilized in the decision analysis. The specific objectives of the study are described as: (1) to determine 
factors that affects the performance of communication software or application used by students for online learning,

satisfaction, Google meet placed first with a rating of 0.528, second is Zoom with a rating of 0.333, and MS teams in 
last place with a rating of 0.140. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The researchers think that the companies holding these applications should focus more on improving the different 
factors that can make video conferencing more convenient to the users. Companies should add more features, and add 
more security for the user’s needs. They should also take care of their customers and address their concerns as fast as 
possible, since video conferencing applications are a trend during this pandemic. Conducting surveys about the user’s 
experience in order for them to determine which factors the web application is lacking. 
 
5.4 Validation  
In this study, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), it shows the result of what is the best alternative for 
the web conferencing application. As shown from the data, the first head to head comparison between Zoom Meetings 
and MS Teams shows that from the 9 criteria, Zoom Meetings is the best alternative based on the criteria and MS 
Teams only stands out from its security and safety. As for the second head to head comparison between Zoom 
Meetings and Google Meet. Zoom Meetings is only the best alternative when it comes to Data Usage, Features and 
Functionality, and its size, so based from the second head to head comparison, Google Meet is the best alternative. 
Lastly, the third head to head comparison between Google Meet and MS Teams. It is clearly shown from the results 
of the data that Google Meet has the best alternative when it comes to all of its criteria. In addition, Google Meet has 
the highest ranking among the three head to head comparison. In all of the alternatives from the data, it is shown that 
all of its criteria has all the customer needs, but when it comes to satisfying the customer needs it is clearly shown that 
Google Meet can give all of its satisfaction for the customer needs.   
 
6. Conclusion  
In this study, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) data. It shows that it has about 9 criteria and resulted 
into 3 alternatives. In this method, we asked the respondents to evaluate the three web conferencing applications based 
on the criteria that we have shown, and determine what is the best alternative among the three. As shown from the 
data, we have been able to determine the best web conferencing applications from the results of the evaluation of the 
respondents, Google Meet is the web conferencing application that has the high ranking value among the three. In 
addition, Google Meet did not only have the highest ranking but its customer satisfaction has met all the criteria that 
is all needed by a customer.

Abstract 
The Internet Service Provider (ISP) is responsible for providing internet connection and services to individual 
and company/organizations. Nowadays, Internet service providers are growing rapidly with different advantages and 
disadvantages. Therefore, there are several standards that can be used to determine which internet service providers 
are the most appropriate for use. In this study, several internet providers were listed by the author such as PLDT, 
Globe and Converge. The Method that was used is AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method. This method was 
used to determine which internet providers satisfied the respondents. With this method, Respondents are guided to 
make their decision in answering the survey with 8 criteria: Quality, Speed, Monthly Charges, Consistency, Latency 
(Ping), Contents, Customer Service and Overall user satisfaction. While for Alternatives; PLDT, Globe and Converge.

1. Introduction 
The Internet made its way in the Philippines on March 29, 1994 with the Philippines Network Foundation 
(PHNet). According to Data Reportal, the average daily time Filipinos spent in using the internet was approximately 
10.6 hours. And as of January 2021, there were 73.91 million internet users in the country, penetrating 67% in the 
population of the Philippines. 
The Internet Service Provider (ISP) is responsible for providing internet connection and services to individual 
and company/organizations. The internet has been considered as a fast-growing technology hence, from 400 million 
users in 2000, it increases to over 3.4 billion users in 2016 globally (Roser, et.al., 2015). Internet is a technology used 
to communicate in distance worldwide by means of interactive tools such as emails, SMS, and other websites made 
to communicate. It also provides advantages in unlimited search of information freely accessible by anyone. The 
internet has become the mainstream and has been an essential to many households especially in the rise of innovation 
and technology. It became an access to knowledge and data for students, employees, and other workers particularly 
those who work in an office field. 
Internet providers in the country now offer more options to be more convenient and can easily be accessible in 
providing internet. They offer plans such as Wi-Fi, 4G and as of now 5G is accessible via these internet providers. 
There are different types of ISPs namely: 
• 
High internet speed or Cable internet - This type of connection interconnects with cables. This is often offered 
by cable companies 
• 
Satellite internet - A type of connection which does not rely on wires or cables. Satellites receive and send 
back data to its destination. This is mostly available in rural areas.

1919","among the three alternatives. To add, Globe has the highest ranking among the three alternatives such that it is 
consistent when it comes to its consistency when it comes to stability of the internet. All the three alternatives gave 
all the customers’ needs but Globe’s Customer service has the highest ranking among the three and it simply showed 
that Globe can give all the service that they can to satisfy their customers. Lastly, all the Internet service providers 
satisfy all their customer’s needs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method's definition and arrangement of criteria and 
alternatives, it formed 8 criteria and 3 alternatives. Through this method, respondents were asked through a Survey 
Questionnaire to rate the criteria and to determine which alternative or Internet Service Provider they use so that the 
researchers will be able to calculate which one has the priority value. To determine which is the best Internet Service 
Provider that can be used is derived from using the AHP process and calculations using the computer software package 
Expert Choice is used to validate respondent consistency for a particular level of the hierarchy. 
 
Based on the outcome, the best alternative is the Internet Service Provider: Globe. The calculated results 
show significant differences per alternative within each criterion. For Quality, all the given alternatives were equal 
with little to no difference. For Internet Speed, Globe and Converge are tied in the lead while PLDT had the least 
rating. In terms of Monthly Charges, PLDT and Globe shared the same rating leaving converge with lesser score. For 
Consistency, Globe had higher rating consistency among the three with Converge in second and PLDT at third. With 
regards to Latency, PLDT had the highest rating making Globe second and Converge third. For Contents, PLDT had 
the higher rating with Globe and Converge tie results. Customer Service shows that Globe had more score than the 
other two, making PLDT second and Converge third. Lastly, all three alternatives were at tie for the Overall User 
Experience Satisfaction. Overall, Globe had the most rating among the other alternatives with PLDT in second and 
Converge at third.

Abstract  
 
This research aims to assess the different criteria on using the chosen same day delivery couriers namely Grab 
Delivery, Lalamove, and Angkas. The research itself aims to help consumers availing the service identify which 
one is best from the identified criteria. This research will also help to identify the areas they would need to 
improve by considering the criteria that were rated by the customers. By maximizing the use of Analytical 
Hierarchical Process (AHP), the research aims to determine the best same-day delivery courier by evaluating 
them and doing pairwise comparisons for each criterion . The research made use of a survey questionnaire to 
get customers satisfaction for delivery time, Rider’s Behavior and Attitude, Aesthetics, Fees and Charges, 
Limitations, and Delivery Accuracy. AHP resulted in Grab being the ideal courier, Lalamove as the alternative 
courier, and Angkas as being the lowest voted courier.

Introduction 
1.1. 
Objective 
 
The study implores two aspects for its objectives. It tackles both general and specific aims in the result of the 
study. While its general aspects seek towards correlating satisfaction among customers towards the delivery 
services brought by the selected delivery companies, it also specifies and obtains results as it compares the 
factors for satisfaction (Delivery time, Rider’s Behaviour and Attitude, Fees and Charges, Limitations, 
Aesthetics, Responsiveness and Delivery Accuracy) with the performance made by delivery services 
Lalamove, Angkas and Grab Philippines. Furthermore, this shall serve as a future reference and criteria for 
future company improvements or studies.

Literature Review 
2.1 Same Day Delivery Courier Services 
Supported by Dones & Young (2020), demand is always followed by the supply. This has been proven towards 
the necessities brought by the pandemic. In their recent article featuring the urgency of the new normal’s 
delivery courier services, various establishments have vied for their own edge in a fast-rising business sector 
in the Philippines.  
Establishments such as J&T Express offer a cunning edge in fast yet reliable deliveries, with a 24/7 customer 
service, and an all-year round operation. Not only that, but they also market their service with a real-time

1932","Since the p-value in the Table 5.4.7 is greater than 0.05 and the F-statistic value is less than the F-crit thus, we 
can conclude that there is no significant difference among the three selected couriers within the given criterion. 
 
6. 
Conclusion 
The purpose of this research was to assess courier services between Lalamove, Angkas Padala, and 
Grab Delivery and its implications to customer satisfaction by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) 
within an event of Covid-19 Pandemic. Based on the analysis conveyed, it can be concluded that the objectives 
of this research is successfully met as one of the objectives is that the research correlates satisfaction among 
customers towards the delivery services brought by the selected delivery companies and the other objective is 
to specify and to obtain results as it compares the factors (Delivery time, Rider’s Behaviour and Attitude, Fees 
and Charges, Limitations, Aesthetics, Responsiveness and Delivery Accuracy) for satisfaction with the 
performance made by the selected courier service. The researchers used an application called Expert Choice 
where it is a decision-making software that is based on multi-criteria decision making and the software uses 
the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) which is the primary method to be used in the research. It is shown in 
the validation that the analysis is verified and comes with an analysis of variance that shows the significant 
difference between the selected courier service. Analysis of variance is commonly used to analyze the 
difference between selected variables of its mean. It also shows that the data gathered within this research can 
be analyzed with the analysis of variance as the calculated data comes with a mean that can justify the difference 
between the selected courier services.  There are numerous researches about the comparison of the selected 
courier service and the difference of this research from the rest is the method used in this research is Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) which compared to descriptive and statistical analysis that are commonly used with 
this type of research.

Abstract 
 
Throughout the years, different mobile phones have improved in terms of quality and design which are still being 
developed continuously. It is known that the mobile operating system is responsible for the overall performance of a 
particular mobile phone. This study aims to know the user preference when it comes to the mobile operating system 
of different mobile phone designs in the current market today namely, the iOS, Android, and Huawei’s HarmonyOS. 
This study uses an Analytic Hierarchy Process with the help of a software called Expert Choice in evaluating the final 
conclusions. A survey questionnaire with different criteria was constructed for the data needed in this study. The 
criteria used for this study were Interface, Customization, Reasonability, Storage, Battery, Camera, and Overall User 
Experience. Among the 7 criteria, Reasonability showed the highest weight with an equivalent value of 0.354. After 
conducting all the tests and using pairwise numerical comparisons and graphs of the different operating systems, 
Android was identified to have the highest score with a value of 0.443. These data gathered will be of help for users 
in determining the most preferred mobile phone operating system.

Abstract 
 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting life all over the world with an increasing number of infected 
individuals and fatality. Certain individuals are at a higher risk for severe illness if they become infected. This study 
aims to identify the risk of progression of COVID-19 symptoms for patients with underlying diseases residing in the 
National Capital Region, Philippines. The longer the patient stays in the hospital, the higher the risk that the 
symptoms will progress from mild to severe illness. Descriptive statistics were used to categorize quantitative data, 
Correlation to identify significant relationships between variables, ANOVA to determine the significant difference 
among all the factors, a Tukey test was conducted to identify which of the specific pairs are statistically 
significant, and multiple linear regression to obtain significant factors that could affect the number of days that a 
patient with underlying diseases experiences mild to severe symptoms, as well as the number of days that a patient 
with severe symptoms to be transferred to the medical ward. Lastly, Risk assessment with the use of Kepner Tregoe 
(KT) Analysis was utilized. Findings reveal that factors age, blood type group, gender, vitamin intake, sleeping hours, 
and smoking have a significant difference between the duration of Mild and Severe infection. The length of having 
symptoms is directly proportional to the whole duration of the infection.   Furthermore, Comorbidity Cancer with 
Chronic Kidney Disease and Type II Diabetes has the longest duration of severe infection among all the underlying 
disease and comorbidity.

1. Introduction 
Health is the state of a human’s body and the extent to which it is illness-free or could be able to resist an illness. 
Collins dictionary (n.d) Investing in healthcare is an important priority to the community especially to each of the 
individuals. The Coronavirus (COVID-19) was first reported as a mystery illness that no one knows where it came 
from and the next thing we knew, it has already spread around the world. The outbreak started with the increasing 
number of pneumonia that originated from Wuhan China around December 2019. A 38-year-old woman who arrived 
from Wuhan China was the first case of Covid-19 in the Philippines and it was confirmed last January 30, 2020. 
Dancel, R. (2020). A person who develops Covid-19 starts noticing the symptoms like Fever, Dry Cough, Fatigue, 
Loss of taste or smell, Sore Throat, Headache, Diarrhea, Nasal Congestion within 2 to 14 days after being exposed 
to the novel coronavirus. The study according to Zaki, N. (2020), tackled that the severity of COVID-19 illness with 
people who have diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, cancer, stroke, and high cholesterol should be carefully 
interpreted because there is a lot of factors that can be associated with the COVID-19 patient, including their age, 
history of smoking or other clinical conditions. It was found through the disease variables, evidenced by the increased 
risk of COVID-19 severity including the following: hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol level imbalance. 
 
The overall case-fatality rate (CFR) in China was raised for patients with comorbidities, 10.5% with cardiovascular 
disease, 7.3% with diabetes, 6.3% with chronic respiratory disease, and 5.6% with cancer dying of COVID-related 
illness. Wu, Z. (2020). The possible significant variables that could affect the patients such as the number of days 
that would take a patient with mild symptoms reaching the severe level, as well as the number that takes for the 
patient with severe symptoms to be transferred in the medical ward until its recovery will also be a part of this

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this research supports Bennett K. (2021) study entitled Underlying conditions and risk of 
hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among those with COVID-19 in Ireland: A national surveillance study. 
However, it is in the Philippines settings. The researchers assessed the medical condition by gathering the records of 
patients with the underlying disease to identify the risk of progression of COVID-19 symptoms. The study 
concentrated on the living patients that experienced symptoms from mild to severe residing in the National Capital 
Region without age limit. The survey determined the respondent’s demographics, underlying diseases, lifestyle, and 
symptoms. 
 
The researchers gathered a total of 212 individuals consisting of 87 females and 125 males. 25.00% of the 
respondents live in Quezon City which was the highest count in the survey. Most of the respondents are coming from 
the age group of 50 – 59 years old, blood type A, with a BMI of 18.5 – 25, and coming from the family with 23,381 
– 46,760 and 46,761 - 81,831 income. 
 
It was found that demographics factors - age, blood type group, and gender have a significant difference between the 
mild and severe duration. For the lifestyle factors, vitamin intake, average hours of sleep, and vices have significant 
differences also between the mild and severe duration. For the symptoms, fever, dry cough, tiredness, aches & pain, 
sore throat, and headache have significant differences between the whole infected duration. And lastly, there is also 
a significant difference between Underlying disease, Comorbidities, and Severe Duration. Patients with Cancer, 
Chronic Kidney, and Diabetes comorbidities have the highest mean among all the underlying diseases and 
comorbidity. The results obtained explain that people who have Comorbidity of Cancer with Chronic Kidney 
Disease, and Type II Diabetes experience a longer duration of severe infection among all the Underlying disease and 
Comorbidity. 
 
It is concluded that there is a significant difference but low weak negative correlation between mild and severe 
duration which means that there are instances that a patient with mild symptoms has a longer number of days 
experiencing the infection and only experienced severe symptoms for a shorter duration or vice versa. 
 
The researchers established three separate regression analyses. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to 
determine the most common significant factors with the most significant role in increasing the risk of acquiring 
the COVID-19 virus which is the smoker and non-smoker that became significant to all of the dependent variables. 
Disinfection of Gadget and Vitamin Intake resulted to be the significant factors for Mild and Severe Duration. Family 
Average Income and number of comorbidity resulted to be the significant factors for Severe and Whole Duration. 
 
The researchers created a risk assessment with the use of Kepner Tregoe (KT) Analysis to conclude certain 
evaluations and contingency plans to avoid the chances of being infected. The researchers advised practicing 
preventive actions such as staying at home, avoiding unnecessary travel, staying away from large groups of people 
or people with symptoms, and wearing personal protective equipment inside and outside the area. Awareness and 
reminder to people on how to disinfect properly, how to take care of themselves, and ways to boost their immune 
system. And if the person starts to experience the symptoms the contingency plan is to isolate themselves from the 
other people and seek immediate medical attention. Get rest and drink plenty of liquid to avoid being dehydrated. 
Information that will be gathered in future references may expand this study and upsurge the knowledge of COVID-
19 Symptoms for Patients with Underlying Diseases. Future researchers recommend gathering a wider sample size 
to produce more accurate data and to conduct the study outside NCR, to have more respondents. Also, adding 
more factors must be considered to have more variables for example are vices, other symptoms, and other kinds 
of underlying disease. The researchers recommend that the people who have fully recovered from the virus consider 
donating plasma since it contains high antibody levels that may reduce the severity and duration of COVID-19. 
Convalescent plasma is a therapy that uses blood from people who have recovered from an illness to help others. In 
addition, the national government and Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) should develop a long-term solution that can 
immediately prevent the active cases from getting higher. As this study is a continuous work, it may support the 
progress of preventive and clinical interventions leading to reduced severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients with 
underlying conditions. This study will be a help to the medical staff and patients to identify significant factors that 
affect the patients’ vulnerability in COVID-19.

Abstract  
  
This research study aims to assess the different factors of using the 3 different applications (Grabfood, FoodPanda and 
Pick.A.Roo) to help the consumers to be aware of using it. By comparing the data from each criteria, the delivery 
companies could also improve their services for better experience. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was utilized 
in order to determine the weights and decision of each factor to the study. The data was gathered through google forms 
survey questionnaires. Based on the computed weighted alternatives, FoodPanda is considered as the top alternative, 
Pick.A.Roo as the next one and Grabfood at the last.  In terms of high weighted factors, mostly the FoodPanda has the 
highest value per criteria compared to the other applications. The data showed that people are usually looking at the 
delivery time, security and safety, and availability of food and restaurant choices of the food delivery applications.

1. Introduction  
 Nowadays, technology has been widely booming and even the oldest generations have been adapting to the new norm. 
For some people, it is something that is not quite interesting and somewhat distracting. And the latter would technically 
be entertained and pleased by what the contemporary world has to offer. Technology can sometimes be either irrational 
or immoderate, with its peculiar and odd innovations, it can be unreliable and skeptical. Most of the time, technology 
users have been quite addicted or restrained from the unfathomable reasons of usage of technology such as mobile 
phones, tablets, computers and the like. What makes it appalling is the fact that it is not noticeable which makes 
technology somewhat questionable. It clings to an individual that it worsens one’s point of view of reality. Isolation 
among different humans, less interactions, inability to see what’s beyond the screen. On the other hand, it does not 
particularly focus on the disadvantages of technology but has beneficial aspects too.  
  
Technology was able to develop for years and it has finally come to a point where the unthinkable has already existed. 
Robots, electric vehicles, 3D printing, e-cigarettes, gene editing, digital assistants, and more. During its early years, 
technology was being utilized by humans for communication, data recordings and retrieval of past data, cloud 
computing, internet and search, analytics, immersive and augmented-reality, and automation. But now, technology has 
become more riveting that humans are able to stay at home and not take the extra mile to commute all the way to their 
desired restaurant with the use of food delivery applications such as Grabfood, Foodpanda, and Pick.A.Roo. These are 
three known online food delivery (OFD) applications that are based in the Philippines and other applications are 
globally known as well. They offer various foods that are located around your area either local restaurants or 
international. The most common reason for consumers having much of their attention to OFD is because of its 
convenience. Another would be that it seems to be a need for fast and easy meals during or after a long day at work. 
The numerous food delivery systems that are readily accessible relieve customers of the burden of thinking about and 
planning meals, whether the customer is cooking the meal himself, eating in at a restaurant, or heading to a restaurant 
and purchasing food to carry back to the workplace or home. (Lau, et al., 2019). Since the Philippines still has its 
ongoing quarantine lockdown, Filipinos are forced to stay at home and not have the opportunity to leave their homes

1969",,"to be FoodPanda, Pick.A.Roo comes second, and third comes GrabFood. FoodPanda has already met all customer’s 
wants to experience a satisfying moment with this OFD application. However, there was three main criterions that 
made FoodPanda come at second and third. Security and safety, accuracy of orders, and customer service. This is due 
to the fact that Pick.A.Roo is known to be a premium application and they provide systems that makes all information 
in tacked together without any leaks. There were instances wherein FoodPanda does not deliver the goods in a certain 
destination with complete orders. Some would be disappointed with the fact that customers already placed remarks 
about adding extra condiments, but the delivery man was not able to see nor do this. Customer service was voted last 
under FoodPanda, perhaps this might be the reason of having slow replies towards customer and does not meet their 
satisfaction. This time, GrabFood runs first for customer services, which means that they provide all the necessary 
information and was able to approach customers in a speedy manner. The heaviest weighing factor for the criterion 
amongst the three are delivery time, second comes the security and privacy of one’s personal information revolving 
around the OFD application, and third comes the availability of food and restaurant choices. Perhaps the reason for 
having the heaviest weighing factor for delivery time is the traffic congestion in the Philippines.  
 
Business World, Balinbin (2021) reports that Manila's traffic congestion dropped drastically because of the COVID19 
quarantine yet according to a position technology business, Manila remains the fourth-most congested city in the 
world. Consumers highly depend on these OFD applications to be delivered at their doorstep as fast as these delivery 
drivers could, to feed hungry consumers. But with the traffic congestion in the Philippines consumer’s satisfaction 
highly becomes affected towards consumer’s satisfaction. Next, privacy and security, almost all the citizens of the 
Philippines know the danger of E-commerce especially when it comes to payment information and personal 
information in various online shopping applications as well as OFD applications. In today's situation, customers must 
be mindful of theft, cheating, and stolen card identities, as well as low quality products and services.

1 Introduction 
The progress of modern technology is developing the way we work, play, create, and communicate.  With this 
advancement, it also helps in creating new educational opportunities in the digital world.  Higher institutions consider 
changing their conventional way of teaching to online based as it allows their students to finish their education 
anywhere in the world without having any interference in their academic journey (Reid, 2019). Administering a well-
run flow of knowledge in an academic institution is one of the many ways to improve academic standards and 
guarantee quality.  With the rising of education technology, access to information and communication have been made 
easier and trouble-free. Through modern technology and the internet, information circulates fast across the globe 
which makes the Learning Management System (LMS) an essential instrument for students in order to stay updated 
with their daily school activities (Adzharuddi & Ling, 2013).  LMS uses technology to offer learning materials for 
students in any location.  Overall, the concept of LMS can be arranged in relationship to e-learning, technocentric (use 
of mobile devices in education), providing formal education (face-to-face learning), and centered on the students’ 
perspectives (Derakhshan, 2012). LMS is correlated with communication technology, therefore it is device-dependent 
(Gong & Wallace, 2012).  
 
1.1 
Objectives 
Although numerous research have been conducted to examine the usability and user interface of Blackboard Learn, it 
is important to address that most of the previous studies focused more on the website application using a desktop 
rather than the mobile application using mobile devices. In this paper, the researchers will address and provide a 
comparison of the usability of Cardinal EDGE using different gadgets such as laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. An 
analysis of the effectivity of Cardinal EDGE features in terms of User Interface, Flexibility, Design and Layout, 
Learnability and User Satisfaction will be conducted. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness 
and usability of different technological devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. Moreover, the authors 
also aim to identify the significant factors affecting the students’ satisfaction.

1981",,"The study revealed that considering all the evaluating factors, the Tablet has been identified as the most usable device 
in accessing Cardinal EDGE. The next most effective device is the mobile followed by the laptop preferred device for 
Cardinal EDGE. 
It is a surprising result since it is automatically assumed that the Laptop will get the best score among the three 
alternatives. But clearly, in the results, the Tablet is the best device to use mainly due to its high scores in terms of 
Flexibility and Learnability. 
The case is the same for the Mobile, giving it a rank of second place. 
Surprisingly, the Laptop placed last according to the results obtained. Although the Laptop has been consistently high 
in the User Interface and User Satisfaction, it has very low scores in the Learnability, Design and Layout, and 
Flexibility. With most Tablets nowadays having similar capabilities with a Laptop, the Flexibility of the Tablet gives 
it a higher rank than the Laptop.

Abstract  
 
For decades, the Philippines have been benefiting from brick-and-mortar shops but have altered dramatically after the 
COVID-19 pandemic. As the globe transitions to a new normal, this study aims to determine the factors that influence 
e-Shopping and online shopping. Specifically, it investigates the buyers’ characteristics in relation to their shopping 
preferences by utilizing the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. A total of 277 Filipinos answered the 
survey questionnaire, which contained 39 questions. The results of SEM indicated that buyers’ characteristics have a 
mediating effect on influence factors – environment, which identified that customers’ features include status shoppers, 
brand conscious, and recreational shoppers. Customers’ primary concern in online shopping is payment security and 
privacy, while others prefer to buy products online due to accessibility and convenience. Some brand conscious 
customers consider physical contact with products in shopping. On the other hand, the result also showed that influence 
factors – product and influence factors – environment have no significant direct effect on customer shopping 
preference. But customers find that orders are easy to place, 24 hours accessibility and several payment options are 
advantages in an online shopping interface. In contrast, the ability to touch the product, immediate availability of the 
product, and sales assistance are the advantages of in-store shopping.

1. Introduction 
 
While businesses were shuttered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people of all ages seem to gravitate toward online 
shopping in large numbers and with increasing frequency. IBM's US Retail index reported a 75% drop in a department 
store and other ""non-essential"" retailer sales in the second quarter. Adoption by previously uninitiated users has 
skyrocketed, particularly in under-penetrated categories such as grocery. Consumers' adoption of omnichannel 
services, particularly for social commerce, has expanded over this period. Indeed, Oullette (2021) forecasts that 
internet shoppers in the United States alone would reach 300 million by 2023. 
 
Filipinos are among the world's most avid internet users, logging on for an average of ten hours daily. This is one of 
the reasons why the Philippines had seen the biggest growth in shopping applications in Southeast Asia, with a 53 
percent increase during the epidemic. Caña (2020) said that the country's shopping applications accounted for a total 
of 4.9 billion sessions. In general, the Philippines saw the greatest increase in online spending this year compared to 
the first half of 2019. This trend in online shopping may catalyze future consumer preference studies. While online 
and in-store shopping appears to be comparable, there may be significant distinctions (Browne, Durrett & Wetherbe, 
2004). For example, online consumers are, by definition, isolated from the store's physical location, imposing intrinsic 
limits on the buying experience, such as the inability to grasp a product and examine its characteristics attentively. 
What the online shopping experience lacks in tactile information, it compensates for with clearly presented product 
details; products online are marked with often overwhelming amounts of information, which influences the overall 
shopping experience of consumers (Kim & Lennon, 2000). Consumers spend a few hours comparing prices and then 
complete the purchasing process in-store. Thus, the time and energy spent acquiring information are not reduced in 
the online context in comparison to the in-store setting.

Abstract 
 
Public transportation provides a cost-effective commute for people to reach their destination. In the Philippines, it is 
dominated by road vehicles such as jeepneys, taxicabs, Asian utility vehicles, and tricycles, with most if not all, 
commuters go via multiple carriers for the daily routine. The highly contagious coronavirus has put the world on high 
alert when it comes to touching high contact public surfaces. When it comes to paying for public transport services by 
cash, contact is inevitably unavoidable. Recent studies have concluded that the coronavirus can persist on inanimate 
surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 3 days depending on the conditions. Interest would be on how drivers 
and passengers can be protected in the age of coronavirus and beyond. With the growing concern over the safety of 
drivers and commuters, it would be much advisable to use contactless payments to reduce the risk of transmission. 
With no obvious end to the outbreak in sight, the study delved on the feasibility of applying the cashless payment 
system for the multi-carrier commuting public. Results provided a better understanding of the complexities, issues, 
requisites and benefits of a Multi-Carrier Contactless Payment System for public transportation and all its 
stakeholders.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Background of Study 
 
Transportation is a process of transferring people or goods from one point to another by which such movement is 
required as it provides accessibility, improves business activities of goods and services (The Editors of Encyclopedia 
Britannica, n.d.). Metro Manila occupies a total land area of 620 km² and supports 12 to 15 million due to the 
movements of nearby provinces as of the year 2012 (Varsolo Sunio, 2017). The mobility does have a transportation 
mix from private vehicles to public vehicles such as buses, taxis, and the commonly used and locally know Filipino 
vehicles or an Asian Utility vehicle that are jeeps or jeepneys and tricycles (Boquet, 2017). The Philippines received 
a big dent in its economy due to the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. All modes of transportation halted, people were 
not able to move from one place to another, jobs were stopped, and the way how people work changed. Transportation 
of people and goods was radically reduced, supply chains were disrupted, businesses closed, the stock market 
collapsed, and unemployment soared; exponentially growing the worldwide economic crisis. (Capra, 2020) 
 
Due to the pandemic, the use of the cashless system is inevitable, a solution made to reduce and minimize direct 
physical contact between people in avoiding the rapid spread of the virus. DOTr mentioned that they will be of utilizing 
a system called Automatic Fare Collection System (AFCS) along with the electronic toll collection. For those 
passengers who are not fortunate in applying the AFCS, they are required to pay the driver in cash before boarding.

2004","These failure points are the processes where there could be some possible errors where the system might fail and does 
not work therefore a solution must be created through the use of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA). 
 
With the use of the current technology like the internet it provides us ease of use especially when mobile banking is 
available and does provide similar ways to create cashless methods. By integrating this method on the multi-carrier 
payment system within the PUVs a system that lessen transmission due to the pandemic and will the future of 
contactless payment while using public transport. 
 
5. CONCLUSION 
 
In conclusion, the results on our objective show that there's an area of improvement with the effort of creating a 
contactless payment as shown on the service blueprint. With this approach, the application of the multi-carrier 
payment system in the new normal will significantly decrease the risk of the commuting public being infected by the 
covid-19 virus. As the researchers conducted surveys, it provides us a clear view that some people are willing to take 
the said app. With this type of payment system, passengers will have peace of mind when it comes to safety. The use 
of a contactless payment system via the mobile platform to book or have a ride will give more convenience to the 
commuting public especially in metro manila PUVs. The fast, ease, and reliability of transactions between the operator 
of PUVs and passengers will be flawless and worry-free this is also to be protected by each party on the uprising of 
the virus. This is also the next step to be the new normal on our local PUV system as we uncover new ways in the 
contactless payment system.

Abstract  
 
Bread is part of the staple diet to many people around the world and commercial plant bakeries are amongst the 
key players in the bread market. Amongst the key concerns of commercial plant bakeries is sustainability.  This 
paper focuses on bread returns. Bread returns and associated activities contribute to the costs of operating a 
commercial plant bakery and can impact on sustainability objectives or the lack thereof. Through a case study of 
three selected commercial plant bakeries in South Africa, this paper identifies the activities involved in the 
handling of returns as a means of exploring sustainable practices. The research methodology adopted in this paper 
uses literature review in combination with primary data collected from the selected commercial plant bakeries. 
The primary data is from interviews and questionnaire survey. Findings indicate that participating bakeries 
considered bread returns very significant and material given the characteristics of the industry. They are of the 
view that bread returns including associated waste is a current concern. The bread returns process flow observed 
in this study, in relation to reverse logistics, bears some similarities with those previously identified for the 
Swedish bread industry. Key improvement areas were highlighted including take-back clause and agreement in 
the context of producer/suppler retailer interface, Route-to-market (Sales Channels) contributions to total bread 
returns, handling and the disposal of bread waste arising from returns, and oversight role in bread returns 
management.

1. Introduction  
Manufacturing businesses engage in the process of converting inputs into value-added outputs. Like typical 
manufacturing businesses, bread producers are also involved in the transformation of raw materials into finished 
products and one way or the other are increasingly required to meet sustainability objectives from economic, 
environmental  and social perspectives. For plant bakeries, the basic business principles of seeking and realising 
value through selling a product(s) at a price point above the cost invested in creating it is fundamental. The 
standard-bread producing industry is a high-volume low-margins type of a business, characterised by ever-
fluctuating input costs in the form of raw materials such as wheaten flour, energy, distribution costs, among other 
notables.  Competitively managing sales value and efficiently containing overall costs is one of the cornerstones 
of commercial plant bakeries looking to meet its sustainability objectives.  A complication for commercial plant 
bakeries is the product itself; it is perishable and has relatively limited shelf life. It is not uncommon to see 
commercial plant bakeries grapple with the issue of bread returns and losses. Brancoli et al. (2019) deduced that 
bakeries and retailers’ value-chain contributed a loss rate of 80 410 tons of bread per annum. Lebersorger and 
Schneider (2014) evaluated that individual retail outlets may return between 0% and 53% of unsold bread & pastry 
to bakers. Eriksson et al. (2017) highlighted that of 2.5 million loaves delivered between years 2011 to 2015 to

2016","Summarily, different sales channels contribute to total returns at various degrees, some level of similarities in 
channel contributions were identifiable. Arguably, from observation, a combination of factors such as the trading 
terms (at supplier retail interface), and trade volumes that passing through a specific sales channel has a direct 
effect on the ranking considerations as shown on Table 3. 
 
Table 4 Ranking of Sales Channels in relation to contributions to total bread returns 
 
 
Respondent from Bakery A  sees  using the services of a Waste Management Company as the most appropriate 
way of managing bread disposal/waste citing security benefits .Bakery A respondent expressed reliance on the 
demand created by farmers as the most sustainable and appropriate way. For the general understanding of what 
sustainability is, Bakery A respondents gave a divergent opinion, chose to relate it to an unavoidable consequence 
of trade and respondents from Bakery B chose not to answer at all. 
 
Key highlights from the case studies indicate that producers/suppliers distribute bread to the market and the very 
bread returns to the producer/supplier as takebacks. The market is composed of different channels that include 
formal trade, informal trade, independent distributors, and depots including contracted waste disposal 
management companies. The process flow diagrams developed from plant observations in this research contrast 
to the reverse supply chain diagram from literature though some similarities exist. One interesting observation is 
that returns in Bakery A are under the oversight role of the sales department rather than the usual Distribution 
Manager or the distribution department as in Bakery B. From a business perspective, arguably, it makes more 
sense for the sales department to have full responsibility in the handling and management of bread returns given 
the characteristics of a baking business of high-volume low margin. Another interesting observation is in the 
handling and disposal of waste, returned non-saleable bread is disposed as waste however, Bakery A send all its 
waste to a compacter located at site and eventually is sold to and collected by a recycling company. Bakery B 
sells waste directly to Pig Farmers who will collect it on demand, if no demand for waste exists; it is disposed via 
a waste management company at a cost to Bakery B. Having a bread compactor improves on hygiene associated 
with the handling of waste, importantly gives a bakery the impetus to sell its waste thus recovering some value.  
There are scope for increased performance in the management of bread returns and this may be achieved in various 
ways for example optimising the bread returns process, adopting improved process maps, innovating the returns 
disposal methods. There are also tax implications. In this regard, it can be recommended that bread 
producers/suppliers may be able to leverage on tax incentives that comes through corporate donation. A good case 
law is of Lucky Stores vs Commissioner quoted in Barton & Sager (1996); US tax court passed a judgment that 
four-day-old bread could be valued at full retail price for tax purposes when determining contributions deduction 
related to charity work. Bread producers can recoup maximum recoverable value subject to meeting prescribed 
conditions and requirements for tax purposes on bread that could have ended up as waste. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In commercial plant bakeries, bread returns, and associated activities can substantially impact on the costs of 
operating a plant bakery and sustainability objectives.  Through observations of case study commercial plant 
bakeries in South Africa, it can be concluded that commercial plant bakeries can run a well-coordinated supply 
chain system with reverse logistics activities that co-exist very well. Bread takebacks is the fundamental culprit 
contributing to returns and non-saleable returns can be significant. Returns in general are material to the success 
of operating a commercial plant bakery given the characteristics of the standard bread baking industry. Not all 
returns that is send for disposal  as waste is ‘not’ fit for human consumption, in some cases it can be a matter of  
simply a squashed bread rendering it unappealing to the eye though absolutely fit for consumption. Bakeries 
should find innovative ways to improve and seek new ways that will lead to the reduction and possible elimination 
of returns through investment in research & development. While the focus of this paper is on South African plant 
bakeries, findings can be generalized to commercial plant bakeries internationally. Future work should seek to

Abstract 
Over the past years, e-tailing has experienced explosive growth since it represents a more economic and convenient 
approach to purchasing in comparison to traditional shopping. During the pandemic, staying at home and not going 
out to the store made online purchasing spread widely and various e-tailing platforms have been used by consumers. 
E-tailing fulfillment experience evaluation can provide the analysis to determine the consumer preferences and 
significance of e-tailing platforms toward the new normal. With a sample size of 300 respondents from various 
individuals that have experienced buying goods and services on an e-tailing platform answered the online 
questionnaire. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to remove the biasing effects of random and 
correlated measurement errors on the outcomes of the study. The data analysis results showed that consumer 
preferences had a significant relationship with e-tailing platforms and positively influenced the e-tailing fulfillment 
experience. Also, e-tailing platforms had negative effects on the e-tailing fulfillment experience. This study 
theoretically reveals the relationship between consumer preferences and how e-tailing platforms contribute to the 
overall e-tailing fulfillment experience and provides practical suggestions for e-tailers to form sustainable competitive 
advantage through retail mix strategy.

1.   Introduction 
Traditional brick-and-mortar stores are transitioning to e-tailing as the expense costing versus brick-and-mortar stores 
are lower. There are two categories of consumer staples: essentials and non-essentials. Essential products are physical 
products that are required for the consumer to sustain life or health. Food & Beverage; Health and beauty are essential 
products. During the first lockdown when the pandemic was declared. All non-essential products were put on hold 
and essential products were hoarded as the movement of people is very limited and everyone was asked to stay at 
home (IZEA Worldwide, 2020). Non-essentials are physical products that are not required consumers get this for 
leisure and self-benefits. As the lockdown eases hoardings of essential goods have slowed down and nonessentials 
sales are going up. Due to limited movement, work from home became the new normal, and computer and electronic 
sales categories went up because of this (Harbold, 2020).  
 
During the pandemic, people are spending less of their income on items perceived as nice-to-have or non-essential 
(such as clothing, shoes, make-up, jewelry, games, and electronics). Globally too, during COVID-19, the developed 
nations are shifting towards steady-state purchasing post-stock piling as per iRi POS data (2020). The report also 
stated edible products are expected to have increased demand and non-edible products shall have a moderate need 
globally, thereby decreased demand which includes homecare, cosmetics, and personal care products (Mehta

Abstract 
 
The 5S method is a housekeeping method first practised by TOYOTA to increase productivity and efficiency in 
the manufacturing systems. The tool instils discipline and cleanliness among staff at their workstations to 
maximize efficiency and reduce the 8 wastes. The study aims at establishing how efficient the suppliers of TSAM 
and other industries in South Africa are implementing 5S by focussing on the barriers that can be removed by 
implementing 5S and the other 2 new Ss on other lean tools. A hybrid 5S tool superimposes the Poka Yoke, 
Kanban, Cleaner production, Green technologies to remove barriers thereby improving productivity in 
manufacturing.

1.0 Introduction 
The first Lean Manufacturing tool to be applied in existing Lean or Non-Lean Manufacturing (NLM) industries 
is the housekeeping 5S tool. 5S paves the path of the continuous improvement culture using Lean principles. 5S 
implementation defines the first rules to eliminate waste and maintain an efficient, safe, and clean work 
environment. Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo introduced this popular housekeeping strategy in the Toyota 
Production system (TPS).  
 
The tool cannot exist on its own unless linked to another productivity improvement strategy tool. Today the 5S 
is has been developed to 5S + 2S where the safety of the workplace and security of all stakeholders is included.

2037","Thirdly, employees buy into the 5S system when the manager’s office clean. Gemba Managers who walk and 
violate 5S protocols deliver crushing blows to the success of 5S. Managers should not violate or be afraid to 
point out a violation anytime they are on the floor with employees. A 5S champion at a company should have 
the cleanest and most organized work areas in the organization.  
 
The next step is to set up daily lookouts for 5S violations and conducting weekly or monthly audits. Each 
zone manager can conduct annual or bi-annual audits to help shed light on specific areas of concern and define 
expectations for continued improvement. Immediate feedback of findings is a good recipe for continuous 
improvement. 
 
Finally, yet importantly staff or teams that outperforming others get rewards to reinforce good practice in the 
shop floor. TSAM and its suppliers place on notice boards the successes, which are beyond the level of laid 
out standards. The charts show the success rate before and after as in Fig 7. It is important morally to reward 
the highest score and avoid pointing out the lowest scores. Before and after pictures are helpful to show others 
what going beyond looks like. When reviewing or conducting audits and looking for ways to improve your 
system, look back to identify possible areas for improvement. An error in LM is the starting point in 
productivity improvement. 
 
In LM, the Hawthorne Effect empowers and give workers ownership of the business, as well helping to build 
disciplined teams through 5S. The principle improves worker-to-worker and worker-to-manager relationships. 
The pride of Teams and managers grow when they see that what they do makes a difference. The inputs from 
eemployees are imbedded into workplace decisions to motivate the teams and make them strive to achieve the 
common goal of making the business more profitable. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The graph Fig 8 shows the outcome of implementing 5S at company that supplies TSAM. Other suppliers have 
graphs with similar trends. The 5S champions are all trained by TSAM before they go to their companies to 
implement the skill.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The study revealed that to boost productivity from your employees one needs to pay more attention to their needs 
and concerns. When employees feel more appreciated, they improve their performance. Companies that invest 
in their workers' happiness and well-being by providing employee support, and improved workplace conditions 
has bigger return on investment. 5S provides a working environment that is self-ordering, self-explaining, self-
regulating, and self-improving. 5S saves space and speed up the process of getting and feeding materials, dies, 
fixtures and jigs, thus speeding the manufacturing process. 5S reduces and eliminates the 8 wastes in 
manufacturing and create more time. 
 
Today we have many industries that practice 5S and go further to recycle waste and manufacture new products 
from old tyres, plastics, metals, and wood chips. The environment at which these exist requires the application 
of 6S principles to save time in locating specific materials. The sixth S is safety which improve the order, 
cleanliness and create a safe working environment. The other S the 7th that is job security, which prevails without 
any resistance under the present pandemic. Every employee requires safety and security to be in the 
manufacturing floor otherwise working from home is the option. Under the pandemic 5S is a visual management 
system that has improved organization efficiency in manufacturing floor. Employee morale and company image 
is determined by the sixth and seventh S. The system is an ongoing process designed for continuous 
improvement for organization’s long-term success. 
 
The Non lean companies that are adopting 5S always find it difficult when they do not use the model and fail 
to set up champions for each S. The success of 5S to companies that are adopting the principle depend on the 
culture of the people, training provided, its implementation and above all the sustenance. 5S must be clearly 
defined by senior management among workers. To sustain 5S, set a habit to maintain and improve 5S so that 
every employee is involved in developing good working habits. The methods used are driven by executive 
managers and cascaded down to the staff. Visual checks, audits controls and displays on noticeboards, on 
company TVs in the cafeteria and online simulation refreshes the staff and act as a daily reminder. Recognition 
of the team’s good performance stimulates the need to understand its benefits by other teams. When all teams 
understand and appreciate the benefits, all teams will thrive to excel be self-directing

Abstract 
 
Nowadays technology frequently makes use of IT components for implementing communication between the various 
elements that form a system. CPS (Cyber Physical Systems) are increasingly present in the industrial world and their 
application is transversal in all sectors. While this allows for greater efficiency, coordination and quality, it also opens 
to a series of completely new disruption scenarios with a potentially disastrous impact. In this context, the analysis of 
the system security and reliability pushes for a novel cyber-resilience perspective capable of evaluating not only the 
possibility of failures related to the physical and tangible part but also anomalies of and attacks to the IT counterpart. 
This work investigates this research dimension with respect to a water purification and distribution system. The 
presence of multiple documented events regarding cyber-attacks against the water industry and the consequences that 
such accidents could have on public health, further motivates this choice. A water desalination plant model and three 
cyber-attack scenarios have been developed in MATLAB/Simulink. To evaluate the societal impact of plant failures, 
a georeferenced water distribution network has been designed on EPANET. A set of resilience metrics has been 
customized for the system at hand, following a probabilistic approach that take into consideration the variability of 
cyber-attack’s duration and system response, along with the physical modeling of the process. The results provide 
evidence on the benefits of cyber-physical inspired simulation for understanding the behavior of a system, identifying 
its criticalities, and designing corrective actions.

Abstract 
While selecting the most appropriate interchange type is a major concern that transport and traffic experts 
are dealing with, one of the essential questions that repeatedly appears on the table is how to select the 
best interchange based on the contributing criteria. In the present study, the influencing factors on 
selecting interchange type are extracted by Delphi method followed by their clustering utilizing card 
sorting technique to the environment, safety, cost, executive constraint, regional, geometric 
characteristics, and traffic, and eventually applied the multi-criteria decision-making process of Dematel 
to select the best interchange type. The well-known intersection of Sanaat Square in the Iranian capital of 
Tehran has been selected as a case study and the proposed procedure performed by receiving experts’
opinions. After validating the proposed procedure, the results revealed that land use, accident reduction 
rate, domestic interchange construction experience, noise pollution reduction, distance to adjacent 
interchange, and construction cost are the main factors that play significant roles in interchange type 
selection for interchange.

1. Introduction and Literature
The increase in population which causes travel demand, as well as the growth of car ownership in Iran, has scaled up 
the traffic volume in the country that has faced transport authorities and decision-makers with the challenge of 
providing a safe, efficient, and high-speed transportation system. One of the most important elements of urban 
structures is an intersection where the traffic is dispatched based on their desired directions. The main purpose of 
building a road intersection is to enable cars to move safely in different directions. Establishing a two-level 
interchange is probably the best, but it is the costly way to manage approached traffic at intersections. Due to the 
increase in traffic at intersections, the rate of accidents that cause network delays, and accidents’ impacts,
constructing intersections is obviously necessary (Ashto, 2011). The first step in designing an intersection on urban 
roads is to select the most appropriate form of interchange according to the existing traffic directions and geometric 
situations, but a wide range of quantitative and qualitative factors that can affect the choice of interchange may 
confuse decision-makers. In the meantime, selecting a structured method for selecting the form of interchange 
depends on the experiences, engineering judgments, and recommendations of the regulations while many factors 
may be ignored. 
Traffic experts consider traffic factors such as capacity, safety, accessibility, accidents’ history and facilities, land
acquisition, construction, and maintenance costs to select the most appropriate form of the interchange (Garber and 
Fuentain, 1999). Factors like socioeconomic measures (Hui, 2009), and adaptation to the environment such as 
reducing land use (Qiao, Li and Sang, 2011), as well as cost-benefit analysis (Long et al., 2007) are also considered 
through proposing the form of intersection. In practice, Fang et al. (2005) simulated the traffic conditions of two 
types of one-point and diamond interchanges with each other based on the criteria of interchange shape, design

After exploring the effect of each factor for selecting the form of interchange, the best form of interchange must be 
found for the existing intersection under study. Equation (1) is used for rating where 𝑃𝑖 is the score of the 
interchange, 𝑎𝑥𝑖 is the score obtained according to factor x and finally, 𝑏𝑥 is the final score for intersection x. It is 
obvious that the higher score will determine the most appropriate interchange. For example, the score for single-
point interchange is determined as follows by equation (2); 
𝑃𝑖= ∑𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑏𝑥 
(1) 
𝑃𝑠= (0.128 × 0.497) + (0.109 × 3.7) + ⋯+ (0.0023 × 0.170) = 0.95 
(2) 
Applying the same procedure, PD = 0.93,Ps = 0.95,Pc = 0.80,PDc = 0.91 where 𝑃𝐷, 𝑃𝑆, 𝑃𝐶, 𝑃𝐷𝐶 are the scores 
obtained for diamond, single point, cloverleaf, and full directional, respectively. The above procedure made for all 
nominated interchanges and results shown in Table 5 which determines the best score belongs to the single point 
interchange shown in bold at the last row.

5. Validation 
In order to validate the proposed procedure, a five-
expert team composing of three traffic consultants, a 
construction project manager, and a decision support 
system consultant, were asked to look at the factors 
that are nominated as influencing factors on the 
selection of interchange type and inspect the results 
again. They set their scores based on four pre-defined 
attributes of usefulness, efficiency, satisfaction, and 
applicability of the model proposed by Mohammadi 
(2016). The nominated experts access the procedure 
and rate that following the above criteria. As shown 
in Figure 4, the score of all factors is above 50%, 
which means that the procedure meets the desired 
requirements. As shown the rate of received scores 
for the above-mentioned attributes are 0.91, 0.75, 
0.82, and 0.72, respectively for satisfaction, applicability, usefulness, and efficiency. 
 
6. Summary and conclusion 
In this study the influencing factors for selecting the type of interchange that had been previously introduced by 
researchers in other studies explored by the Delphi method manipulating the experts’ opinions. The card sorting 
technique was then used to cluster the factors into main categories. The clustering procedure has also resulted to 
extract 31 factors out of 36 explored as the leading factors. The inter-relationships of factors have been analyzed by 
Dematel and the effect of inter-relationships known as super-matrix has been powered by six times to prioritize the 
aforementioned factors. Factors have been initially ranked and sent back to the experts for reconsideration. By 
combining the experts’ opinions on the degree of importance of each factor in each interchange type and considering 
them for the case study of Sanaat square in the Iranian capital city of Tehran, the results obtained and validated to 
reveal the most appropriate interchange for the case study is Single Point type and the procedure is also capable to 
perform for other intersections. Moreover, this study shows that the six factors with the most considerable influence 
on the selection of interchange type are respectively land use, crash reduction, the domestic experience of 
construction, noise pollution reduction, distance to adjacent interchange, and construction cost. While the present 
study focuses on the urban intersections, further research may lead to study rural intersections where the factors may 
be different from what has been ranked by experts’ opinions.

Abstract  
 
Entrepreneurship is one of the solutions in overcoming unemployment which is still a polemic, such as a 
statement from the Central Statistics Agency or BPS stating that the number of unemployed based on the 
workforce in 2019 with a total of 7.05 million people, experienced an increase of 3.4 percent. This study 
aims to determine the effect of self-confidence, motivation and innovation on the entrepreneurial interest 
of Telkom University students, Bandung. The type of data used is primary data. Data were collected by 
distributing questionnaires to 100 students, then analyzed using a verification descriptive analysis method 
with a quantitative approach. Based on the analysis conducted, it is known that simultaneously self-
confidence, motivation and innovation have an influence on interest in entrepreneurship with an effect of 
69.2% as well as partially self-confidence, motivation and innovation have an influence on interest in 
entrepreneurship where the dominant influence is on self-confidence that is equal to 53.4%.

Source : Results of data processed by researchers in 2020 
 
The table above shows that the R value is 0.832 and R Square (R2) is 0.692. This figure is used to see the magnitude 
of the influence of Confidence, Motivation, and Innovation on Entrepreneurial Interest simultaneously. How to 
calculate R Square using the Coefficient of Determination (KD) using the following formula: 
 
KD = 2 x 100% 
= (0.832)2 x 100% 
= 69.2% 
 
This figure shows the coefficient of determination (KD) of 69.2%. This shows that the influence of the Independent 
Variables consisting of Self-Confidence, Motivation, and Innovation on the dependent variable, namely 
Entrepreneurial Interest is 69.2% while the remaining 30.8% is influenced by other factors. 
Based on the results of the study, the Independent Variable (X) consisting of Self-Confidence (X1), 
Motivation (X2) and Innovation (X3), together or simultaneously has a significant effect on Entrepreneurial Interest 
in Telkom University Students. This can be seen from the results of the F test, namely Fcount > Ftable (71.859 > 2.72) 
and the significance level is 0.000 <0.05. While the magnitude of the influence of the Independent Variable (X) 
consisting of Self-Confidence (X1), Motivation (X2), and Innovation (X3) on the dependent variable Entrepreneurial 
Interest (Y) can be seen from the calculation of the Coefficient of Determination (R2), which is 0.692 or 69 ,2%. 
While the remaining 30.8% is influenced by other factors not examined in this study. 
The Independent Variable (X) partially based on the t-test shows that the Confidence variable (X1) has a 
tcount (7.739) ttable > (1.986) and a significance level of 0.000 <0.05. It can be concluded that partially there is a 
significant effect of Self-Confidence (X1) on Interest in Entrepreneurship. The effect of the partial test on the Variable 
Confidence on Interest in Entrepreneurship is 53.4%. This shows that the Entrepreneurial Interest of Telkom 
University Students is influenced by the Confidence variable. Which means, a student's entrepreneurial interest can 
be seen when they have a high level of confidence such as believing in their own abilities, acting independently in 
making decisions, having a positive sense of themselves, and daring to express opinions without coercion or obstacles. 
Entrepreneurial Motivation Variable (X2) has a value of tcount (3.755) ttable > (1.986) and a significance level of 
0.000 <0.05. It can be concluded that partially there is a significant influence of Motivation (X2) on Interest in 
Entrepreneurship (Y). The magnitude of the effect of the partial test of Motivational Variables on Interest in 
Entrepreneurship is 40.6%. This shows that the motivation of Telkom University students is influenced by the 
motivation variable, which means that the entrepreneurial motivation of Telkom University students can be influenced 
by the desire to excel, courage in taking risks, understanding uncertainty, trust in oneself and others, independence. , 
a strong desire for something, and the creativity that exists in a person can foster an interest in entrepreneurship in 
these students. 
Innovation variable (X3) has a value of tcount (3.492) ttable > (1.986) and a significance level of 0.001 <0.05. 
It can be concluded that partially there is a significant influence of Innovation (X3) on Entrepreneurial Interest (Y). 
The magnitude of the effect of the partial test on the Innovation Variable on Interest in Entrepreneurship is 37.6%. 
This shows that the motivation of Telkom University students is influenced by the Innovation variable, which means 
that innovation is the ability to apply a brilliant idea and solution to the problems and opportunities that exist in doing 
something new that can generate high interest in entrepreneurship because it has innovations. A new one that is capable 
of turning an opportunity into an idea that can be sold and provides added value with the effort, time, finances, and 
capability to make a profit.

59.30% (100% -40.70%) is explained by other variables not examined in this study.. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research and discussions that have been carried out regarding the effect of price 
earning ratio (PER), price to book value (PBV) and return on equity (ROE) on stock prices at Unilever Companies for 
the 2015-2020 period, the following conclusions are obtained: 
1. The following is a description of the development of price earning ratio (PER), price to book value (PBV) and 
return on equity (ROE) to share prices at Unilever Companies for the 2015-2020 period. 
a. The development of price earning ratio (PER) on stock prices based on the results of the discussion obtained that 
the PER condition in Unilever companies shows that there is a level of increase and decrease in the PER value. 
This is caused by changes in the share price of a company if the company's shares manage to score a high enough 
value, this means that the market really appreciates the shares, which is marked by the large number of requests 
for these shares. The PER value of PT Unilever which is the sample of observations for 6 years tends to vary. 
When viewed from the trend of PER 2015-2020 from year to year tends to fluctuate, the period that has the highest 
percentage of Price Earning Ratio (PER) is in the 1st quarter of 2019 amounting to 213.96 in 2018, while the 
company that has the lowest PER is in the 4th quarter of 2018 of 38.00. 
b. The development of price to book value (PBV) on stock prices based on the results of the discussion obtained that 
the condition of PBV at Unilever companies shows that there is a level of increase and decrease in the value of 
PBV. This is because the PBV is strongly influenced by the book value of the stock, if the stock price is higher 
than the book value, the resulting PBV will be high, and vice versa if the stock price does not have a high enough 
price compared to the book value, the resulting PBV will be smaller than before. . The average price of PT 
Unilever's PBV in the 2015-2020 period is 55.65, meaning that this shows the stock market price of 55.65 times 
its book value. 
c. The development of return on equity (ROE) on stock prices is based on the results of the discussion obtained that 
the condition of PT Unilever's ROE value which is the sample of observations for 6 years tends to vary. When 
viewed from the 2015-2020 ROE trend from year to year, it tends to fluctuate, the overall average ROE in 2015-

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to understand factors that affect discomfort among elementary students studying at home 
and construct an ideal computer workstation using the anthropometric measurements gathered from the target 
respondents. A computer workstation is composed of a chair and a table and is used as a computer terminal for students 
when attending classes at the comfort of their home. Having a workstation at home is essential for workers and students 
for work or academic purposes. However, users of computer workstations are commonly affected by Musculoskeletal 
Disorders (MSD). In this study, the body discomfort of the subjects is measured through an instrument named Corlett’s 
& Bishop's body map questionnaire. The study was conducted requiring information on the profile of the respondents 
regarding the use of their workstations at home as well as their anthropometric measurements. The statistical analysis 
used in the study is ANOVA, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. These were used to determine the different 
types of MSD experienced by respondents on the use of different types of tables and chair and other factors related to 
their online class at home. Based on the result of the analysis, it was proved that poor sitting posture can significantly 
affect the discomfort of respondents on their body parts such as lower arm, mid-back, buttocks, lower back, neck, and 
upper arm. It was also revealed that workstation design factors significantly affect the discomfort of respondents 
particularly the table height, table width, and seat height. Given these conditions, the researchers proposed an ideal 
workstation design for elementary students using the anthropometric measurements gathered from the respondents.

1.  Introduction 
A computer workstation is a high-performance system that is composed of advanced graphics, large storage space, 
and a Central Processing Unit (CPU) or a powerful processor that can be used in varieties of tasks. A new form of an 
ergonomic computer workstation is proposed to allow users to sit in several working positions and provide greater 
comfort for people who spend a long time sitting at their workstations (Workined & Yamaura, 2015). Having a well-
adjusted workstation decreases discomfort and stretch pose issues. Additionally, adjusting the work to the specialist 
essentially decreases weariness and muscle pressure. To set an appropriate pose for the user, it is important to be 
attentive to the discomfort and pain felt to create an acceptable posture for the user. All the elements of a workstation 
are interdependent, such as the chair, table, computer, etc. Adjusting one of the components will result in a re-
adjustment of another component needed (Maerix, 2016). Ergonomics is widely used in computer workstations to

The researchers discovered that elementary students nowadays are utilizing office chairs, Monoblock chairs, wooden 
chairs, metal chairs, and stools as their seats based on the findings of the study. They are employing glass tables, 
wooden tables, and metal tables for tables. Age, gender, duration of study, site or area of study, frequency of study, 
kind of table, and kind of chair are all risk variables that might contribute to MSD in elementary students. Using their 
existing workstation, elementary students noticed high discomfort in their lower arm and mild discomfort in their right 
thigh when studying. The researchers have also identified that study hours have significant differences between the 
study and the type of chairs have significant differences that can affect the discomfort level in their current study 
station or workstation.  The factors that have a considerable influence and contribute to the pain of Elementary 
Students include sitting posture, table width, and seat height. Finally, using anthropometric data, the researchers 
created an ergonomic workstation that matched the body dimensions of the elementary students, and the office chair 
is the best sort of chair to use in study stations.

Abstract 
 
Physical environments like noise, temperature, and illumination are frequently associated with students’ participation and 
academic performance. This study aimed to identify the effects of the physical learning environment on the learnability and 
engagement of students during online classes. A total of 30 Grade 12 students from Mapúa University, during the academic 
year 2020–2021 were chosen as the correspondents. Survey questionnaires were provided to collect information from the 
respondents' demographic profiles as well as measures for the sources of the work environment such as the source of light, 
noise, and temperature. Furthermore, the student's reaction time was measured using the Stroop Test Experiment through 
CogLab: The Online Cognition Lab software, while the assessment of their physical learning environment was obtained using 
mobile applications. From the data gathered, the correlational analysis was used to evaluate the relationship of the independent 
variable (physical environment levels) to the dependent variable (reaction time). Subsequently, multiple regression analysis 
was used to determine the significant factor affecting the reaction time of students. Results showed from the correlation 
analysis that illumination and noise level have significant relationships to the reaction time of students, having p-value 
<0.0001 and Pearson correlation of -0.902 and 0.865 respectively. Moreover, it was found that illumination level was the only 
factor that significantly affects the reaction time the most (p-value<0.001). 
 
1. Introduction 
In 2014, Asiyai stated that a classroom’s physical environment condition significantly affects the students' motivation to 
engage in classroom activities. It can influence students’ behavior, attendance, health, enjoyment, and learning (Asiyai, 2014; 
Che Ahmad & Amirul, 2019). Cantrell (2019) also added that teachers should create a positive physical learning environment 
to make students feel emotionally and physically comfortable learning in the classroom. Otherwise, a poor, substandard 
classroom physical environment is just as detrimental to the students' learning as a bad curriculum (Hannah, 2013). Physical 
environments like noise, temperature, and illumination are frequently associated with the student's participation and academic 
performance. The learnability of students is physiologically and psychologically affected by these factors. According to Barth 
et al. (2014), poor workplaces were correlated with substandard ranges of students' aggression and academic focus. Edem et 
al. (2017) added that students and employees' productivity decreased because of poorly planned environmental workplaces as 
it resulted in no motivation and no work satisfaction. In the study of Gilavand (2016), noise pollution, inappropriate lighting, 
and temperature played a vital role in students' education quality. Ergonomically speaking, the design of learning 
environments is necessary to optimize human interaction with peers and improve academic and work resilience. Students are 
also seen to perform well in a lively workplace atmosphere where they feel safe, secure, and involved (Suleman & Hussain, 
2014). There has been a significant number of studies that aim to identify the effects of physical environments, such as 
illumination, noise, and temperature, on a student’s academic performance. However, those particular studies did not satisfy

The study identified the relationship of noise, illumination, and temperature level to the learnability of students, assess their 
physical working environment and determine the factor that significantly affects students' reaction time. The only factor that 
significantly affected the reaction time of students was the illumination level, having a p-value less than 0.05. Additionally, a 
significant difference was found in the reaction time of students based on time of day. The reaction time of students' studying 
at night was also relatively higher than those students studying in the morning, afternoon, and midnight. The analysis showed 
that as the level of illumination decreases, the reaction time of the student's increases. In light of this, the relationship of 
illumination level to the academic performance of students was strongly negatively correlated, having a Pearson value of -
0.902. While the noise level increases, the reaction time of students increases as well, having a strong positive correlation 
with a Pearson value of 0.865. Although illumination and noise level were the only ones having a significant relationship with 
the reaction time, based on the ANOVA test, the temperature level has an effect on the students' reaction time based on the 
time of day with a p-value less than 0.05. The findings suggested that only the illumination and noise levels have a significant 
effect on the students' reaction time. Thus, students during online classes need to have good lighting and a relatively quiet 
physical learning environment to maintain a low reaction time.

Abstract 
 
As systems become more connected, their complexity arises likewise. It is true that often in looking at a process by 
decomposing it in subsystems there are some information that go lost. Process components interact with each other in 
direct and indirect ways and the more the model is precise, the more the view on its functioning is clear. It could be 
affirmed that the whole carries more information that the sum of its parts.  
In this context, there is the need to develop integrated models to better evaluate critical system’s properties as safety 
and reliability could be. This work presents the development of a simulation model that aims to evaluate the impact 
on society a water purification plant failures may have. To do so, the purification plant is digitalised in the 
MATLAB/Simulink virtual environment by modeling each of its component through Simscape physical blocks 
libraries. Moreover, a wider view is provided by the modelling of a water distribution network through EPANET, a 
hydraulic-simulation specific software. The two models are finally connected one to another with the implementation 
of a MATLAB custom script that makes use of an open-source toolkit to reproduce the real-world integrated system. 
Simulations are made by taking into account system’s safety issues as water shortage or contaminated water 
distribution, but the presented model can easily be adapted to evaluate different system properties.

Abstract 
 
The increase number of births in Indonesia during the pandemic era provided opportunities for baby equipment 
businesses. At the same time, online purchase transactions have also increased. This research objective is to determine 
the segmentation and worth of each customer segment using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and develop strategies 
for every customer segmentation in order to increase the value of business competitiveness. The K-Means Clustering 
method is applied to segment clients into a few clusters and the CLV value is used to specify the value of each customer 
segment with the RFM variable. Cluster deployment using Customer Value Matrix (CVM) is also carried out to ensure 
cluster characteristics. Secondary data is obtained from sales transactions. Analysis of product sales is carried out 
using the Association Rules method that results in one of the strategies in Customer Development. The research 
resulted in 5 clusters for customers with 16 strategies for the whole cluster. Cross-selling strategy is the most 
recommended strategy.

1. Introduction  
Pandemic in Indonesia has provided opportunities for business in the baby equipment sector because birth rate 
increased by 15%, also online shopping in e-commerce increased 25% in sales (“IdEA: Kenaikan Penjualan E-
Commerce 25 Persen Selama Pandemi - Bisnis Tempo.Co,” n.d.). This situation gives opportunity for business owners 
who focused on baby equipment sector to expand their market through e-commerce platforms. Customer Relationship 
Management (CRM) is used to build and maintain the relationship between business and its customers. It is important 
for businesses to use CRM and maintain their customers, especially those that are profitable for the company(Dachyar, 
Esperanca, & Nurcahyo, 2019). CRM is important for businesses to know how to find out the loyalty of the customers 
that they have. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
This study aims to find out customer segmentation on baby equipment business. By knowing the segmentation of the 
customers, business can count the value of CLV on each of the segments so that strategies for each segmentation could 
be formed to help business increase its competitiveness value. 
 
2. Literature Review  
E-commerce provides amenities during the time spent computerized exchange that goes for online merchants and 
customers (Nisar & Prabhakar, 2017). E-commerce is a tool that fasten the business transaction process through the 
internet that includes the exchange of valuable information in products and services form, also payment with a 
technology that is web-based (H. Zaied, 2012). Based on the relationship of sellers and buyers, e-commerce can be 
categorized in five types, which are: B2B Commerce (transaction between two business units), B2C Commerce (a 
transaction between business unit to personal customers), C2B Commerce (transaction where the individual is the 
seller and the business unit is the buyer), C2C Commerce (transaction between individuals), and Cooperative Trade 
(all the colleague in the business inventory network are collaborating) (Turban, King, Lee, Liang, & Turban, 2015). 
There are so many benefits customers could have through e-commerce, such as the increase of products variety, less

2094","variations in the data without being too concerned about the strength or weakness of the association between the data, 
the minimum value can be set low. 
 
Results of the determination of this minimum value will affect the results of the final process of association rule, and 
the following is the process of association rule that is done to obtain the optimal product bundling by using 
STATISTICA software. Here are the steps in doing association rules: 
1. Entering a database that has been created entirely in the STATISTCIA software, with the headers in the data used 
as variables in the software. 
2. Entering the variables that will be analyzed in the next process 
3. Determining the value of minimum support, minimum confidence value, and maximum item sets in body and 
maximum item set in head that will determine the outcome of treatment. 
4. Repeat the third step if you want to get association results that have more relationship strength than those 
generated previously by increasing the minimum support and confidence values entered. 
 
Minimum value of support and confidence put by the researcher is 0.2%. The results of this process show 6 rule sets 
which will be shown in Table 12 below. Confidence value ranges from 0.36%-0.68%. Support value ranges from 
0.2%-0.23%. In Table 12 it can be seen that the largest confidence value is in rule number 1, namely C10 -> B3 with 
a support value of 0.21% and a confidence value of 6.8%. The support value of 0.21% means that this rule has appeared 
40 times for purchases. The confidence value obtained alone is 6.8%, which means that if in a transaction there is B10, 
then the probability of buying a B3 product is 6.8% from 40 times, which is 3 times.

The characteristics of each cluster are generated which are used to produce customer development strategies, which 
are carried out to maintain relationships with customers so that customers can continue to contribute to business 
development, and can improve the company's competitiveness (Khajvand et al., 2011). 
 
From the results of the analysis of customer segmentation and distribution on the CVM matrix, clusters 4 and 5 have 
the highest loyalty, then the first thing to do is to create a loyalty point feature on customers' accounts. (Peker et al., 
2017). Furthermore, further developing assistance as far as conveyance, giving quicker data about items can likewise 
keep up with the connection between the organization and its clients (Khajvand et al., 2011; Valvi & Fragkos, 2012) 
 
In the cluster that is included in the first time and uncertain customer in CLV analysis using RFM and enters the third 
quadrant with the uncertain category on the CVM matrix, namely clusters 1,2, and 3, increasing customer awareness 
of the company and customers can maintain and improve relationships with customers that will make a growing desire 
to transact (Buttle & Maklan, 2015; Wang & Singh, 2006). Special services provided online and in real-time can affect 
customer loyalty (Dachyar & Athory, 2015) The use of social media to deepen customer engagement and delivery of 
questionnaires to determine the pattern and consideration to purchasing customers can help companies to develop 
strategies for further (Peker, Kocyigit, & Eren, 2017). 
 
Cross-selling and up-selling methods are also methods that can be added in the implementation of customer 
development strategies to lure customers to increase the number of purchases (Buttle & Maklan, 2015). 
Recommendations for product equivalents for cross-selling are also found in the results of product data processing 
using Association Rules. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study intends to help the baby equipment business in investigating customer loyalty based on CLV segmentation. 
The outcomes called attention to five customer clusters based on RFM characteristics, namely Best/Valuable, First

customer relationships with the company to give an impact on customer loyalty. These steps are based on RFM 
characteristics by preserving customer convenience, improving customer trust in the company, attracting customers 
to make repeat transactions, and increasing customer satisfaction and customer service quality.

Abstract  
 
Escalator maintenance for public facilities needs attention because it can cause time, cost, and safety losses for 
escalator users. This study aims to design an electronic maintenance system, supported by Internet of Things (IoT) 
and Relational Database. Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) method is carried out to improve processes and 
through business simulation processes using iGrafx software. The design of information systems is arranged in several 
stages, making an entity relationship diagrams (ERD), use case diagrams, relational tables, and data flow diagrams 
(DFD). four maintenance options that result in different maintenance. The combination of information system, CMMS 
and sensor scenarios resulted in the best improvement rate of 23.65%.

1. Introduction  
Indonesian Central Statistics Agency, in 2020 has a population of 270.20 million people with various needs, to 
accommodate these needs, Shopping center is one of solution. (Indonesian Central Statistics Agency, 2020). To 
explore the shopping center, several vertical transportations are provided such as escalators, elevators, and stairs. The 
escalator is used because it is easy to use, so it can create a positive attitude for visitors to be enthusiastic to explore 
shopping centers, and it is also the most efficient transportation because it can accommodate many people between 
floors (Zaman, 2020) 
 
To maintain optimal performance at the shopping center facilities, it is necessary to maintain facilities through 
maintenance activities. Maintenance is also important in accordance with the rules that have been determined by the 
government, it was said that when compared to escalators to elevators, it has 10 times the dysfunction per unit 
(Construction Competency and Training Center, 2006). The main factor is negligence in maintenance, inspection, and 
operation, which can cause speed conditions to suddenly stop, the direction of the escalator to suddenly change, and 
the handrail suddenly unable to function optimally (Amillia & Basir, 2018). 
 
1.1 Objectives  
Designing an electronic maintenance monitoring system on the escalator, supported by Relational Database and 
Internet of Things (IoT) technology, with Business Process Engineering method and information systems. 
 
2. Literature Review  
Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) is a principal re-planning and a fundamental re-conceptualize processes of a 
business to achieve better  performance and improvement of key indicators, such as expenses, time, and convenience 
(Caeldries et al., 1994). BPR is also defined as a management of strategy for business with focuses on analyzing and 
concepting new design for material and information workflows and processes within a structure. This technique 
recommends the old system need to be readjusted with a new system so it can be more innovative and effective 
(Dachyar & Christy, 2014). BPR aims to achieve dramatic increases in company performance measures using the 
latest information technology (IT) to fundamentally and radically redesign business processes (Dachyar & Pertiwi, 
2020).

Abstract  
 
Indonesia experienced an economic catastrophe as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. The shopping center industry 
as a place for public transactions has been severely affected, especially with the accelerated transition to online 
shopping platforms. The expected outcome of this research is an alternative strategy for shopping center performance’s 
recovery. SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threat) method identifies the company's internal and 
external factors obtained through expert interviews. The method used to find the weight of each internal and external 
SWOT factor is FAHP. The performance of each alternative strategy is assessed using the Complex Proportional 
Assessment (COPRAS) method. This study resulted in two strategic priorities, accommodate a vaccination facility 
and buy online pick up offline (BOPIS) method facilities.

1. Introduction  
The world reshaped in March 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) proclaimed COVID-19, a new form 
of beta coronavirus as a global pandemic. The Indonesian government implements the national social restriction 
regulation, which was aimed to control the transmission rate. The regulation includes people interaction limitations 
and urges offices/schools to implement work/learn from home, cancel any religious ceremony that could form a crowd, 
limit any social or cultural activities in public, and close all public spaces. 
 
Shopping centers function as a meet-up place for society suffers a significant impact from the regulation. The 
regulation and public concern regarding safety and health protocols has further influenced people's shopping methods 
shifted from offline. Indonesia as the first country to have the highest online transaction in Southeast Asia and are 
expected to escalate in the following years are impacted significantly (Dachyar & Banjarnahor, 2017). Data shown in 
Figure 1 pictured the value of e-commerce transactions in Indonesia for 2017-2020 has a compounded annual growth 
rate (CAGR) of 85% (Statista, 2020).

It can be concluded from the graph above the priority strategy to implement at the Perdana Mall is the vaccination 
facilities for local residents (SO3) and collaboration with an e-commerce company to implement the Buy Online 
Pickup In-Store (BOPIS) facility (ST1). In the long term, strategies are also needed to retain customers in the future. 
For this reason, the strategies in the second quadrant to create new outdoor activities (SO2) and open the cinema 
facilities with requirements of vaccination or PCR (ST1) are prioritized in the following implementation. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Pandemic lockdown regulations severely impact the shopping center industry, especially with online shopping 
platforms as the product substitute gained more acknowledged over the years. Good strategic management is needed 
to restore its performance midst of a pandemic. Strategy formulation starts with an interview with experts to generate 
the internal and external criteria of Mall Perdana and to obtain alternative strategies. Later the strategies are evaluated 
based on the factor and subfactor, which are considered essential for the performance recovery by experts. Sixteen 
subfactors with six strengths, three weaknesses, four opportunities, and three threats from the SWOT analysis are 
chosen based on literature review and expert judgments. Calculated with the fuzzy AHP method, Opportunities are 
found as the factor with the highest level of importance from the other four SWOT factors. Distribution of Indonesian 
citizens (O4) has the highest level of importance out of 17 subfactors. The weights of each factor and subfactors 
obtained with the fuzzy AHP are later inputted in the COPRAS method calculation to evaluate each alternative 
strategy. Alternative strategy with the highest performance value based on the COPRAS method is Providing 
Vaccination Facilities (SO3) and the implementation priority alternative strategy based on the Impact-Effort Diagram 
is to provide vaccination facilities (SO3) and buy online pick up in-store (ST1) facilities.

Abstract 
 
The palm oil processing industry is the largest foreign exchange-producing industry for the Indonesian economy 
currently and is increasing with the presence of B-30 Mandatory in Indonesia. The focus of this paper to decide the 
most suitable Internet of Things technology to be implemented in palm oil mills, especially for water treatment and 
boiler maintenance, as well as the most significant criteria as well as sub-criteria for implementing IoT technology. 
The methods of this study are  the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to acquire weights of the sub criteria and the 
Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) to assess alternative technologies. The research resulted in the criteria 
that significantly influence the implementation of IoT, namely ease of use, competitive pressure, relative advantage, 
and the recommended technology which is CMMS.

1. Introduction 
The volume of palm oil production has increased to 45 million tons in 2019. Indonesia also ranks first as a palm oil 
producer in the world. In 2020, the value of palm oil exports rose by 13.6% (Indonesian Palm Oil Business 
Association, 2017) The use of palm oil is also predicted to increase due to the mandatory B-30 policy that has been 
set by President Joko Widodo at the end of 2019, in which diesel fuel contain 30% fatty acid methyl ester, a processed 
form of palm oil. (Directorate General of New Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation, 2019) 
 
There are several processes inside the plantations and palm oil mills, starting from palm fruit nurseries to processing 
fruit bunches in the factory. The processes in this plant use electricity obtained from turbines driven by steam power. 
The steam comes from the boiler, which gets feed water from the water treatment circuit. The water that will be used 
as feeder also has standards that must be met, starting from the pH level to the amount of silica and iron. If the boiler 
does not work then the activities of the entire plant can be stopped and cause losses. The focus of this paper will center 
around the water treatment and boiler network, namely the water reservoir, clarifier, sand filter, water tower, cation 
exchange tank, degasifier, anion exchange tank, and boiler. Currently in carrying out their maintenance procedure, the 
plantation that is studied have not applied any technology that enables live water condition tracking, or remote water 
condition tracking. The plant still relies on manual sampling and thus is prone to human error, overall boiler stagnation, 
and the inability for top management located in other cities to survey the daily maintenance processes.  
 
Internet of Things also known as IoT is a type of network that could connect anything to the internet according to a 
defined protocol with the aim of exchanging information and communication. (Patel, 2016) A research conducted by 
Madushanki et al in 2019 said that in the context of agriculture, IoT is widely used in the context of water management 
and equipment maintenance, both in the top 10 categories. (Madushanki et al., 2019)

6. Conclusion  
 
The results showed that there were several conclusions from this study, which are: validation testing on sub-criteria 
collected through literature study resulted in 23 selected sub-criteria from a total of 30 sub-criteria, the criterion for 
Technology has the highest importance weight out of 4 criteria and the Ease-of-Use sub-criteria has the highest 
importance weight out of 28 sub-criteria, the IoT technology ranking results using COPRAS show CMMS Technology 
as the technology with the highest utility level. Based scenario calculation, there are no change in selected technology 
although there is a change in the utility level of SCADA technology.

Abstract 
 
Supply Chain in the agribusiness industry is strongly influenced by warehouse facilities. Bananas that have been 
harvested need to be stored properly before being distributed to buyers. This study aims to design business process 
improvements by utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) and expected to increase warehouse time efficiency. The Business 
Process Re-engineering (BPR) method was used to design improvements to warehouse operational process using the 
iGrafx software. Improvements to warehouse operations are carried out on the inbound and ripening process. This 
study resulted in two scenarios in the inbound process, scenario A using an automated inventory system based on 
RFID becomes the scenario with the greatest time efficiency of 18%. The ripening process has three scenarios, 
scenario C which combines the use of an automated inventory system based on RFID and an automated monitoring 
system has the highest efficiency of 24%.

1. Introduction 
From 2011 to 2014, fruits were the commodity that contributed the most to Indonesia’s GDP compared to other 
horticultural sectors. Indonesia became the country with the 7th largest producer of fresh fruit in the world in 2018. 
In Indonesia banana was the fruit with the highest number of exports in 2019 which was in line with banana production 
that continues to increase until 2020 (Statistics Indonesia, 2021). 
  
This research conducted at a company that supplies fresh fruit and vegetables to traditional and modern markets in 
Greater Jakarta and Bandung. Cavendish banana is a primary product of the company. Banana was categorized as 
easily damaged fruit with 5-10 days shelf life (Akter et al., 2015). Therefore, bananas need careful handling in their 
supply chain and optimal conditions in a perishable warehouse (Barraco, 2018). Based on interviews with experts, 
banana warehouse operations currently took a lot of time so the quality control and sorting processes for other fruits 
were often hampered. The inefficiency of warehouse operations also occurred in unloading, temperature & humidity, 
and inventory management aspects.  
 
Internet of Things (IoT) became a solution. IoT had been predicted to be a new era of information technology with a 
lot of potential development. IoT played a role in increasing inventory management efficiency (Riad et al., 2018). IoT 
could be implemented in warehouse management, for example, to track and monitor products, forecast demand, 
inventory management, and real-time data revenue from all processes in warehouse operations (Hamdy et al., 2018). 
The advantage of using the IoT was the presence of real-time information which helped solve problems faster than 
traditional warehouses. The automation of manual tasks made the workforce more efficient and IoT increased 
operational scalability (van Geest et al., 2021). 
  
1.1 Objectives 
This research aims to improve banana warehouse operation using Internet of Things (IoT) technology with Business 
Process Reengineering approach to improve warehouse time efficiency in the current banana warehouse operations.

6. Conclusion 
This research resulted in improvements in the banana warehouse. Improvements to the operational process of the 
banana warehouse were done in two processes, inbound process and outbound process. Two scenarios were developed 
in the inbound process to solve inventory problems, scenario A used an automated inventory system based on RFID 
and scenario B used an automated inventory system based on QR-Code. Three scenarios were designed in the

Abstract  
 
Tech startup companies have been experiencing significant developments in the digital era, requiring competitive 
strategy, capital, and innovative business model. This research study aims to provide strategic recommendation to 
achieve IPO success of tech startup companies through the Partial Least Square of SEM method with the initial 
hypothesis from the research model that IPO project success is potential to be achieved through Technical, Financial, 
Social, Political, and other variables that represent the company image, prospectus and business performance. In 
addition, PLS-SEM method aims to predict correlations and interrelationships among variables, through the expert 
validation stage, involving pilot testing of 131 respondents, and a final questionnaire of 300 people. The calculation 
results indicate that the success of  IPO is related to other variables (0.257), Financial (0.255), Technical (0.198), 
Social (0.168), and Political (0.144) with a predictive coefficient of Project Feasibility (0.98), which indicates that the 
initial hypothesis was accepted and proven by statistical parameters. Hence, the results of this research provide 
recommendations for  standardization of work, structured business strategies, and innovation of the company's 
Business Model Canvas (BMC) to successfully conduct an IPO and attract investors.

1. Introduction  
Tech Startup existed as a company that provides digital business-based platforms offering sales strategy services and 
education related to user business strategies (referred to as resellers) for products offered on the application platform  
(Ioniţă, 2017; Thomas et al., 2010). Several educational services are provided in the form of WhatsApp group 
discussion, webinars from experts in digital business industries, and workshop to support the community business 
activities (Hooi et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2021) in order to maximize the business impact while encountering digital 
business competition in Indonesian market (Das et al., 2016). Delivering the company value proposition through 
additional services to user has been regarded to positively impact the user trust (Bugshan & Attar, 2020), thereby 
enhancing the business sustainability (Kitsios et al., 2020). Business strategy in tech startup has been complex, due to 
the demand in sustaining the business sector with rapid growth of stakeholder trust  (Kim & Kim, 2018; Muramalla 
& Al-Hazza, 2019; Okrah et al., 2018) from broad and diverse consumer around the world (Chang & Li, 2019). 
 
Regarding the IPO plan for tech startup company’s need, business strategy feasibility research plays an instrumental 
role to create more precise strategy, while additionally considering the resources and company capability. The process 
itself includes company's performance review to identify the internal factor and stakeholder perspective from 
consumer and potential investor to identify the external factor of business strategy (Chhabra & Kiran, 2020; Foucault 
& Frésard, 2019). 
 
1.1 Objectives  
This research study aims to provide strategic recommendations based on the evaluation results from the calculation of 
the SEM methodology to maintain company value, by providing optimal benefits for relevant stakeholders, especially 
those involved in projects leading up to the IPO as well as investors.

Abstract 
 
A business practice that is economically viable, socially responsible and environmentally friendly is usually regarded 
as being sustainable. Corporations that include socially responsible and environmentally sound policies as core 
elements in their growth strategy very often create sustainable economic values. In the Philippines, thru the 
Department of Trade and Industry, the promotion of Green Economic Development (GED) aims to propel Micro, 
Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and government institutions to increase its sustainability initiatives with 
priority in environmental performance relative to economic development. Interventions to make their business more 
environment-friendly and climate-smart, namely: information and awareness; green service facilitation; and green 
framework conditions were analyzed of its significance and interrelationships to the intention Recycled Paper-Based 
Producers in the Philippines to adopt sustainable business practices. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) 
approach was used with a survey of the top 50% players of said industry resulting in a platform model of sustainability 
with GED interventions influencing many of the companies’ thrust to institutionalize sustainable business practices 
of equipping employees with knowledge of green manufacturing, providing renewable resources and green process 
capability, and enhancing value through cost-efficiencies in the use and reuse of materials and energy.

1. Introduction  
 
Recycled-based paper manufacturing can have negative effects on the environment if not appropriately managed. 
Though there are technologies nowadays that can moderate the negative impacts on the environment while having a 
positive economic effect, attaining economic growth while protecting the environment is challenging and has received 
wide attention in recent research programs (Cabalova, 2014). The ASEAN community is progressively becoming the 
leading player in Green Economic Development (GED), which promotes economic growth and development while 
ensuring that natural resources and environmental services critical to our societal well-being continue to be available. 
Additionally, it stimulates investment and innovation, thereby sustaining growth and creating new economic prospects 
(Gutterer, 2015). The manufacturing industry in the Philippines faces the challenge of being proactive and responsive 
to this global trend. In the Philippine context, the paper industry aspires to create the competence to meet the fastest 
emerging paper demands and to produce high-value, high-quality paper products for the long term while remaining 
internationally competitive and environmentally sustainable (Retrieved from GOV.PH, 2017).

6. Conclusion 
 
Today, sustainability has become an essential part of manufacturing and business strategies in the pulp and paper 
industry. This study has contributed to the discussion about institutionalizing sustainable business practices infused 
with green economic development initiatives to the pulp and paper industry. A structural model is built to display the 
relationships between the constructed latent factors by integrating the theory of reasoned action (TRA) to understand 
the intention to adopt sustainable business practices in daily operations. A total of 150 data samples are collected 
through the distribution of an online questionnaire, which contained 25 questions. The result showed that green 
economic development initiatives (GED) significantly affect intention to adapt to sustainable business practices (SBP) 
and sustainability institutionalization. Also, GED initiatives can influence the sustainability institutionalization of the 
company. Finally, the established recommended strategic industry-wide framework for sustainability 
institutionalization can help policymakers of the organization gain profit without taking for granted the environmental 
damages they may cause thru continuous innovation.

Abstract 
 
Over the past years, there has been a shift in the style of work carried out in terms of employee’s location of work. 
Employees have expanded their location of the working environment to have the opportunity of carrying out their 
day-to-day tasks at any time, in any chosen location, especially now that the world is having a global pandemic. The 
current study utilized a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach to determine what organizational policy and 
employee engagement program will best suit WFH employees with respect to varying factors that are perceived to 
drive home-based employee performance consistent with organizational strategy and objectives. A total of 158 
respondents were collected from the survey. The result of this study showed that WFH arrangement is significantly 
affected by the company factors, which include the people management, HR policies, government compliance, and 
executive leaders of the company. Subsequently, the result also proved that employees’ engagement has a moderating 
effect on the WFH arrangements of the company and their employees’ effectiveness in their job. Hence, the established 
implementation framework of the WFH arrangements from the findings of this study will benefit the company by the 
increase of high performing, productive, and engaged workforce.

1. Introduction 
 
The prevalence of work from home (WFH) arrangements in firms has grown in recent decades primarily due to 
advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT), which revolutionized everyday work and life in 
the 21st century. Work from home (WFH) setup is an arrangement for people working from their abode or other 
location of their choice away from the employer’s workplace on paid time as provided by their employer (Schall, 
2019). Also, WFH is characterized by two main aspects, namely: (a) employees under the arrangement with their 
employers, WFH employees use mostly smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers to perform work outside 
the employer’s premises (Eurofound & ILO, 2017). work outside the common workplace, and (b) a connection 
between home and office exists. With the disruption caused by the coronavirus, most companies required their 
employees to work from home full-time to comply with the pandemic protocols due to reasons of health risks and 
safety. As such, all WFH employees who perform work tasks and activities during the crisis will expect this set up 
toward the new normal (ILO, 2020). 
 
According to Cohan (2013), a work-from-home environment can improve employees’ level of engagement since such 
an environment allows employees to carry out their other responsibilities outside of work.  It encourages a better 
work/life balance, brings about improvements in their health and well-being, and also leads to increased motivation 
with less stress and with a sustained level of engagement when provided with telecommuting facilities (Griswold, 
2014) for remote workers that have a personal connection to the organization’s mission and vision and where they 
feel the work culture is familial (Lee, 2018). As employees have different preferences, mandatory working from home 
could induce dissatisfaction (Belanger, 1999). Additionally, WFH is experienced as a benefit and as a symbol of 
appreciation and trust if it is voluntary. Only under this condition, employees respond to working from home with 
“extra” work effort (Fehr & Gachter, 2000).

4. Conclusion  
 
Work from home is defined as work performed from various places that change employees to increase their labor 
activeness by the utility of information and communicating technologies. It has been considered as an alternative way 
of manage work since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized the Structural Equation Modelling 
(SEM) approach to determine what organizational policy and employee engagement program will best suit WFH 
arrangements of the employees with respect to varying factors that are perceived to drive home-based employee 
effectiveness. A total of 158 respondents answered the survey questionnaire distributed online, which contained 38 
questions. The result of this study showed that WFH arrangement is significantly affected by the company factors, 
which include the people management, HR policies, government compliance, and executive leaders of the company. 
Subsequently, the result also proved that employees’ engagement has a moderating effect on the WFH arrangements 
of the company and their employees’ effectiveness in their job. Hence, the established implementation framework of 
the WFH arrangements from the findings of this study will benefit the company by the increase of high performing, 
productive, and engaged workforce.

Abstract 
 
Internet of Things (IoT) had been one of the applications of industry 4.0 that played a vital role in changing the 
industrial and business processes by integrating various systems and processes independently. Thus, applying IoT 
help improved the manufacturing industry and helped gain a competitive advantage among our neighboring countries. 
This study focused on identifying the driving and restraining forces and the readiness of the Philippine manufacturing 
SMEs in adopting IoT. The researchers conducted a survey among Philippine manufacturing SMEs about their 
perception regarding IoT driving and restraining forces and their willingness to adopt IoT. The study utilized Structural 
Equation Modelling, Kurt Lewin’s Force Field Analysis, and readiness model. The result showed that Philippine 
manufacturing SMEs are likely to adopt IoT, however, were neutral about applying full blast IoT technologies such 
as sensors for full operating conditions, and cloud systems, and big data analytics. In conclusion, ease of management 
and initial investment showed significance in adopting IoT. This study suggests future researchers dig deeper into how 
manufacturing SMEs can gain competitive advantage by applying IoT in their operations to (1) minimize cost, (2) 
improve quality control, and (3) minimize waste after prompting the willingness of the manufacturing SMEs in 
adopting IoT.

1. Introduction 
The term “Industry 4.0” was first coined at a trade fair organized in Hannover, Germany in 2011and  plays a vital role 
in every industry by not only changing the industrial or business processes but also developing new advanced 
technologies and applications for different processes. It is characterized as the integration of manufacturing and 
logistics cyber-physical systems, as well as the application of the Internet of Things in industrial processes.  
 
As technology advances and the number of smart devices continues to expand dramatically, the Internet of Things has 
been generated by the need for pervasive context-aware networks that enable an integrated, heterogeneous, and 
distributed device network. However, the incorporation and convergence of various information and research domains, 
covering aspects from recognition and communication to resource discovery and service integration, needs to pave 
the way for achieving the aforementioned goals and making the IoT paradigm more concrete. The connection between 
people and technology is rapidly changed by the Internet of Things (IoT). It is considered to be the next breakthrough 
technology, the implementation of the network through physical objects Internet access can bring many benefits to 
the potential prestige.

2178","37. Thus, the decision to adopt IoT was possible. Philippine manufacturing SMEs were willing to adopt digital 
applications without sensors, digital applications with sensors for process control, a remote monitoring system with 
production control. As reported in Business World by (Balinbin,2021), the Philippines was ranked 59th out of 79 
countries in the 2020 Global connectivity index (GCI) according to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. which suggest that 
the Philippines remained a starter in terms of digital transformation using Rajnai & Kocsis (2018) readiness assessment 
model, the strategy for the new entrant in digital transformation must prompt a willing attitude. Moreover, according 
to the study of Grufman et al (2020), beginners should do studies towards industry 4.0 and have systems that are 
compatible with industry 4.0 technologies and should have a little competence in its organization and IT security.  
 
4. Theoretical and Practical Implications 
In this study, researchers focused on profitability and ROI, and initial investments for the financial factor of adopting 
IoT, ease of management, supply chain visibility, risks, and organizational inertia for the organizational factors in 
adopting IoT and willingness for digitalization readiness factor. However, the researchers failed to describe some 
indicators in much detailed or much measurable form. Also, the researchers only had limited willing respondents in 
manufacturing SMEs from different manufacturing segments which the researchers believed it affected the focus of 
the study. For the future researchers, the researchers suggest studying a manufacturing segment focused and/or top 3 
manufacturing segment focus to come up with a more accurate plan in adopting IoT in Philippine manufacturing 
SMEs. There was a possibility that the Philippine manufacturing SMEs can adopt IoT in their operations. The key 
was that the decision-makers must have a willingness in adopting IoT and must focus on the driving forces such as 
profitability and ROI, ease of management, supply chain visibility and organizational inertia for the restraining forces. 
Using force field analysis helped determine the strength of each force internally in order to determine the likelihood 
of adopting IoT. Using SEM analysis helps to determine the relationship of each factor externally.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This study analyzed the significant factors that drive the Philippine manufacturing SMEs in adopting IoT in their 
operations using structural equation modeling (SEM) and Force Field Analysis. The use of SEM indicates that 
Profitability and ROI (PR), Ease of Management (EM), Supply Chain Visibility (SCV), and Organizational Inertia 
(OI) had significance in adopting IoT in manufacturing SMEs in the Philippines. Also, willingness to adopt IoT had 
a significance in determining the IoT adoption. Using force field analysis indicates that Philippine manufacturing 
SMEs can likely adopt IoT in their operations. However, as for the willingness, they remained neutral for adopting 
sensors for operating conditions, and cloud systems, and big data analytics. This study suggests future researchers dig 
deeper into how manufacturing SMEs can gain competitive advantage by applying IoT in their operations to (1) 
minimize cost, (2) improve quality control, and (3) minimize waste after prompting the willingness of the 
manufacturing SMEs in adopting IoT. The current findings can be used to guide the focus of the Philippine 
manufacturing SMEs in adopting IoT in their operations.

Abstract 
 
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally and its impact cause 
many brick-and-mortar retailers including grocery stores to develop different strategies to operate amidst pandemic 
which includes revamping the area of facility management and layout, systems design and retail marketing. The 
objective of the study is (1) determine the relationship between the perceived COVID-19 effects and the buying 
expectations and preference of grocery customers, (2) determine the significance of the New Normal grocery 
operations strategy elements and practices and its moderating effect on the grocery customer buying expectations and 
preferences in view of the Covid-19 repercussions and (3) recommend a grocery operations strategy implementation 
platform to address the new buying preferences and expectations of grocery customers toward the new normal. With 
a sample size of 303 respondents of various individual that have experience buying grocery during pandemic answered 
the online questionnaire. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the result of the study showed that the COVID-
19 effect have direct significant to the buying expectations and preference of grocery customers. Additionally the New 
Normal grocery operations strategy elements and practices also have significant direct effect to the buying 
expectations and preference of grocery customers.

1.   Introduction 
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally and its impact on 
daily life continues to increase as individuals, government and businesses need to respond and consider measures 
to mitigate the risk of infection, assess the potential impact, and develop plans. Affected countries, like the 
Philippines, immediately conducted contact tracing, imposed a travel ban, and declared community quarantine for 
cities with a high incidence of Covid-19 cases (Amit et al., 2020). 
 
This quarantine consisted of social distancing; travel ban; temporary closure of non-essential business 
establishments; encouragement of work-from-home arrangements; and prohibition of mass gatherings and non-
essential public events. As the number of positive cases increased, the government implemented stricter home 
quarantine measures in all households, suspension in all forms of public transportation, regulation of the provision 
for food and essential health services; imposition of curfew hours; and selective allowance of commercial and retail 
establishments. Empirical evidence from few selected economies suggested that these measures have been effective 
in flattening the pandemic ""curve"" and significantly reducing the number of fatalities (Amit et al., 2020; Kraemer 
et al., 2020). 
 
Containment measures to halt the spread of COVID-19 and limiting the number of fatalities has a very large adverse 
impact on transit mobility, trade, and retail that resulted in large short-term economic losses (Deb et al., 2020). The 
retail sector continues to be in a challenging environment brought about by COVID-19 and its immediate impact on 
the sector is the overall reduced spending, except for the essentials. This resulted in the decline in sales for retailers, 
but except for retailers of essential goods, groceries, and supermarkets which experienced an increase in demand

2191","Another recommendation that can be applied to grocery stores in Metro Manila, Philippines is called a curbside 
pick-up. According to an article ""Is curbside pickup just getting started?"" by RetailWire, it has been happening in 
the United States by major chains like Walmart, Best Buy, Dick's, etc. According to an article in Cowen & 
Co.  Avoiding in-store navigation, skipping the checkout line, and not needing to dig for goods in the store are all 
advantages of curbside pickup. This operation has been applied to some food and clothing retail stores in the 
Philippines but not at grocery stores.  The following are the procedure for the curbside pick-up.  
 
Step 1: Consumers will choose the groceries online on their app or website. 
Step 2: The consumer will park in the designated area of the chosen store 
Step 3: Scan a QR code to check-in and text through the app that will notify the grocery store that the customer 
has arrived 
Step 4: Wait for personnel to bring the bought products to their car. 
 
The curbside pick-up method and the home delivery method have more marginal utilities and are more convenient 
to customers, who then need less time and effort to collect groceries while maintaining physical distance from 
other people, according to Grashuis et al (2020). It is also supported by Gawor & Hoberg (2019), who find great 
utility associated with the home delivery method as compared to the in-store pick-up method in a choice 
experimented with online consumers of electronics in the United States. One major issue while grocery shopping 
is that customers tend to touch most of the products which can lead to the spread of the disease. This system will 
help avoid customers from entering the facility where grocery stores can easily control the people who will have 
contact with the products and can easily sanitize the products being sold. 
 
For future researchers, further studies can be addressed on how grocery stores in the Philippines can adjust to the 
four main phases of community quarantine which are modified general community quarantine (MGCQ), modified 
enhanced community quarantine (MECQ), general community quarantine (GCQ) and enhanced community 
quarantine (ECQ) and if the strategies made during quarantine are still applicable after the pandemic. 
 
4.   Conclusion 
Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2) is a pandemic that affected the daily life of 
individuals, government, and business operations. Containment measures to halt the spread of the virus resulted in 
social distancing, self-isolation, travel restriction, curfew, reduced workforce across all economic sectors, and 
caused many jobs to be lost which sparked fear of impending economic crisis and recession globally. Brick-and-
mortar retailers like supermarkets and groceries struggle to maintain revenue streams due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. With this, retailers develop different strategic approaches to survive. 
 
The general result of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicates that the effect of COVID-19 had significant 
direct effects on the grocery customer buying preference and expectation. Grocery stores have been put under strain 
as a result of people's panic buying and stockpiling of food. The researchers identified a strategy to interpret the 
SEM results. First, identify the significant factors in the standardized regression weights, since all of the results 
shown are up to the standard it is all significant. Next, choose high factor loadings in each latent presented to 
identify what the researchers will address in the study. The latent is COVID-19 effects, Grocery Store Operation 
Strategy and Practices, and Grocery Customer Buying Preferences and Expectations. Researchers chose factor 
loadings that are higher than 0.4 since it is the standard for it to be significant. The following chosen factor loading 
are: P1 (0.612), P2 (0.747), P5 (0.732), FL2 (0.768), FL4 (0.795), SD2 (0.585), PRE2 (0.563), EXP3 (0.757), and 
EXP5 (0.862). These results show that the recommended operations strategy to the new buying preference and 
expectations of grocery customers toward the new normal are addressed.  
 
Interestingly, the operations strategy and practices that grocery stores develop to cope up with pandemic have a 
significant direct effect on the grocery customer's buying preference and expectation. This includes changing and 
developing strategies in the area of facility management and layout, systems design, and retail marketing. 
 
Results of the SEM indicate that strategy under protocols should be given importance since customers want their 
safety prioritized. Facility management and layout of the grocery store are also addressed since customers prefer 
going to grocery stores to buy their needs and necessities, this way facility layout should be given attention. It

creating one-way aisle, manning fresh goods to minimize contact, proper display of in-demand products like

Abstract 
 
The millennial generation, also known as Gen Y, Gen Next, Echo Boomers, and the Baby-on-Board Generation, 
accounts for over 47.1% in the Philippines, implying a constitute a sizable portion of the workforce. The general 
business problem is that shortage and turnover of employees negatively affect a company’s operations. The current 
study utilized a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach to understand the Millennials’ job expectations and 
allow company leaders to attract and retain Millennial Generation employees, who, on average, stay at their jobs for 
1.5 years. A total of 266 Filipino Millennials answered the survey questionnaire that was distributed online. The 
results of the SEM indicated that organizations’ management policies and initiatives had the most significant direct 
effect on the Filipino Millennials’ engagement and satisfaction. Furthermore, Filipino Millennials’ career 
expectations also had a significant direct effect on the engagement and satisfaction. Hence, maintaining employee 
engagement and satisfaction is a win-win strategy, since employees feel fulfilled when given meaningful work, and 
the organization becomes more efficient in achieving its goals. The result of this study could be used as a reference 
for policymakers of the companies who wish to improve job satisfaction and employee engagement of Filipino 
Millennials in the workforce. Furthermore, this study can be applied to evaluate the factors affecting job satisfaction 
and engagement in other industries or countries.

1. Introduction  
 
The millennial generation, also known as Gen Y, Gen Next, Echo Boomers, and the Baby-on-Board Generation 
(Twenge et al., 2010), accounts for roughly one-third of the overall population in the United States, implying that 
they already constitute a sizable portion of the workforce (Rappler, 2015). In the Philippines, over 42 million 
Filipinos aged 15 years and above were in the workforce, with 47.1 percent of Filipino millennials aged 15-34 
constituting the labor force. Indeed, the workforce will be dominated for the next decade or more by three 
generations: Baby Boomers, Generation X, and the Millennial Generation (Mencl & Lester, 2014). The millennial 
generation is the most recent to enter the workforce, and they have unique preferences, expectations, and demands in 
comparison to preceding generations (Kapoor & Solomon, 2011). According to Khalid et al. (2013) and Heneman et 
al. (2014), Millennials have a higher rate of turnover than previous generations, and high turnover rates might 
deprive an organization of valuable talent, so impairing the organization's capacity to achieve its goals. 
 
Deloitte (2016) reported that millennials in emerging markets such as the Philippines are the least loyal to their 
organizations. Additionally, millennials do not pursue the same job paths as their predecessors. According to the 
Deloitte Millennial Study, 40% of Filipino Millennials intend to quit within two years, whereas 64% of Filipino 
Echo Boomers intend to quit their current employer within the next four years. According to Deloitte's sixth global 
Millennial Survey, Millennials, on average, demonstrate little commitment to their companies, and many are 
anticipating near-term departure. According to the survey, millennials feel underutilized and believe their potential 
is being squandered. Fausto, like Deloitte, cites a Maybank study that indicates the average job term of a Millennial 
is 1.6 years. According to the report, Millennials are not loyal to the business for which they work, but rather to the

2203",,"The result of this study could be used as a reference for policymakers of the companies who wish to improve job 
satisfaction and employee engagement of Filipino Millennials in the workforce. Furthermore, this study can be 
applied to evaluate the factors affecting job satisfaction and engagement in other industries or countries.  
 
4.1 Limitations and Future Research 
 
One of the study's limitations is its dependence on cross-sectional data and self-report questionnaires. As a result, 
future research on this topic should take a mixed-methods approach. Since job satisfaction and engagement are 
critical components of employee morale, they should also be evaluated from a human resource standpoint. Thus, 
future studies should incorporate the expanding topic of engagement and satisfaction as a management practice. 
Since these findings are conducted on a limited sampling of millennial employees currently residing in Metro 
Manila, no universal claim of applicability can be made. Other significant elements affecting job satisfaction and 
employee engagement can be investigated in the future, including job characteristics, turnover intentions, 
organizational commitment, family duties, and obligations.

Abstract 
 
Robotic systems are a combination of actuators and control systems for manipulating a tool or end effector 
along a specified path. Different types of actuators exist for different applications like bio mimicking, 
rehabilitation and prosthesis, and are classified based on their principle of actuation. These actuators include 
Serial Elastic Actuators, Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), Dielectric Elastomer Actuator (DEA), fluidic 
actuation etc. Various robotic systems have been developed with different actuators. SEA are conventional 
electric actuators are coupled with flexible elements. The main purpose is the introduction of compliance. 
Smart materials like SMA, Soft actuators like DEA and Flexible Elastomer Actuators using Fluidic 
actuation principles, pertaining to their actuation principles, can be used for biomimicking applications and 
their compliance nature due to their flexibility results in better shock absorbing and energy recovery 
capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey relating to various actuators and their 
applications. A brief review of use of EMG and EEG as control systems is also presented in this article. 
Mathematical formulations have also been summarized in this article.

Abstract 
Gemba Kaizen is used successfully by manufacturing organizations that supply Toyota South Africa (TSAM) 
with finished auto part. The paper seeks to establish how TSAM and its suppliers have used this Kaizen tool. The 
principle has been used in four stages namely going to Gemba where the manager physically goes to the 
production line floor. At the manufacturing floor the manager checks the whole process (machines, materials, 
tools, rejects), in order to identify for Muda and rejects. When the waste is identified, a temporary measure to 
stop the waste is quickly devised and installed to allow production to continue whilst a team of engineers is 
analysing ways of removing the root cause. When the solution is obtained they implement it and standardize the 
process establishing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Gemba reduces the lead-time, rejects, and Muda in 
the production line whilst improving quality.

The Gemba Kaizen improvements reduce the effort, shorten the process time, improve quality, reduce material 
input and above all bring job satisfaction to employees. TSAM and its suppliers have been so successful in LM 
because its employees are satisfied and interested in improving their performance and effectiveness. Job 
satisfaction help retain employees at one company but may migrate from one sister company to another for better 
rewards, upgrading and recognition.  
Learning experiences in the Gemba are based on appreciation of fundamental human values, such a respect for 
humanity, commitment, determination, economy (sensible use of resources), cleanliness, and order. The best 
learning experience you can get is the one you gain through practicing, using your body, and learning by doing. 
Look, see, think and act hence implementing Gemba walk to see the anomaly, find and eliminate the root cause. 
 
A Gemba walk is not an opportunity to find fault in others or a time to enforce policy adherence except for 
safety problems or gross violations. It requires a mutual respect and interest approach to workers and their tasks. 
If ideas or complaints arise, note them and make a follow up after the walk but do not quickly focus on the 
details before seeing the whole production line. If the walk is punitive, employees may close doors and resist 
any change. Gemba walk is not used solve problems and make changes immediately, but to observe, get inputs 
and reflect?  
The study noticed that employees who leave TSAM go to its supplier as champions of Gemba or other Kaizens. 
A two-way migration of experienced personnel from the suppliers to TSAM and vice versa is prevalent. The 
migration happens mainly for promotion to fill senior management posts. TSAM and its suppliers does not 
dismiss employees but places the employee where he is best in the production line. 
Gemba Kaizen is driven by Teamwork and cross-functional teams, quality planning and control, employee 
awareness and training- team autonomy, productivity improvement, management support, goal difficulty, work 
area routineness, goal clarity, affective commitment to change, internal processes, team Gemba Kaizen 
experience, action orientation, functional heterogeneity and team leader experience.  All these are the drivers of 
productivity improvement through Gemba Kaizen.

Abstract 
 
Juice packaging design as a marketing strategy to children is becoming highly sophisticated, increasingly well-
funded, and takes place within the environment of other kinds of child-targeted marketing. The joint decision-
making process by both parents and children who are the consumers of these products are often influenced by 
nutritional concerns and price sensitivity for parents while children aim to fulfill spontaneous desires resulting from 
factors such as visual elements, package image, cartoon characters, colors etc.  Even with varieties of innovative 
juice packaging plaguing our markets today, issues such as little or no user experience, indecisive nature of kids 
picking just one flavor, and poor shelf life of packaging materials where tiny bit of oxygen penetration results in 
mold growth and unsustainability are yet to be fully addressed. This paper proposes a  juice packaging design 
solution that adopts polyethylene furanoate material for prolonged shelf life and reduced carbon footprint selected 
through relative performance index of key features, a dual chambered body design to accommodate both lead and 
fringe users indecisive nature, a pressure induced closing diaphragm beneath the bottle cap and an interactive 
labeling for improved user experience in an environmentally responsible way still relatively cheaper compared to 
current market competitions.

1. Introduction 
The role of packaging in a brand's overall communications cannot be over emphasized, particularly as the brand's 
principal spokesperson within the crowded shopping environment. To maximize its effectiveness for packaging 
targeted at children, it must exploit the entire pack format using Cartoon Characters, Package image, color, 
Incentives, and Visual elements. The criteria for developing the optimum packaging design must be based on clear 
communication of relevant brand values together with appropriate codes and triggers that will aid the purchase 
decision. Both must be developed with a view to what best fits the consumer's particular shopping mode within a 
specific market (Clark,1997). 
 
Children find nutritional information confusing and base their healthfulness judgements on visual cues of packages, 
such as colors or the presence of fruit images (Alejandra et al. 2020). Food packages targeted at children are usually 
designed using bright colors, cartoon characters, references to fun, sport and play, photos of celebrities, and tie-ins 
with movies or TV programs. Several marketing techniques are used to target products at children, including 
advertising, sponsorship, promotions, merchandising, and packaging (Alejandra et al. 2020). 
 
Regarding interactivity versus aesthetics, there exist a gender difference as Interest in a food’s interactivity was 
substantially more pronounced for boys, whereas girls (particularly the older ones generally focus on the aesthetic 
qualities of food as seen in [G5/6]) controlled experiment in (Clark,1997). This negates a consensus “when things 
look fancier, they taste worse” as to preferences made by the girl child. Restrictions on marketing strategies of foods 
targeted at children have been implemented in different countries, but only to a limited extent and not very 
comprehensive due to misguided marketing strategies that tend to hide information relating to products that contain

5. Conclusion   
The aim of this research has been designing and developing a user centric interactive low cost and environmentally 
friendly juice packaging for children. The dual chambered bottle body made from PEF prolongs shelf life, 4.2 Vol. 
CO2 Shelf life to -17.5% (wks), reduces carbon footprint as it is fully recyclable being 100% biobased. Dual 
chambered also implies that juice producers can now have different kinds of flavors all fitted in one container which 
helps solve the problem of indecisive nature of kids as to which flavor to forgo as they can now have both choices. 
The adoption of cartoon character figures in the design of the bottle cap with a pressure induced diaphragm drives 
home the interactivity between product and target end users which we hoped to achieve.

Abstract 
 
Even the green concept precisely addresses the environmental unfriendliness in the construction industry, its 
adaptation still has barriers and issues. Green buildings have often involved the implementation of different success 
factors by construction professionals such as designers, project managers, contractors and quantity surveyors in order 
to overcome the difficulties and to ensure success in the delivery of green buildings. For instance, integration in the 
project delivery process enables the project participants to interact seamlessly to achieve better sustainable outcomes. 
Greater communication among project participants, particularly through multiple communication means contribute to 
success in the delivery of green buildings. It is found that various techniques of Artificial Intelligence have effectively 
contributed to the modernising of the construction industry through more reliable, automated, self-modifying, time-
saving, and cost-effective process in construction management. Hence, this paper intends to bring in literature 
synthesis addressing applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques to enhance green construction through 
overcoming the barriers and issues in communication within green construction. Ultimately a conceptual framework 
is developed to understand the applicability of the AI in communication in green construction.

Introduction 
Even though the world is leading towards great achievements all the time in terms of physical development and 
facilitating the quality of life, it is questionable whether all kinds of living creatures are protected in this state of 
environment (Hossain and Ng 2019). The depletion of Ozon layer, ascending of global warming day by day, 
deforestation and adverse climatic changes have become huge environmental tragedies (Hussin et al. 2013). 
Construction industry performs a vital role in the global economy that contributes to the global GDP by 13% (Hossain 
and Ng 2019). Hence, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the output of such a wide-spread industry 
throughout the world. Typically, it satisfies the need of building and infrastructure development to facilitate the 
necessities of human beings (Enshassi et al. 2014). Unfortunately, construction industry does not only play an 
important role in the global economy, but it also generates adverse consequences towards social and environmental 
aspects (Hussin et.al 2013).  The construction activities influence the environment substantially across a wide range 
of off-site and on-site activities (Shen and Tam 2002). Accordingly, the construction activities negatively influence 
on environment through the mining of environmental resources such as fossil fuels and minerals; the growth in the 
use of generic resources such as soil, water, air and energy; the production of waste requiring land use for disposal; 
and contamination of the natural ecosystem with noise, odours, dust, vibrations, chemical and particulate pollutants, 
and solids (Shen and Tam 2002). In global scale, the construction industry is responsible for 40 per cent of energy 
consumption, 30 per cent of CO2 emissions and 40 per cent of total solid production waste (CRI 2014). The adverse 
impact created by the construction industry on the environment has been discussed and researched to suggest solutions 
to overcome (Hussin et.al 2013). The concept of green has directly addressed the environmental unfriendliness of the 
construction industry (Glavinich 2008). A green building can be identified as a building that in its design, construction, 
operation, maintenance, renovation and demolition minimise or eliminates adverse impacts, and can form and 
maximise positive impacts, on the climate and natural environment (Zuo and Zhao 2014).

Abstract 
 
This research aims to evaluates the relationship between Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) rating and firm 
credit rating. The study focuses on listed companies in Indonesia and tries to examine the relationship using ordered 
probit regression model to reach conclusion of this study. The findings show from three pillars of ESG, only 
environment and governance significantly affect firm credit rating. Specifically, firm credit ratings are negatively 
associated with environment pillar and positively related with governance pillar. This research also documents that 
individual categories of each ESG pillar possess different significance and effect.  This research results show that 
resource use, emission, human rights, management, and shareholders significantly affect firm credit rating. However, 
only emission and management possess positive effect. The overall research shows ESG rating as a non-financial 
information plays a huge role in creditworthiness assessment.

1. Introduction 
Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) as an investment nature that considers environment, social and governance 
(ESG) factors to generate long-term return and positive impact to the society have increased rapidly over the last few 
years. More than one out of every four dollars investment was invested in sustainable investing strategies and a 38% 
growth rate in sustainable investing from 2016 to 2018 (US SIF, 2019). To cope with the increasing trend of 
sustainable investing, Financial Service Authority (OJK) in Indonesia released a regulation no.51/POJK.03/2017 on 
sustainability report obligations for financial services, listed and public companies to assure that they meet 
sustainability-related criteria to attract wider investors.  
 
Sustainable and Responsible Investment KEHATI (SRI KEHATI), United Nation Principles of Responsible 
Investment (UNPRI), The Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (US SIF), Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI), European Sustainable investment (Eurosif) and many others are all indicators in addressing sustainability in 
financial market in order to create a better and sustainable future. All these development of initiatives, indicators and 
values are pushing the way companies need to operate to become more sustainable. In countries like Indonesia for 
example where sustainability reports become an obligation, it is crucial for every business to address ESG in their 
operations. Since ESG as a sustainability aspect is now required to be integrated with corporate’s operation and 
become something they need to consider in conducting their businesses, it is reasonable to assume that ESG as a 
sustainability factor affects their financial performance. 
 
Even though there is already an excess amount of literature and research on the sustainability aspect, especially its 
relationship with firm performances that yields contradicting results. The effect of sustainability aspect on credit rating 
has not been developed much. One thing to underline is that previous research tends to be on the advanced countries, 
while the research on developing countries is still very limited. This is due to the allocation of resources that focus 
more on operating efficiency rather than values like socially responsible investment. Even though Indonesia is 
categorized as a developing country, Indonesia is becoming more aware as the regulation on sustainability report 
become an obligation for the company and its assertiveness in dealing with ESG violations on the court.  
 
ESG factors have been proven to be the judgement for the risk perspective. The risk of ESG violation as their 
sustainability aspect will result in substantial penalty to cover the violations cost and the damage corporations have

z-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * represent statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 % levels, respectively. 
 
First, comparing the Pseudo-R2 with our previous analysis in Table 1 model 2 –which will be the comparison for this 
final model, has decreased slightly from 0.517 to 0.5007, meaning there’s a different explanatory power between the 
previous model and the final model because of the variables elimination. Even though the explanatory power has 
decreased, the difference is only 1% between the two models, it shows that the insignificant variables doesn’t add 
much explanatory power to firm and proven to had so little effect on the firm credit rating.  
 
Consistent with our main model shown in Table 1 model 2, environment pillar has a significant and negative effect 
at 1% level indicating firms with higher environmental score reduces firm credit rating and more likely in the lower 
credit rating category. Like before, Hypothesis 1 (H1). “There is a significant positive relationship between 
environment pillar and firm credit rating” is rejected due to its negative effect on firm credit rating. This result is 
consistent with Table 2 discussing individual environmental categories that possess negative effect and significantly 
affect firm credit rating. Next, still consistent with our model 2 in Table 1 and align with previous research (Ashbaugh-
Skaife, Collins, & LaFond, 2006; Bhojraj & Sengupta, 2003), governance pillars has a significant and positive 
coefficient at 5% level impacting firm credit rating, indicating firms with higher governance score reduce risk on firm 
creditworthiness which leads to the acceptance of Hypothesis 3 (H1). “There is a significant positive relationship 
between governance pillar and firm credit rating”.  
 
Highly consistent with our previous model that shows control variables have greater impact, Size shows a positive 
coefficient of 0.0285 that is slightly higher than the previous model 2 in Table 1 of 0.026 at 1% level, but the difference 
on both coefficient is very low of 0.002 which tell us the model is highly consistent. indicating firm with larger size 
facing lower risk of default due to its higher ability to pay its obligation result in more likely of a higher category of 
credit rating.  Margin possess positive and significant effect. The coefficient on both model are the same of 4.7 which 
also show high consistency, indicating firm with higher operating profit face lower probability of bankruptcy and 
more likely in a higher category of credit rating. However this variables on both model still only shows the significance 
on 5% level instead of 1%.  
 
Coefficient on CAPINT has significant and positive effect on firm credit rating with approximately 2.071 which is 
slightly lower than the previous model of 2.231, indicating firms with higher capital intensity are expected with higher 
credit rating and more likely in a higher rating category with such a high effect.  Beta still show negative coefficient 
of -1.030 that is slightly lower than the one in the previous model of -0.979 on firm credit rating, suggesting higher 
equity risk results in lower credit rating. The other variables: Leverage, Coverage and Loss possess insignificant 
impact on firm creditworthiness. Therefor these variables would not be analyzed further in the discussion. After 
running the final regression model, the coefficient of each significant variables are known. Therefore, the final 
regression equation is 
Probit(CreditRating) = -0.0275 ENV + 0.0237 GOV + 0.0285 SIZE + 4.707 MARGIN +        2.0714 CAPINT –

5. Conclusion  
This research is intended to analyse the relationship between ESG rating and firm credit rating of Indonesian firms. 
Companies with lower ESG should pay a higher cost of capital since corporations who violate ESG comes with 
substantial fines and long term financial effect, the probability of default is higher for those firms with ESG violation 
with long term impact and financial loss on their financial performance. Researcher tested this argument using ESG 
rating of individual pillars and firm credit rating data over the period of 2015 –2019 using ordered probit regression 
model. Our research shows that environmental pillar negatively affecting firm credit rating and firms with higher 
environmental score tends to have lower credit rating, social pillar possesses positive effect on firm credit rating but 
is insignificant, which later will be eliminated due to the insignificance effect. Lastly governance pillar possesses a 
significant and positive effect on firm credit rating.  
 
Aside from these results, researcher finds not all individual ESG categories are significant and relevant to firm’s credit 
rating. Specifically, researcher finds that resource use, emission, human rights, management, and shareholders

possess negative effect on firm credit rating while half of the categories are statistically insignificant: environmental 
innovation possess a positive effect, community development and involvement has positive effect, product 
responsibility has negative effect, workforce conditions is positive, and CSR possess negative effect, therefor not 
included in the final model. These results suggest by implementing a good corporate governance, firms are more likely 
to have a higher credit rating, which also equal to enhancing firm and shareholders’ value. In contrary, investment in 
environment pillar will result in lower credit rating and more likely to increase firm’s financing costs, which the firms 
should be avoided. Lastly, Investment in social pillar doesn’t have a significant impact on firm credit rating.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of the research is aimed to fill that gap whilst also furthering the knowledge and understanding 
as a whole within the context of using influencers for a non-profit organizations’ campaign. The focus on influencers’ 
usage would also help raise the number of donations (in any currency) for every new, growing or even bigger NPOs 
in these competitive eras. Overall, this research is mainly focused on the NPOs' perspective towards how influencers 
become a tool that leverage marketing communication campaigns to achieve NPOs’ sales and the impacts that 
influencers can bring to an NPOs marketing campaign. To attain the objectives of this exploratory research, a 
qualitative approach by interview will be implemented. This will be done by collecting data through a semi-structured 
interview with NPOs to identify themes and explain patterns. The researcher has determined the key informants, which 
are a person from a marketing team from NPOs, people who work and or involved in an NPO and or handles the 
building of the NPO and marketing or marketing communication division in Indonesia. The NPOs are moving in the 
sector of education, children, poverty, social/public health, environment and environmental sustainability. The study 
findings help small and growing NPOs to obtain a maximum result in their sales which is their donations and for them 
to be able to adjust the current marketing communications conditions in the society to invent trust and understanding 
for donors.   This correlated with helping the country (Indonesia’s) betterment in social problems.

1. Introduction 
As a platform that offers unlimited access to a huge amount of information from all over the world, social 
media has become a big part of its users (Bianchiet al., 2017). It has shaped marketing strategies and trends. As a 
result, marketers started perceiving a Social Media Marketing Campaign as one of the key channels to communicate 
and interact with customers through social media platforms (Pentina et al., 2018). Literature has generally emphasized 
the adoption of campaigns can be regarded as an important instrument for achieving competitive advantages and 
enhancing organizational efficiency (Kohli and Jaworski, 1990; Narver and Slater, 1990; Jaworski and Kohli, 1993). 
The organizational trends have also seen strong growth in recent decades, especially the non-profit organizations 
sector, showing proof of the urgency for the society (Salamon and Anheier, 1999). Happens in the field, NPOs have 
a variety of functions, assuming the extraordinary set of organisational types and embrace a broad range of industry 
sectors. These developments give consequences yet challenges for the management of NPOs, to increase their 
marketing activities and strategies (Kendall and Knapp, 1995). Followed, a social media marketing campaign is a 
coordinated marketing effort to help deliver information that results in measurable outcomes and influences people 
who receive it to feel or act in a certain way that can help the conditions mentioned (Bellefalmme et al., 2014).  
Though, until this point, there is a lack of studies tackling how the measurable outcomes are affected by other 
social and influential factors such as the influencers. Meanwhile, many happened in the field, a non-profit managers 
“realize that their mission on relying onto the good ideas of campaigns are vanished at the moment where the other 
organizations use the same idea with influencers and social power, they are more successful in reaching numbers of 
donations” (Andreasen and Kotler, 2003, p. 5). This present work draws on a conceptual framework to examine the 
effects of influencers that included social power towards the Social Media Marketing Campaign that an NPO made. 
Based on The CAF World Giving Index 2018, Indonesia placed in the first rank of the most generous and giving

2292","5. Conclusion  
A non-profit organization has been playing a vital role for a country, especially in Indonesia, with numerous 
cases of social problems, from hunger, needs of education, environmental issues until health, and with the existence 
of an NPO has helped the government to at least solve the unsolved problem in the society. Non-profits are typically 
organised around a social mission and provide donations for a problem they will solve (Quarter and Richmond, 2001) 
and in this context, Acar et al. (2001) discovered that non-profit organisations prioritise their social obligations 
considerably more than for-profit organisations. Then in those conditions, many people admit knowing little or nothing 
about how charitable organisations are organised and operated, according to surveys (Ipsos MORI Social Research 
Institute, 2008). With that, building what is called awareness before leading to numerous donations is proven very 
important. 
From the result of data analysis, the roles of influencers and people with social power have shown their 
effective result in gaining exposure, campaign’s virality, driving it into a trend and turning it into numerous 
engagement and awareness. This indicated that society should be provided by the feeling of trust before donating 
and  the feeling of understanding and or emphatize the problem that will be solved. Especially in this digital era, it is 
also important to have an online existence in order to spread the information and communication fast and provide E-
Words of Mouth. Combined with the matched link of previous research about a successful campaign and what 
happened in the field when finding donors, made it stronger that the usage of influencers and people with social power 
has given a positive impact to the number of donations.

Abstract 
Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of objects using the internet that are equipped with sensors and 
communication technology. IoT Technology is a new paradigm envisioned as a global network of machines 
and devices capable of communicating with each other. This project presents using the agent-based model 
to simulate the behaviors of IoT electric meters. A case study was proposed to investigate the applicability 
of utilizing IoT technology in Saudi Electricity Company (SEC). The agent-based model was built using 
AnyLogic software. Two different scenarios were applied, and simulation outputs were analyzed to 
recognize the importance of adopting IoT technology at SEC.

Introduction  
The main activity of the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) is producing and distributing electricity 
within Saudi Arabia. SEC was established in 2000. The company is considered the principal 
generator of electricity and the only holder of the entire distribution network throughout the 
country, helping all kinds of clients. However, the current electric meter used widely in SEC has 
many flaws such as reading errors and delay in issuing electric bills since the reading of the meter 
is operated manually. Therefore, IoT technology can be applied to overcome these difficulties. 
This technology provides real-time data on electricity and helps to optimize the distribution of 
energy. The IoT electric meter can enhance the client service through the valuable insights and 
information obtained from the meter data. The purpose of this research is to investigate the 
applicability of applying IoT technology in SEC by simulating the behaviors of the electric meter 
using agent-based modeling.  
 
This paper has four sections. Section 1 includes the introduction and Section 2 covers some 
background of agent-based simulation. Section 3 presents a case study from SEC. Finally, the 
limitation and the future works are addressed in the last section.

 Agent-Based Modeling  
Agent-based simulation is an approach to solve difficulties of systems consist of objects (Gilbert, 
2007). In the beginning, it was applied in the study of cellular automata (Richiardi, 2014). Agent-
based simulation has gained more interest in the last decade (Macal & North, 2009). Agents can 
be used to study the behaviors of different objects such as markets and customers which makes 
this type of simulation very helpful nowadays (Railsback & Grimm, 2019).

Abstract 
 
Celebrity endorsement through social media has wide ranging implications on businesses particularly because 
celebrities have the power to influence consumer behavior. In the fashion industry, celebrity endorsement has had a 
huge impact on consumer purchase intentions and firms are using this approach to leverage market share. Social media 
platforms are being increasingly used by celebrities to market fashion brands in Sri Lanka and this has become a new 
trend. This paper seeks to identify the influence of celebrity endorsement through social media on consumer 
purchasing intentions in the Sri Lankan fashion industry. Although, there is considerable research on celebrity 
endorsement through social media, there is limited research of such practices in the fashion industry in Sri Lanka. The 
research methodology is a deductive, cross sectional study that uses quantitative research methods. The sample size 
of 300 customers was selected through convenience sampling and the research instrument was developed through 
prior research instruments by products. The main findings revealed that expertise, trustworthiness, fame, personality, 
and attractiveness of a celebrity positively influenced perceived consumer purchase intentions. The main limitations 
of the study are that it does not identify the specific social media platforms which are more influential.

1. Introduction 
Social media usage has increased due to the growth of Web 2.0 which creates opportunities for businesses to maximize 
market share and profitability through customer acquisition (Soegoto, and Utomo, 2019). Using social media 
platforms and websites to promote a product or service is called social media marketing (Shareef et al., 2019). 
Businesses and brands have recently turned to an online ‘celebrity’ known as a social media influencer (SMI) to 
disseminate information and influence consumer product perception. This has become a common tactic in 
communication and marketing efforts, especially with the fashion and beauty industry (Liyanage, 2019). ""Influencing"" 
is now an important source of revenue for celebrities, and celebrities use their fame, publicity, or social status to 
market a product, brand, or service, or to increase information awareness about a problem (Chung, and Cho 2017). In 
the fashion industry, brands are now hiring celebrities to influence people to buy their fashion items (Carrillat, 
O’Rourke, and Plourde, 2019).  
 
1.1 Research Gap 
The impact of celebrity endorsement in social media and in TV commercials on customer purchasing intentions in 
perfumes, telecommunication, beauty, and skin care products (Liyanage, 2019; Munasinghe et al., 2020; Guruge, 
2018; Zipporah, and Mberia, 2014; Priyankara et al., 2017; Ertugan, and Mupindu, 2019) has received considerable 
attention. Globally considerable attention has been paid to celebrity endorsement through social media on consumer 
purchasing intentions in the fashion industry (Eli-Zafoe, 2013; Spry, Pappu, and Bettina, 2011; Khalid, Siddiqui, and

business online and increase their online market share.   
 
8.1 Recommendations  
Since celebrity endorsement on social media has a positive impact on perceived consumer purchase intentions, firms 
can use celebrities who have a large number of followers and who are able attract fans to endorse fashion brands since 
this improves customer acquisition. Future research studies could identify whether gender of the celebrity has an 
impact on perceived customer purchase intentions and whether different categories of celebrities have more impact 
than others on consumer purchase intentions.

1. Introduction 
 
The need for gelatin in Indonesia continues to increase, while there is no industry specifically producing gelatin 
so that imports of gelatin from several countries such as China, Australia, and several European countries continue to 
increase. According to Central Statistics data, imports of gelatin reached 2,715,782 kg with a value of 9,535,128 USD 
(BPS 2020). The use of gelatin is very wide in foodstuffs; as a gelling agent, thickener, emulsifier, foamer, and edible 
film, as well as in the pharmaceutical field (IMESON, 1992).  
So far, the main raw material for gelatin comes from the skin and bones of cows or pigs. The use of fishbone gelatin 
is acceptable to Muslims as is the majority of the population in Indonesia, and there are few restrictions on Judaism 
and Hinduism (Mariod, A. A., & Adam, H. F, 2013). There are concerns about the use of raw materials from cows 
due to livestock diseases such as anthrax and mad cow disease (Gudmundsson, 2002). Gelatin is obtained from the 
conversion of collagen which was naturally found in animal bones or skin. Fish bones can be sources of gelatin because 
contain about 18.6% of collagen from 19.86% of the organic protein complex (Da Trindade Alfaro, Simões Da Costa, 
Graciano Fonseca, & Prentice, 2009). Several studies have been carried out on extracting gelatin from catfish bones 
with various types of immersion solutions, extraction temperature, extraction pH, extraction time, as for change 
variable  (Liu, Han, & Guo, 2009), will affect the gelatin yield (Sanaei, Mahmoodani, See, Yusop, & Babji, 2013). In 
addition, the acid process is more profitable because it requires a shorter time and lowers costs. 
Gelatin can protect food from the migration of water vapor, oxygen, carbon dioxide, aroma, and lipids as 
antimicrobials for packaging materials by paper or edible films. The mishandling of food can food deterioration by 
bacteria. Escherichia coli one type of gram-positive bacteria that grows in freshwater, seawater, soil contaminated 
with feces (Besser et al., 1993). The edible film will perform a good antimicrobial if spices such as turmeric (Curcuma 
domestica Val), temulawak (Curcuma xanthoriza), galangal (Alpinia galangal L), and ginger (Zingiber officinale) 
are added (Widiyono et al., 2021). 
This research aims to study the efficacy of antimicrobial of catfish gelatin with turmeric on Escherichia coli to 
the shelflife of apples. Analyzed the property and the appearance of apples after 18 days with the support of an 
organoleptic.

CONCLUSION 
Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that the higher the concentration of turmeric extract in the 
composition of the edible film, the higher the effectiveness of the edible film as an antimicrobial packaging. From 
the proven by the testing of weight loss of apples within 20 days according to the data obtained, the uncovered 
apples (control) was 4.38% weight reduction, apples covered with edible films of catfish gelatin + turmeric extract

was1.44% d, and apples packed with a mixture of edible film gelatin + turmeric extract 10% was 1.18%.  
There was one thing that needs to be noticed that the addition of 10% turmeric causes more thick films so if 
applied commercially it would not be effective because the sheet was not flexible, even though it was able to 
withstand the Escherichia coli bacteria better than others. The darker yellow color appearance of the films with the 
10 % turmeric seems to need to be modified to be appeared brighter while still in good inhibition against bacteria. 
The thick and stiff of existing films were necessary to be added a food-safe plasticizer.

Abstract 
Previous studies show underrepresentation of minorities in STEM, but this project concentrates on comparing 
STEM interest between different demographic groups of high schoolers in the San Francisco Bay Area. Google 
Forms was used to distribute this survey, which asked participants to rate their interest in STEM from one through 
five and select which STEM subjects, or none, they were interested in. To analyze the results, the Kruskal-Wallis 
and the Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare general and career interest in STEM due to ordinal data and a 
slight negative skew, and the Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test was used to assess whether or not groups were 
underrepresented or overrepresented in their interest in a specific field of STEM, such as science or engineering. 
After obtaining the results of these tests, it was discovered that the demographic category of gender differed in both 
interest in the overall STEM field and in specific subjects, while the demographic category of race differed only in 
interest in the overall STEM field.

1. Introduction 
The growth in awareness about movements such as Black Lives Matter (Michaels 2020) has resulted in increased 
awareness about societal inequalities. One area of inequality is the multidisciplinary field of STEM, which stands 
for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In STEM, some groups are overrepresented, such as men, 
Asian and White people, and other groups are underrepresented, such as women, Black, and Hispanic people (Fry, et 
al. 2021). In prominent technology companies, such as Facebook, Apple, and Google, women, Black, Hispanic or 
Latinx, and Multiracial people are underrepresented in areas of Research and Development. Because of 
underrepresentation in the field, studies have shown that technology discriminates against racial minorities 
(Bacchini and Ludovica 2019). For example, studies found that in one case, facial recognition technology works best 
for white men (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018), and in another case, technology used by judges to set parole was 
biased against black defendants (Ali, et al. 2010).  
 
The increasing disinterest in STEM starts in primary and secondary education (Saw, et al. 2018), where societal 
messages often demotivate underrepresented demographic groups to steer away from STEM (Hutchinson 2015), and 
certain fields in STEM are considered more “masculine” or more “feminine” due to lack of representation in media 
and mentors (Cheryan 2016). By collecting data about high school students’ interest in STEM and comparing 
demographic interest, schools will be able to identify and fix some of the problems of the current educational system 
through actions such as setting up mentoring, academic advising, curriculum reform, and opportunities to help 
students pursue passions in their desired fields (Tsui 2007). These actions should target specific demographic groups 
to help make the workforce is diverse and more representative of the actual population, making future innovations 
and inventions less biased and accessible to all.

safe to assume that what a student is interested in is not necessarily their desired career pursuit. 
4. Conclusions 
Even though Bay Area high school students display an interest in STEM, this project has found that there are still 
differences in interest in STEM between minorities. In general interest for the overall STEM field, tests found that 
demographic categories in gender exhibited a statistically significant difference, namely men and genderqueer 
students. However, when testing for career interest, race and gender were both found to have statistically significant 
differences among their respective categories. In race, Asian and White people had a higher interest than Black 
people, and Asians had a higher interest than White people.  
 
When examining the distribution of responses for specific subjects, for both general and career interest, only gender 
had a statistically significant result. For general interest, the chi-square goodness of fit test returned a statistically 
significant result for technology and engineering. For career interest, the test resulted in statistically significant 
results for technology and math. Women and Gender Non-Conforming people are still falling behind in interest 
compared to men. 
 
What was also interesting to note was the lack of statistical significance in other categories, such as between women 
and men in both general and career interest in STEM, specific subject interest for race, all types of interest for 
economic stress, and the lack of statistical significance for the category of science. 
 
Therefore, even though there are still inequalities in interest in STEM present in Bay Area high school students, 
demographic groups that had statistically significant relationships in previous studies were not statistically 
significant in this study. The lack of statistical significance could indicate that previously underrepresented 
demographic groups did not have differences in interest from demographic groups that are overrepresented, which 
may lead to a more proportional distribution of workers from all demographic categories. Through this study, 
demographic areas that need more resources have been identified, and initiatives can be implemented in areas with 
high concentrations of these demographic groups to boost interest in STEM.  
5. Future Research 
Future investigations could include looking into a specific demographic, such as race or gender, and probing into 
more of the factors that result in the statistically significant differences among demographics such as race and 
gender, such as previous exposure to STEM or family members in STEM. Also, because two forms were used to 
separate the data into Bay Area independent schools and other schools outside of that organization, further research 
can be conducted using only the data gathered from one specific survey. Another idea for further investigation is the 
redistribution of this survey after a certain period of time to determine whether or not the proportion of interest 
according to demographic categories has changed over time. Further statistical analysis could be run comparing the 
two times. 
 
If this project is performed again, more time would be allotted for data collection and analysis. The priority for data 
collection would be obtaining a more representative sample, especially since some categories in demographics, such 
as American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander in race had to be removed due to no 
responses in those groups. Also, some groups received little responses compared to other groups. One notable 
example is the category of Economically Distressed, which received only seventeen responses, compared to 
Economically Comfortable, which received 113 responses. More diversity could be achieved by reaching out to 
people in groups who originally did not have many, or any, responses. Additionally, the data for general and career 
interest in STEM as a whole was negatively skewed, and a larger and more representative sample could make the 
distribution less skewed.

Abstract 
Marketing strategies have been one of the top considerations in commercial companies due to the effect on business 
sales lead to the revenue. In order to build an effective marketing strategy, companies need understand of customer’s 
preferences and needs. With the digital marketing, many companies are able to have customers around the world. 
Managing and analyzing the customer data in large scale and transform it to useful information is necessary for 
supporting to business under uncertain environment. This study aims to provide a new two-phase framework for 
segmenting customers based on the RFM model. Phase 1 implements fuzzy C mean clustering algorithms to segment 
the customers. Phase 2 focuses on ranking customer segment using weighted interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy sets 
which allow to integrated opinions of groups decision makers even different knowledge and points of view when 
giving judgments. A numerical example in e-commerce is provided to illustrate the proposed method for solving 
practical problems. The results obtained from the model can be used to develop object-oriented marketing strategies 
or to develop customer relationship management campaigns.

1. Introduction 
Utilizing the Internet, more individuals can profit from online administrations, including e Commerce. With 
the support of technology applications, E-commerce has gradually become a daily shopping habit of consumers around 
the world. According to stastista.com, they predict about 22% of the world's retailers are online and online sales will 
reach $5 trillion by the end of 2021 (""Global retail e-commerce market size 2014-2023 | Statista"", 2021). The 
advantage of this form of business makes transactions much easier because of increasing accessibility of the Internet. 
In addition, online business allows collecting information of huge number of customers that useful for developing and 
executing marketing strategies.  
Customer segmentation is a preferable tool that help business orient strategies for different groups of 
customers. Based on the customer data, companies can extract the customer information depend on their marketing 
strategies. Customer data, identifying with distinct needs, characteristics or behaviors, are categorized into 
homogenous groups. The main purpose of segment is to understand the current customers and to reach potential 
customers. Companies can bring right products, right time, right price to right customers.  
With the huge number of customers, E-commerce, banking, hospitality have been applied to segment 
customer for different marketing strategies. Moreover, ranking the segments can be used for suggesting group target 
customers. In ranking process, opinions of group of decision makers directly influence to final ranking results. In 
recent years, although many the frameworks have been proposed to segment and rank segment customers, but most

These are transformed to crisp numbers by using two methods weighted averaging and geometric averaging. 
As can be seen in Table 7 and 8, the ranking result is 𝐴𝐴3 ≻𝐴𝐴2 ≻𝐴𝐴4 ≻𝐴𝐴1. Hence, the cluster 𝐴𝐴3 is the most potential 
customer group. The negative numbers (e.g. -0.023, see Table 7) show the level of uncertain of decision makers is 
higher that of certain and vice versa when they give their judgment.

6. Conclusion 
Segmenting customer and identifying target customers are a complex procedure because integrating opinions 
of group rather than that of individual. Inviting experts in various fields to give their judgements in the same object. 
However, experts may give no judgment or show degree of certain or uncertain in their judgments.  Additionally, the 
judgments of the key person are considered more impact than that of others. These factors are ignored in the existing 
studies.   
The study proposes the two-phased framework for segment and ranking segment customers based on RFM 
model by using the Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm and weighted interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy numbers.  
Highlights of this study are to allow to aggregate degree of certain and uncertain of decision makers when giving the 
judgemnts. The role of each expert is expressed under the weights. Higher weight shows the more important role.  
The final result shows that the framework is effective for segmenting and ranking group of customer with 
the same priority for R, F, M, various fields and different weights of experts. This method still works if these priorities 
of R, F, M are changed based on type of business or suggestions of experts.

Abstract 
 
Machining additively manufactured parts to improve surface finish is, sometimes, a challenging process because 
different manufacturing orientations and process parameters result in different machined surfaces. Extensive research 
has been devoted to additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and their abilities to produce end-use parts. However, 
post processing such as machining is still required for many applications. In this paper, non-traditional machining, 
Wire Electric Discharge Machining (WEDM), is used to study the result of WEDM on the surface roughness and 
machining time when the layer thickness and cutting orientation are changed. In this study, three layers’ thicknesses 
(LT = 60, 80, 100 μm) and three orientations of cut are considered; wire cuts in a perpendicular plane to a layer (Ori-
1), wire cuts in a parallel plane to a layer (Ori-2), and wire cuts all layers at the same time (Ori-3). Surface profilometry, 
scanning electron microscope (SEM), and machining time are used to evaluate the machining performance. The results 
show that the variation of the machining time for all layer thicknesses on Ori-1 and Ori-2 was minimal, except for 
Ori-3. Similarly, better surface quality could be achieved when the WEDM cuts along the Ori-2, whereas the variation 
of surface roughness (Sa) increases for the Ori-3. LT is also found to affect machining performance. For instance, 
when LT = 100 μm is employed, the roughness variation among different orientations increases up to 22.36%. On the 
other hand, roughness variation among different orientations reduced to 2.42% and 10.7% for LT of 60 μm and 80 
μm, respectively. Overall, it was found that the WEDM along the Ori-2 yields improved surface roughness for any 
layer thickness. Similarly, the SEM results also show that improved surface morphology with less redeposited material 
could be achieved when the parts are machined along the Ori-2 as compared to Ori-1 and Ori-3.

1. Introduction 
Since Titanium was produced commercially in 1948, there are more than 100 Titanium alloys have been developed, 
which are categorized according to the nominal compositions (Donachie 2000). The popularity of Titanium alloys is 
due to their excellent properties such as corrosion resistance and high-strength-to-weight ratio. One of the most 
common Titanium alloys is Ti6Al4V alloy which dominates more than fifty percent of the usage of Titanium, 
especially in aerospace industries (Leyens and Peters 2003), automotive industry (Veiga et al. 2012), and medical 
applications (Li et al. 2005), (Jorge et al. 2013) and (Wally et al. 2015). Due to the diverse industrial applications of 
Ti6Al4V, it has received significant attention from the developers and users of additive manufacturing (AM) 
technologies compare to all other metallic materials. For instance, the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) process is one 
of the AM technologies that fabricate parts by selectively melting consecutive layers of powder using a laser beam as 
a source of energy. The L-PBF technology can be used to manufacture complex shapes with satisfying mechanical 
properties (Frazier 2014) and (Gokuldoss et al. 2017). Sometimes, the built parts need post processing, such as heat 
treatment and machining, to tailor specific characteristics, remove unwanted phenomena (e.g. residual stress) or 
improve the surface roughness. Due to low thermal conductivity, low elasticity modulus and highly chemical 
reactiveness with cutting tool materials, titanium alloys are considered difficult-to-machine materials (Paulo Davim 
2014).

4. Conclusion 
Ti6Al4V powder bed fused samples were built with three different layer thicknesses and then machined using the 
WEDM process in three different orientations to studying the effect of the WEDM on surface roughness. The 
performance of the WEDM process on the L-PBF fabricated Ti6Al4V samples’ surfaces was accessed by using the 
3D scanned surface contours and scanning electron microscopy. Based on the results, the conclusions can be drawn 
as follows:

The machining speed seems to be influenced by layer thickness when WEDM is conducted along Ori-1. 
However, it appeared to be independent of the layer thickness on the other cutting orientations (i.e., Ori-2 and 
Ori-3). 
• 
The surface morphology images indicated that WEDM machining along the Ori-2 would lead to the best 
surface integrity for all the layer thicknesses.  
• 
Arithmetical mean height (Sa) values confirm the results obtained by SEM images; cutting in Ori-2 would lead 
to the minimum surface roughness. 
• 
Overall, it could be recommended to fabricate the Ti6Al4V parts with LT of 60 µm and the machining 
orientation Ori-2 must be preferred during the WEDM process.

Abstract 
 
The circular economy (CE) concept is a manufacturing method that represents regeneration, reparation, restoration by 
the plan. CE is emphasized as an upper-edge national political agenda in China. Meanwhile, it is an apparatus to 
develop bottom-up ecological, environmental and waste management policies in different regions as European Union, 
Japan and the USA. Bangladesh is a densely populated country that causes massive waste generation, which can be 
reused to reduce virgin raw material consumption, leading to economic and environmental amelioration. The review 
paper is based on factors such as CE perspective and sustainability, synergistic and integrative, CE- Digital technology 
(DT) framework, CE and industrial symbiosis network. This study fills in the blanks of various limitations and offers 
conceptual clarity with future work scope. It also analyzes the current CE and CE implementation practice in different 
industrial and agricultural sectors in Bangladesh. In addition, the study includes the CE in the ship demolition industry. 
It provides some key insights to implement CE, such as adopting suitable technologies, allowing budget & legislation, 
setting long term-plans and profitability & performance test. Finally, a suggestion towards implementing deep neural 
networking (DNN) in the shipbreaking industry was appeared to create a computational tool for estimating the amount 
of equipment obtained after a demolition project that can be less time-consuming, more efficient, and profitable.

1. Introduction 
The circular economy is the most trending concept of today's economy. Previously, this whole perspective of 
production was a linear economy. A linear economy operates on the principle of ""take-make-dispose."" This approaches 
entail processing raw materials, transforming them into finished products, and distributing them to customers until 
they are accumulated as waste. But, a CE is a process focused on reducing waste and continuous resource use. Here, 
the principle is to reuse, refurbished, and recycled the waste and generate a new form that can be utilized. After the 
production, this continuous process reuses the waste material to create something new. It does not need to be the same 
product. Industrial symbiosis can also lead the waste into another good. Recovered waste from one product can be 
used as a raw material of other production. Thus, the virgin raw material needs can decrease. That is why this circular 
production has a substantial economic value too. Without this raw material, the circular economy focuses on 
refurbishment and reuse after the end of life. Sometimes renovations are made. Otherwise, the product demolishes for 
further utilization. The worldwide attention is focused on circular production. The closer an industrial foundation gets 
to the circular economy paradigm, the more it reuses and cycles its waste. It becomes more efficient while creating 
fewer environmental risks. Circular economy primarily encourages the use of recycled materials and the adoption of 
environmentally friendly technology. It is intended to demonstrate how a circular economy can benefit society in an 
industrial setting (Nations Encyclopedia, 2021).  
 
The number of papers and journals on this subject has risen dramatically in the previous decade. The CE has also 
become an important topic of research in academics. Companies are now becoming more conscious of the possibilities 
offered by the CE and have begun to recognize the value it can provide to them and their clients (Geissdoerfer et al. 
2017). 
 
The concept of CE is widely used in the United States and several European countries. European countries are 
maintaining a circular economy at the highest rate following by America, Canada, and Africa also started focusing on

2375",,"while avoiding manual work. After analyzing numerous research papers and economic reports, the final thought is 
that proper education and training for employees, top-level management, will certainly help CE performance. The 
government should emphasize on industries to implement CE values for environmental issues. A CE-based program's 
effectiveness depends on the use of social technologies that increase community involvement, public education, and 
media attention. Bangladesh's ship recycling business has outstripped that of its neighboring nation in terms of income. 
The DNN model may forecast the revenue from an impending ship that needs to be dismantled. As a result, the user 
of this strategy may not have to bear the financial risk. In this approach, the suggested DNN model may contribute to 
the GDP growth of Bangladesh. Establishing a green ship recycling yard, a ship recycling economic zone, creating an 
industrial symbiosis network with local relevant industries, improving bilateral technology on ship breaking, adhering 
to the Hong Kong convention and detecting hazardous elements and properly disposing of them are some of the 
essential actions in the circular economy.

Abstract 
 
The industry of Korean pop, or K-Pop, has been focused on reaching the international market, and Indonesia is one of 
the sector's potential markets. Dissatisfaction with service encounters is still widespread in the industry, and some 
complaints are addressed through social media, particularly Twitter. Customer dissatisfaction involves particular 
emotion and can result in various behavioral responses, which can then influence the customer's repurchase intention. 
Negative emotion is the mediating variables between the dependent and independent variables. The effect of 
dissatisfaction on customer behavior and repurchase intention toward K-Pop products and organizations is explored 
in this study. This study is conducted on Indonesian K-Pop fans who have experienced and addressed dissatisfaction 
about its service. The data was collected through an online questionnaire. Research hypotheses was analyzed using 
PLS-SEM and mediating variable testing to determine the relationship between the dependent and independent 
variables. The outcomes of this study can benefit K-Pop companies’ marketers in developing their tactics of marketing 
and dissatisfaction handling for Indonesian market by assessing Indonesian customer’s behavior response and 
repurchase intention after dissatisfaction towards the products and organizations.

Abstract 
 
We study an inventory optimization problem for a retailer that faces stochastic online and in-store demand in a selling 
season of fixed length. The retailer has to decide the order-up-to inventory levels and an order fulfillment policy that 
optimizes the expected total costs. We propose a technique that combines the framework of Turing-Good sampling 
and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm obtains an average of 6.2% total cost reduction compared to a state-of-
the-art algorithm. The cost decrease is obtained by reserving more inventory, thereby reducing the lost sales costs and 
reducing fulfillment costs. The algorithm we propose is especially beneficial for shorter time horizons and higher in-
store demand.

1. Introduction  
In recent years, the number of retailers that opt for an omnichannel strategy, where customers can buy products in 
brick and mortar stores and online, has increased considerably. The brick-and-mortar stores appeal to customers who 
prefer to experience the product and purchase it immediately.  On the other hand, the online channel appeals to 
customers who prefer to see a greater variety of products from their homes' comfort and are willing to wait for the 
product to be delivered. We will use the term omnichannel retailer for a retailer that sells her products both via the 
online channel and the store. 
 
Integrating the two channels comes with many complexities (Hübner et al., 2016). For example, one of the major 
issues faced by omnichannel retailers is integrating the inventories of the brick and mortar stores with the inventory 
and fulfillment decisions of the online orders. 
 
This paper will study a joint fulfillment and inventory optimization problem for an omnichannel retailer with N stores. 
We consider one product over a selling horizon of T time periods. In-store demand is fulfilled from the inventory at 
the specific store if available, while online orders can be fulfilled from any of the stores at the end of each time period.  
Orders that are not fulfilled are lost, and a penalty is incurred. The goal is to decide the initial inventory such that the 
expected total costs (that is, holding, transportation, and penalty costs) are minimized.  
 
To solve this problem, we propose a new heuristic based on a  two-stage stochastic optimization formulation. In the 
first stage, we decide the initial inventory, and in the second stage, we solve the fulfillment allocation. The two-stage 
optimization problem is solved on a selected set of scenarios. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm by 
Govindarajan et al. (2020), our algorithm indicates an average improvement in the expected total cost of 6.2%, with a 
maximum gain of 28.6%.

2387","average cost decrease is 55% for T = 3 and 35% for T = 7, while for the online penalties, the average reduction is 97% 
for T=3 and 84.3 % for T = 7. The average increase in inventory costs is 26.7% for T = 3 and 9.8% for T = 7.  
 
By comparing Tables 1-3, we see that the highest cost reductions are for p = 0.5, which means that the higher the 
proportion of in-store demand, the better our algorithm performs in comparison with GSU2020. Moreover, the 
algorithm performs better for short horizons, T = 3.  
 
Table 4 explores our algorithm's performance for lower online penalties (𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑜= 50) and equal proportions of online 
and offline demand. Our algorithm obtains an average total cost decrease of 8.2%. The reduction is due to lower 
penalties and fulfillment costs than GSU2020, despite increasing holding costs by up to 28.7%.

However, the cost reduction is less obvious for cases with T = 7 (on average 1.1% across all cases). Here, the 
percentage decrease in penalties and fulfillment costs is much smaller than for the cases with T = 3, and so is the 
increase in holding costs. Our justification is that longer time horizons have similar inventory requirements for both 
approaches. Nevertheless, the average cost reductions for both T = 3 and T = 7 show that our approach still outperforms 
GSU2020 at smaller penalty values. 
 
6. Conclusions  
This paper proposed a new technique to optimize initial inventory for an omnichannel retailer facing stochastic 
demand in a selling season of fixed length. We used the Turing-Good estimator to sample demand scenarios, which 
are then clustered based on a similarity measure. 
 
We approximate the optimal solution by solving a two-stage stochastic optimization problem on a reduced set of 
scenarios via the L-shaped method. Compared to (Govindarajan et al. 2020), our experiments obtain an average total 
cost reduction of 6.2%, with a maximum of 28.6%. In general, this cost decrease is due to higher levels of the on-hand 
inventory and lower lost sales costs. Higher inventories at stores also result in lower fulfillment costs, as they facilitate 
transportation from closer locations. Our algorithm outperforms (Govindarajan et al. 2020), especially for shorter time 
periods and a relatively high proportion of in-store demand. For a longer time horizon and high demand rates, we

amount of inventory when demand is highly variable, indicating a need for better algorithms for these cases. 
 
In this paper, we have assumed that the retailer has an established fulfillment network and have ignored the impact of 
returns. Further cost reductions could be obtained if decisions regarding network design are incorporated into the 
model.

Abstract  
Circular economy approach means to increase the reuse of once acquired natural material in economy. Both 
environmental protection supporting initiatives and increasing awareness of pollution problematic is helping to 
increase recycled waste ratios. Main consumers in economy are Households and as result also main actor in generating 
waste. Literature analysis identifies the household role Sort a Source (SAS) as applicable approach, while limited 
information on recognized process components for household sorted waste habits with environmental impact 
assessment.  
Challenges for efficient waste management:   
1. Different implementations require different levels of household involvement in sorting processes for various 
sorted waste types.  
2. Waste management is closely linked to infrastructure and introducing changes are both costly and lengthy, 
thus defining efficient processes is one of key long term aspects.  
3. Various products sold have different lifecycle for their components (ex. Packaging vs actual product, more 
complex in case of replaceable parts), including recyclability, thus analysis of value chain has to be split to 
component lifecycle analysis (LCA) and recycling possibilities.  
Keywords  
Circular economy, Value chain activities, Waste management, Household and Sort-At-Source (SAS). 
 
1. Introduction 
A waste sorting and further recycling is basis for Circular economy. Society also is getting more aware of long term 
beneficial impacts of waste sorting and sorted waste ratios are increasing. Consumption of different products can be 
grouped by three main groups with different characteristics: industrial, commercial and household. Each of identified 
groups have different work processes and different waste management value chains with specifics attributes. In this 
article authors are focusing on household sorted waste analysis to identify factors, what are influencing waste sorting 
efficiency and identifying some challenges for efficiency analysis.  
Households are critical as sorting at a source is one of most efficient approach to reduce total costs in waste recycling 
value chain, still there are some common aspects, what was not identified, and analysed in reviewed literature for full 
lifecycle costing. Analysis traditionally focuses either on Operator as waste or recycling system manager, also 
representing governance and normative regulation, while analysing household behaviour focuses on behavioural 
aspects. In this article authors assesses household role in product lifecycle focusing on waste management aspect and 
identifies elements, what are directly connected, with waste sorting with environmental impact, and what are external 
cost for operator service. Sorted waste processed are directly linked with implemented into particular area solution 
and defined requirements by waste operator. More convenient sorted waste processes *(value chains) would increase 
higher sorting rates with reduced rejected sorted waste ratios. 
Secondary problem: In literature, the generalized model is referenced as analysis scope, giving result with granularity 
which is to low, to derive detailed conclusions for analysis for household level and directly use as input in CAD 
models for calculations. 
Discussion items:   
• Value chain elements identified in waste management process for Household 
• Granularity of data necessary for detailed analysis - Household effort and materials consumed as part of 
process (granularity). 
Separate topic for further analysis – Regulative/normative requirement changes to support sorted waste management 
process, but not recognizing Households as unpaid primary resources for Recycling operators.

parameters could be identified of grouped while maintaining principle to minimize total costs of ownership for 
households (not operator primarily LCCA analysis). 
 
3.4 Discussion items and analysis challenges 
Discussion items open – In depth assessment model methodology for complex multiple stage manufacturing, 
representing logistic (component delivery for assembling sites) and infrastructure, with environmental cost 
contribution methodology. Methodology and models present and analyse environmental impact as in each stage there 
are limited information available for full lifecycle and thus proceed assigning estimated effect to particular activity 
indicating potential for recycling (Manufacturing and distribution phase). Also due the different infrastructure support 
implemented (Instantiation) in different areas, actual efficiency is closely related with options for waste sorting (Waste 
management Operator and Recyclers). On area /region or even national level further to proceed review and inclusion 
in relevant metrics for reporting (Area/National level).  
Challenge in analysis – approach definition, waste as process or waste as output leading to different models: 
Sample composed waste accounting in waste processing have to be analysed separately as household identification 
there needs to split further, to rural and several urban by accessible infrastructure options). These aspects are aligning 
in Figure 1. presented concept that most efficient is to reduce unneeded consumption, what would be applied with 
reducing some components, what are hard to recycle with components what have better recyclability. 
 
3.5 Proposed Improvements  
Main improvements for further analysis and implementation can be identified:  
1. For future assessment of waste recycling, recognize all components in product or service lifecycle together 
with available sorted waste infrastructure in area (also environmental costs in producing and logistics before 
consumption);  
2. Recognize household effort and resources used in waste sorting as process “cost” with environmental impact 
(also as one of process parameters for implementation: a minimizing costs and effort in a household in 
recyclable waste process service infrastructure planning); 
3. Consider to introduce recyclability index also in complex items *(product with packaging at a sales point), 
what is directly related with product /component recyclability and accumulated environmental impact 
(Sample of non-conformance food packaging (Indicating Recyclable plastics) requiring washing before it 
can be recognized as recyclable waste) – This improvement requires further research due complexity in 
practical implementation. 
 
4. Conclusions  
1. 
Literature analysis confirms and is providing insights for waste management as a value chain, indicating 
sorted waste as definite process 
a. 
Carry-over (*forward) principle is critical of full evaluation of the environmental impact for total 
product waste assessment as basis for total LCA of product or service environmental impact rating as 
TCO (Total Cost of Ownership);  
b. Develop and with relevant methodology included in normative based and implement a product a rating 
-   Waste recyclability index, representing of total effort needed for recycling, note, for products, not 
rated - define Default value as baseline for evaluation as a baseline;  
c. 
Further developments and coordination on policies would be needed to consider as Household actually 
is last stage of direct product use lifecycle and in case used materials in whole value chain are not 
recyclable, thus limit whole process efficiency for recycling; 
d. Potentially assessing with indexes at a Point of sale a consumer goods, indicating summary estimated 
environmental impact for full lifecycle (consider ref. to equipment energy rating scale); 
e. 
Potentially introducing recyclability indexes can be linked to increasing of planned usable life for 
products as savings of environmental impact would offset additional costs on manufacturing or 
distribution value chain elements; 
f. 
Index also could be used to increase awareness /contribute for environmental aspects;  
2. 
Confirmed and elaborated the identification of sorted waste as particular input of product/service value 
chain activity according circular economy concept. 
3. 
Analysis result a simplified model and an activity model for household waste sorting was developed and 
discussed.

2405","4. 
There were several gaps and improvements identified:  
a. 
Reflect all resources and value chain activities in waste sorting (Product lifecycle analysis and consider 
resources utilized upon sorting waste); 
b. Consider to minimize both effort and costs for household when planning waste management service 
implementation; 
c. 
There could be considered incentives to motivate household with bonuses with sorted waste what also 
would help to increase awareness and participation to increase overall recycling on SAS does require 
effort and cost at household. 
5. 
General consideration - important aspect to support whole process is indicated a – relevant Infrastructure is 
one of key elements  
to increase recycling levels but for actual recycling level all related 
environmental cost elements would have to be reflected and included.

Abstract  
 
 A popular form of participatory active training methods in the education of professionals and executives are 
simulations and game-based teaching methods. These approaches are ideal to teach Lean Management, focusing on 
knowledge transfer rather than studying plane theory. The application of Lean Management is much focused on 
practice, but not memory. Still a critical assessment of existing simulation and game-based Lean Training methods in 
this field has been lacking. Limited information is available on simulation and game-based Lean training of executive 
and professionals. Thus, a web-based search was conducted using a set of key words and logical relations among them 
and constraints on them. A total of 49 different simulations and games were identified and classified according to their 
emphasis on standalone lean tools or the overall lean philosophy, the area of application, the manifestation, number 
of iterations and the consideration of soft-skills. The majority lacks a stress on soft-skills and concentrate on single 
tools to be used in production. The number of findings concentrating on an application in offices resp. administration 
is dwindling. Only few are designed for online usage and most are fairly abstract, which requires the participants to 
be familiar with abstraction and the aspects of Lean tools. Authentic and realistic simulators and games are missing 
in professional and executive education. Future directions for the improvement of lean simulation design are 
proposed.

1. Introduction  
Although Lean Management is becoming more and more popular with industrial organizations, its prevalence in 
academic education is rather modest. Less than one third of German higher education institutions included it to their 
syllabus (Pötters, Szedlak, & Leyendecker, 2019). Thus, the range of continuous education and profession trainings 
play a crucial role in transferring knowledge to the industry. Various consultancy companies and centres of continuous 
education offer Lean training courses. However, to successfully implement Lean Management transferred knowledge 
is crucial. The Ballés (2005) argue that in this context, studying plain theory is insufficient. Rather trainees must 
understand how the theory applies to industrial situations. Therefore, the application of Lean Management is much 
focused on practice, but not memory.  
 
Based on the learning pyramid (Figure 1), developed by the United States National Training Laboratories, the learners 
recall associated with passive learning methods (lecture, reading, audio visual and demonstrations) is quite low. 
Although the learning pyramid lacks empirical evidence according to Letrud (2012) and empirical test would cause 
major methodological problems, it represents the amount of theory people remember for each teaching methods. Thus, 
participatory teaching methods, involving trainees in group discussions as well as practice oriented simulations and 
games, are the preferred methods in Lean training. Still the learning outcome is not equal to the faculty of memory 
(Yonglianga, Hua, Jiaob, Mingqianga, & Guanghuia, 2015). In addition, the application of tools and of the Lean 
Philosophy must be trained. Most vendors in executive and professional education choose simulation and game-based 
training methods as a form of participatory active teaching methods. This article provides a critical assessment of 
existing simulation and game-based lean trainings.

2408","that the correlation between actions and results become visible (Johannson, 2012). Still the task must present a 
challenging problem, to encourage participants to participate in the problem solving (Dukovska-Popovska, Hove-
Madsen, & Nielsen, 2008). This means a learning through experience must be possible. This requires few boundaries 
presenting a simplified but still realistic environment with real problems. The problem solving must be rather open 
than in a linear way. Therefore, that learning can take place at an application level. However, most existing 
simulations and games concentrate on awareness training only. In particular, experienced workers ask for a level of 
abstraction of the learning environment that allows for experimental learning. Recent literature argues that learning 
takes place best if the trainee moves back and fourth between his comfort zone and the challenge zone. The latter 
steps up the degree of difficulty presenting participants with a challenging problem to be solved. This is where 
learning outcome at an application level is generated, enabling the trainee to understand how trouble shooting using 
the tools at hand works and can be applied under various conditions. The desired skills and insights are consolidated 
in the so-called comfort zone. Therefore, it is important in professional and executive training to provide a realistic 
environment that is familiar to the trainee, to teach them to learn from failures. Lean philosophy does not mean to 
tolerate failures but also means to realize that “you have to fail to progress” (Osono, Shimizu, & Takeuchi, 2008). 
This insights can’t be generated at an awareness level.   
 
The current situation has also caused many providers of training courses to rethink their existing approach. So far, 
there are hardly any digital versions of lean simulations and games. However, many start to concentrate on hybrid 
versions. Still a lack of variants that enable decentralized participation not missing on the moderation of an 
experienced facilitator must be noted. The incorporation of the topics discussed above are particularly difficult. In 
particular, the opportunity to develop personal and soft skills must be given in a virtual environment as well. The 
mapping and reflection of different roles in spatially distributed teams also represents a challenge that has not yet 
been addressed. What must not happen under any circumstances is that the participants are left to their own devices. 
Even if learning with the help of tutorials and video recordings promises a lot of flexibility, sustainable lean training 
requires an experienced facilitator who guides the discussions and reflection on tools, roles and skills and promotes 
the self-learning process through targeted input to the discussion rounds. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The main conclusion of the evaluation summarizes as follows: 
- 
The analysis of 49 simulations and games from vendors of professional and executive training showed that 
the majority has a production line focus. Lean administration is usually neglected or it is recommended to 
book the same simulation or games, since the learning outcome can be transferred. Therefore participants are 
usually confronted with a high degree of abstraction or an unfamiliar situation that makes it hard to see behind 
the concept, e.g. focusing on physiomotric skills instead. Thus, more realistic simulations of office 
environments to teach lean administration are needed.  
- 
The majority of games and simulation focus on an awareness training. This means participants are trained to 
apply the theory and discussed tools in an unique and simplified situation, learning how to apply lean tool in 
a single set of conditions. We argue that simulations and games should present real life problems, which also 
includes stress or uncertainty. Learning must happen at an application level, enabling participants to put their 
know how to practice under various conditions. Also more attention must be paid to teaching soft skills and 
the understanding of different roles. 
- 
Almost all existing simulations and games concentrate on a single pass approach demonstrating the 
transformation of a current to a desired state. The design is set up to reach the ideal situation within a single 
run. This conveys the wrong image and raises unrealistic expectations. We argue that simulations must be a 
preview of the real world to experience incremental change in lean transformations, also allowing participants 
to discuss and reflect on the humans role and behavior during the problem solving.  
- 
Digital or virtual versions are not existing. Spatially distributed teams pose a particular challenge, both in 
terms of application and as an object of simulation. Not to be neglected is the role of the moderator, who, as 
an experienced lean expert, has to slip into the role of thefacilitator. 
 
However, results only included games and simulations that provided detailed information to be analysed. Many 
vendors offer different variants or versions of the reviewed games and simulations, that might address learning 
outcomes differently. In particular, information on digital versions was only sporadic.

Abstract 
 
Invasive species devastate entire ecosystems, and Senecio Elegans is not a very well-known invasive in the state of 
California. Therefore, the goal of this project was to understand Senecio Elegans plant dispersion and population size 
in order to inform volunteer efforts to remove the weed. The method of stratified random sampling of two beaches at 
Half Moon Bay State Beach was used to find the population size and dispersion of Senecio Elegans and a non-invasive 
species similar to it (Cakile Maritima). Random samples were taken on two beaches: the first beach had 20 samples 
and the second had 15 samples. Statistical testing of the results yielded a clumped dispersion pattern for both beaches 
and both plants. Beach 1 (Dunes Beach) had an estimated population size of 55 Senecio Elegans and Beach 2 
(Roosevelt Beach) had an estimated population size of 240 Senecio Elegans. Beach 1 (Dunes Beach) had an estimated 
population size of 185 Cakile Maritima and Beach 2 (Roosevelt Beach) had an estimated population size of 6 Cakile 
Maritima. Comparing the population sizes on both beaches yielded a statistically insignificant result.

Abstract 
 
Websites have different purposes. Some of which intend legitimate functions in the economy while some 
of which intend harmful cases towards users. Although various research has been made to address this 
problem, these detection systems still leave plenty of room for improvement, specifically on its 
performances. This study was based on the recommended approach for future work by a related work 
wherein it contains 10 base features of a URL for its classification. The recommended approach states that 
an extended number of features from the base features increases the detection accuracy. In this paper, it 
proposes a comparison between the performance of three cases: the base 10 features, an extended feature 
set, and a set where a feature selection algorithm is applied. The researchers utilized machine learning 
algorithms to build models in classifying legitimate and malicious URLs. The study showed that there is a 
directly proportional relationship with a model’s number of features and a model’s performance. Extending 
the number of features of the data set leads to an increase with the performance of each model.

URL Classification, machine learning, feature selection algorithm 
 
1. Introduction 
The advent of the internet has transformed the world into a global village, thus revolutionizing the communication 
technologies that have impacted the lives of people as well as the growth of businesses (Shivangi et al. 2018). 
Malicious URLs are an important security issue to the Internet, which has a significant economic impact. By now, it 
is still a challenging problem (Chunlin et al. 2018). Machine learning techniques have been increasingly applied to 
solve the problems relating to information security and cybersecurity. Malicious URL (Uniform Resource Locator) 
detection is one of these (Vanhoenshoven et al. 2016).   
This paper aims to compare three approaches on URL classification. These approaches will differ on the 
features used in model creation. The first approach contains a set of 10 features adapted from Cuzzocrea et al. (2018). 
The second approach extends the feature set of the first approach. The last approach implements a feature selection 
algorithm on the features of the second approach to contain the top number of features. J48, k-Nearest Neighbors, 
Sequential Optimal Optimization, and Random Forest are the classifiers to be used on the models. 
The following classifiers were selected because they yielded acceptable performance based on previous 
studies. Random Forest was used in the work of Cuzzocrea et al. (2018), Chunlin et al.(2018), Vanhoenshoven et al. 
(2016), Al-Janabi et al. (2017), and Yerima and Alzaylee (2020). For K-Nearest Neighbor, the related works 
Vanhoenshoven et al. (2016) and Al-Janabi et al. (2017). For J48, the works of Cuzzocrea et al. (2018), Chunlin et al. 
(2018), Aydin et al. (2020), and Yerima and Alzaylee (2020). And for Support Vector Machines the works of Chunlin 
et al. (2018), Aung and Yamana (2019), and Vanhoenshoven et al. (2016) wherein the researchers used C-Support 
Vector Classification. The different machine learning algorithms were used to determine the algorithm that has the 
best performance. The previous studies had different results for each algorithm.

2421","get the most cost-efficient model. For this reason, it would assist in a possible future development of URL detection 
in a more efficient way wherein it would also work on weak and slow computers/mobile devices. Moreover, adding 
more features from the features this study has would be suggested. The researchers also recommend exploring different 
feature selection algorithms as it may yield different importance values to the respective features. 
 
5.4 Validation 
A stratified 10-fold cross-validation was used. This is performed to assess the effectiveness of the model reducing the 
chances of overfitting. It works well with an imbalanced dataset because the dataset is partitioned into k groups such 
that the validation data has an equal number of instances of the target class. 
 
6. Conclusion 
By the end of the study, the researchers were able to apply the recommended approach from Cuzzocrea et al. (2018) 
for malicious URL detection using machine learning techniques. Features were added from the related works of Aung 
and Yamana (2019), Al-Janabi et al. (2017), and Chapla et al. (2019). Feature selection algorithm method was applied 
to determine which are the relevant features in obtaining the performance of the model. 
As recommended by Cuzzocrea et al. (2018), extending the features influenced the performance of the model. 
In the study, each of the models had an increase in performance. This is because with several features included, it 
considers numerous combinations of those features to yield the optimal classifier for the model (Chatterjee and Namin 
2019). Feature selection method was used on the extended features using Gain Ratio Algorithm. In the study, each of 
the models had a decrease in performance but also a significant increase in performance as compared to the base 
features. The average best performance in the variations of selecting the top number of features in the Gain Ratio 
algorithm is the top 75% of the features. However, the Extended Feature Set still had a better performance than the 
Feature Selection Set. Overall, the machine learning algorithm that produced the best model in malicious URL 
detection is Random Forest in the Extended Features Set which achieved an accuracy, precision, and recall of 
99.552%, 99.553%, and 99.552%, respectively. Compared to the result of the work of Cuzzocrea et al. (2018), their 
model using J48 yielded 92.3% in precision and 91.6% in recall. As for the related work with regards to Gain Ratio 
feature selection algorithm in the study of Aydin et al. (2020), with the best accuracy of 97.18% using J48. From 
these, this study resulted in better performance in accuracy, precision, and recall.

Abstract 
 
Energy overuse in transportation is recently generating harmful effects to the environment. Green logistics is becoming 
a prospective trend in the growing logistics industry. This paper investigates the green vehicle routing problem (Green-
VRP), with two objectives: minimizing combined fuel emissions and minimizing distance traveled with capacitated 
vehicles. An improved K-means clustering method is employed to group demand nodes to reduce the size of the 
problem. The model is then verified using a set of customers in Ho Chi Minh city, computational results show 3 
clusters of customers. In addition, a real application for mobile phones namely “Control Fleet Vehicle” is created to 
help users control their fleets of vehicles and connect easily to customers.

1. Introduction 
Transportation really plays a particularly vital role in logistics and this role will increase because the cost of transport 
accounts for an increasing proportion of logistics. Therefore, the logistics organizations try to bring higher production 
efficiency and competitiveness of logistics by reducing transportation costs. However, quick development of 
transportation sector also comes along negative impacts on society, health, and environment which are the 
consequences of increases in the abundance of hazardous emissions. Due to the rapid development of e-commerce, 
which leads to the presence of the transport occur more and more, the transportation industry has been one of the main 
sources of increased energy consumption and carbon emission in recent years. This urges the governments and 
scholars to deploy a new green-logistic supply chain system, reducing fuel emissions in transportation service. 
 
Inspired by the traditional Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which was first formulated mathematically by (Dantzig 
& Ramser, 1959) thereby studied by numerous researchers throughout the field of transportation, this study extends 
the problem to Green Vehicle Routing Problem (G – VRP), aiming at contributing the recent environmental awareness 
in the field of transportation in logistic by combining fuel consumption and travelled distance optimization. More 
specifically, the G-VRP is applied within the scope of transportation service case in Ho Chi Minh city – one of the 
biggest cities in Vietnam. The is now producing huge wellspring of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG, accounting for 
about 16% of national emissions, in which GHG from the transport sector accounts for 45% ((MONRE) & DCC, 
2015). 
 
Objectives: 
The purpose of the study is to minimize the total distance travelled and the total fuel consumption by vehicles to 
increase not only customer satisfaction but also sustainable development of company’s transportation service. The 
fuel utilization minimization is the significant goal along with the distance minimization. Therefore, appropriate 
weights are given to each of the sub-objective. The solution is a set of routes by that each customer will be served 
only once and concerning vehicle capacity constraints.

7. Conclusion 
In conclusion, sustainable transportation and green logistics have been a widespread topic in the field, attracting 
continuous attempts of both industry and academia, to find better approaches to go towards environmentally friendly 
economy. This paper contributes a solution method for the Green Vehicle Routing Problem, compromising vehicle 
travelled distance and fuel emissions optimization.  The computational experiment on a case of Ho Chi Minh city 
customer set shows that the above objective is achievable given acceptable computing time, bringing motives for 
future investment. This study also provides an application for supporting transportation companies implement 
reducing CO2 emission, saving cost and keep tracking fleets of vehicles.

Abstract 
 
This research is focused on the development and comparison of models based on ensemble machine learning 
algorithms to predict professional career development preferences among students five years after their graduation 
using the results of the University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students’ Survey 2018. The research is carried out following 
a classic 4-stage methodology (analysis, design, development, and validation). During the analysis, surveys are 
thoroughly reviewed and preprocessed. During the design, questions are grouped and combined to build 11 predictive 
models. Construction and validation are carried out entirely using the software WEKA. For the purposes of this 
investigation 1.121 surveys are considered. Initially the dataset is split up in a subset for training and test (80%) and 
a subset for validation (20%). The approach to predict students’ mid-term career preferences comprised the use of an 
ensemble scheme (stacking) composed by a logistic regression as meta-model, and a decision tree, and a support 
vector machine as base models. Experimental results show that half the proposed models predict correctly around 77% 
of the surveys. In conclusion, ensemble models can be used to predict students’ professional career development 
preferences. However, predictions’ accuracy depends on the attribute selection.

1. Introduction 
After college, newly graduated professionals face many challenges in the job market. An important decision to be 
made is whether to apply for a job in a company or to start their own business. The factors involved in this decision 
have been discussed by several authors. Some based their argumentation on the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 
1991), others on the theory of the human motivation (McClelland, 1987).  
 
There are multiple factors that can explain the entrepreneurial attitude. Usually, they are classified in two categories. 
On the one hand are the personal characteristics such as risk aversion, autonomy, goal-orientation, power, and 
management knowledge. On the other hand, factors related to social environment such as family’s entrepreneurial 
background, economy, formal education and training, and social networks (Sieger, 2011; Zellweger et al., 2011; 
Bagheri et al., 2015; Gorgievski et al., 2018; Israr and Saleem, 2018; Bosma et al., 2021).  
 
During their university years, students acquired knowledge and develop specific skills that are required to perform 
properly during their future professional. These skills can be classified as cognitive, socio-emotional, and technical 
(Prada and Rucci, 2016). Students can also develop entrepreneurial ecosystems whose success depends on the 
connectedness and effective filtration, and on having a strong local and interregional character (Prokop, 2021). Besides 
that, the orientation of the university education plays an important role too (Franke and Lüthje, 2004). 
 
The Global University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students' Survey (GUESSS) is a global study conducted every 2-3 years 
at universities in more than 50 countries by University of Saint Gallen (Switzerland). Its main objective is to determine 
the factors that drive students’ entrepreneurial intentions and activities by means applying a model proposed by Sieger, 
et al. (2011), which states that the entrepreneurial intention depends on the behavioral attitude, subjective norms, and

6. Conclusion 
The answers to GUESSS 2018 survey provide valuable information about students’ career development preferences 
that can be used adapt lectures and contents to help students develop the skills needed either to start their business or 
to facilitate their access and adaptation to companies. When working with machine learning schemes, either single or 
ensemble algorithms, it is preferable to apply a cross-validation (k=10) scheme to get rid of the influence of 
partitioning randomness instead of simply holding out a portion of data. Averaging ten (k=10) results will be always 
better than having only one number. Furthermore, running replications help reduce the bias caused by the fold 
partitioning. Having a validation dataset is an important part of the investigation, it helps determine whether the models 
can generalize properly or not. The results show that half of the models proposed in the research (M0, M1, M3, M4, 
and M9) can predict correctly around 77% of the surveys in the training and test dataset, and in the validation dataset 
too. Even though, prediction ratios are similar there are significant differences in the number of attributes of each 
model. Finally, prediction ratios and confusion matrices suggest that the proposed classification models based on 
ensemble schemes do help predict mid-term professional career development preferences among university students 
using objective criteria based on multiple attributes.

Abstract 
 
The millennial generation is a great asset and principal human capital for national development with 
superior potential in marketing era 4.0 compared to the previous generation. Marketing has developed 
rapidly from product to customer oriented. Marketing era 4.0 combines human touch with consumers 
through technological advancement, which tends to concern the use of technology, taste in music, and 
lifestyle. Today, young generations quickly access information via smartphone and create a consumptive 
lifestyle through social media. In conjunction with the issue, this study is written to investigate the 
moderating role of social media in the relationship of reinventing potential and financial independence 
toward entrepreneurs' character in marketing era 4.0. This quantitative study involved as many as 448 
students, which spread four departments from Faculty Economics and Business, Universitas Malikussaleh, 
Lhokseumawe, Indonesia. The data analysed using descriptive statistics and Structural Equation Modelling 
– Analysis of Moments Structure (SEM - AMOS) for inferential statistics analysis. The result showed that 
reinventing potential and financial independence significantly affects the entrepreneurial character of the 
millennial generation in the marketing era - 4.0. Also, this study found that social media moderates the 
relationship between the millennial generation's financial independence and entrepreneurial character. 
However, social media does not moderate the relationship between reinventing potential and the 
entrepreneurial character of the millennial generation in the marketing era 4.0. In conclusion, this study has 
found that the role of social media in marketing era 4.0. Also, social media becomes a necessity for 
millennials in their day-long activities by using Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and others that have 
inspired them to apply creative and innovative ideas. In addition, social media has a big influence on the 
desire of the millennial generation to carry out entrepreneurial activities.

2462","4.3. Social Media and Entrepreneurs character 
The influence of social media on the entrepreneurial character is 0.33 with a probability value of 0.000 which is much 
smaller than 0.05, meaning that social media has a positive and significant effect on the entrepreneurial character of 
the millennial generation. Social media has become a necessity for millennials in their day-long activities. The 
presence of social media such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and others has inspired them to apply creative and 
innovative ideas. Social media has a big influence on the desire of the millennial generation to carry out entrepreneurial 
activities 
 
4.4. Social Media as Moderating Variable 
The low social media intensity coefficient, the effect of reinventing potential on entrepreneurial character, is 0.57 with 
a probability value of 0.000, much smaller than 0.05, which means that the potential for reinventing has a significant 
effect on the character of millennial entrepreneurship at the 1% significance level. The high social media intensity 
coefficient value has the effect of reinventing potential on the entrepreneurial character of 0.40 with a probability 
value of 0,000 which is much smaller than 0.05, meaning that reinventing potential has a significant effect on the 
entrepreneurial character of the millennials at 1% significance level. Because the two probability values are significant 
both at low social media intensity and high social media intensity, it can be concluded that social media does not 
moderate (does not strengthen) the effect of potential reinventing on the entrepreneurial character of the millennial 
generation in Indonesia. 
 
The coefficient value of low social media intensity, the effect of financial independence on entrepreneurial character, 
is 0.17 with a probability value of 0,000 which is much smaller than 0.05, meaning that financial independence has a 
significant effect on the entrepreneurial character of the millennial generation in Indonesia at the 1% level of 
significance. The coefficient value of high social media intensity, the effect of financial independence on 
entrepreneurial character, is 0.04 with a probability value of 0.60, which is much greater than 0.05, meaning that 
financial freedom has no significant effect on the entrepreneurial character of the millennial generation in Indonesia. 
Because there is a significant difference between the value of low social media intensity (significant) and high social 
media intensity (not significant), it can be concluded that social media moderates (strengthens) the effect of financial 
independence on the entrepreneurial character of the millennial generation in Indonesia. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, to foster entrepreneurial character among the millennial generation, it can be pursued through 
reinventing the potential of the millennial generation. The desire for financial freedom also encourages the growth of 
entrepreneurial interest in the millennial generation. In addition, social media is an important factor that can strengthen 
the growth of the entrepreneurial character of the millennial generation. Given that reinventing potential activities, the 
desire for financial freedom, and social media are important factors in shaping entrepreneurial character, stakeholders: 
government, business groups, and universities must be able to adjust programs, policies, and curriculum that can 
support the growth of entrepreneurial character among the millennial generation.

Abstract 
 
Natural resources such as forests, land and water are primary assets that should be maintained on the basis of the 
principle of sustainability and national benefits. Any development concerning natural resource management must be 
planned properly and directed in a watershed unit (DAS). Watersheds have different characteristics from one and 
another. It consists of size (area), elevation and slope (slope), aspect and orientation, the shape of the watershed and 
drainage network. Currently, stakeholders are not well handled by stakeholders, which is still technically (sectoral) 
and centralized. In line with the issue, it’s important to study integrated watershed management to improve the 
community welfare in Aceh province, Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to identify the watershed management 
actions, including maintained and restored. This study is designed using cross-sectional data with a survey method 
which consists of four stages, i.e., preparation, preliminary survey, main survey, data analysis and result presentation. 
The data analysis carried out by utilizing the Classification of Watershed (e.g., criteria, sub-criteria and weighting). 
This study indicated that six sub-watersheds in the Krueng Peusangan must be restored, namely Krueng Celala, 
Krueng Meuh, Krueng Peusangan Hilir, Timang Gajah and With Balek due to watersheds are damaged, during drought 
and monsoon.  In conclusion, this study has identified six sub-watersheds that needs to be restored across Krueng 
Peusangan, Aceh, Indonesia. Of these, some efforts must be made by the stakeholders, namely conserving soil on 
agricultural land, harvesting/ storing excess water during monsoon and utilizing it in drought. Also, promoting 
sustainable farming and stabilizing crop yields through improved agricultural systems management and improving 
ecological balance, including the relationship between upstream water management and downstream, water quality, 
land quality and capability and biodiversity.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays, the population growth and high stream of urbanization in the cities led to various issues, including road 
traffic accidents rate. Cities have attracted many researchers’ attention not only dynamism of its change that so fast, 
but world population movement from rural to urban areas or cities, such as Surabaya. The accident rate in Surabaya 
city keeps increasing and becomes more complex as a society still tends to use private vehicles. This situation has led 
to serious impacts, i.e. uncontrolled accidents. Surabaya Intelligent Traffic Systems (SITS) is one of the e-government 
implementations aiming to improve city safety and reduce accident rates in Surabaya. This study aims to analyse the 
role of collaborative e-government in SITS program. The design of this study is a qualitative approach through a semi-
systematic review approach. The data were collected from relevant previous studies, such as books, journals, and 
reports that focus on collaborative e-government in Surabaya Intelligent Transportation System. The result showed 
weaknesses in the coordination among the stakeholders and no legal rule to regulate SITS application. Therefore, 
Surabaya Government needs to enhance cooperation among relevant stakeholders to optimize collaborative e-
government and establish a legal law to rule SITS. In conclusion, this study has successfully identified and analysed 
the role of collaborative e-government in the Surabaya Intelligent Traffic Systems program. Therefore, collaborative 
e-government needs four principles, including value, technology, economic, and citizen drove.

1. Introduction 
Cities have become entities that attract many researchers’ attention due to the dynamism of its change so fast, but 
almost 50 percent of the world population will move to the city (Ansell and Gash 2008). This problem also happened 
in Surabaya, i.e. increasing population and high stream urbanization leads to various problems such as seen in the 
level of road traffic accidents. In Singapore, surveillance activities have dramatically increased, especially in public 
space as on public transportation or road. The government records people driving for further government research data 
(Purwanti, 2016; Jiow & Morales, 2015).

2472","Coordination among stakeholders is weak; The accident when Gubeng Street was sink in 2018 and was 
successfully resolved not more than one week was one of governmental breakthroughs in public service. Through 
surveillance cameras, the government was able to monitor the roadwork progress. Therefore, the government should 
learn and will be enforced to build coordination among multi-stakeholders in reducing the number of traffic accidents. 
As a leading government in Intelligent Traffic Systems in East Java, Surabaya has collaborated with other regional 
governments to support the implementation of SITS and conducted transferring knowledge. On the other hand, Law 
Enforcement of E-TLE was still considered unsuccessful. The government was not able to integrate data on vehicle 
owners. 
 
Furthermore, it needs coordination among the Transportation office, the police, and other related agencies; otherwise, 
it was only settled for Surabaya (Haq 2019). At last, the number of cameras installed up to 2019 was 23, which were 
able to identify details of violations. In conclusion, there was a need to increase the number of CCTV and improve 
coordination among stakeholders. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that collaborative e-government is significantly necessary to be 
implemented. Additionally, the success in collaborating intelligent traffic systems is influenced by a sustained value-
driven, citizen-driven, economic driven, and technology-driven. This study is expected to contribute to the literature 
as the findings are closely related to multi stakeholders’ theory consisting of government, business, academician, non-
government organization, and mass media. Hence, this model is beneficial to respond to what society needs and to 
create a better collaboration considering the elements of collaborative e-government

Abstract 
 
Islamic bank is a business entity within the scope of Islamic Financial Institutions. The most notable 
difference between Conventional Banks and Islamic Banks lies in the principle of profit obtained by the 
bank and the customer. However, the facts on the ground, the authors find that some customers do not 
understand where the difference in principle lies; many customers feel that it is the same thing. Moreover, 
the transfer of customers from using conventional banks to Islamic banks is followed by the government, 
making people inevitably convert. Therefore, it is one of the problems faced by Islamic banks, where they 
must provide education and understanding to customers, that there is a difference between the two things. 
In conjunction with the present issues, this study is written to analyze the Effect of Products and Human 
Resources on Customer Loyalty in the Post-Conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah, Indonesia. This cross-
sectional study used primary data and obtained from distributing questionnaires to 100 respondents using 
the convenience sampling method. The data analyzed using multiple linear regression by assisting the 
statistical software, namely SPSS-23. The results showed that the product positively and significantly 
influenced Customer Loyalty at the Post-Conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah. Also, human Resources 
positively and significantly influenced Customer Loyalty at the Post-Conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah. 
Simultaneously, Products and Human Resources positively and significantly influenced Customer Loyalty 
at the Post-Conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah. In conclusion, this study has successfully identified that 
product and human resources positively affect customer loyalty at post-conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah, 
Indonesia.

Abstract  
 
Project management highly requires effective leadership in managing resources and people in high 
complexity projects. Despite extensive studies in the areas of project management and studies of leadership, 
the extent to which leadership influences project success has not been fully explored nor have the styles of 
effective leadership in project environments. Failure in managing projects is determined as the main 
challenge due to ineffective leadership in UAE. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a 
leadership model for effective project management. The research adopted a quantitative research approach 
along the research process. The study was carried out within UAE Abu Dhabi National Oil and Gas 
Company (ADNOC). The results for this study were based on questionnaires distributed to the 417 
respondents which are employees in the project management department in ADNOC. the results for this 
study were based on questionnaires distributed to the 417 respondents which are employees in the project 
management department in ADNOC. the data have been gathered were then analyzed using Analysis of 
Moment Structures (AMOS) in Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results show that competency 
leadership, servant leadership, behavioral leadership has a significant impact on the success of project 
management, while situational leadership was found not significant in this study. Thus, the results from this 
study are benefitted the top management of ADNOC, to helps them in deciding on project management in 
an organization.

1. Introduction  
In today’s society, the economy persists due to multiple investments in projects of public as well as private sectors. 
According to Al-Ali et al., (2017), it accounts for heavy construction investment that rounds up to trillions of dollars 
annually. The subject matter of project management relies on comprehensive, result-oriented, and efficient planning 
(Kerzner et al., 2017). The success of project management heavily relies upon the usage of the time limit, budget, and 
capability to handle it. The project is considered fruitful if it is performed according to what it needs to be successful 
(Almatrooshi et al., 2016). In this perspective, the role of the project manager is highly critical to defined and shape 
the desired targets of project execution.

Table 3 shows the result of the hypotheses testing for the direct relationships between the predictors and the 
project management success as well as the Work engagement as mediation. The Table shows the path coefficients, 
the standard error, the critical ratio, and the p-value. As shown in Table 3 situational leadership has no significant 
effect on project management success (β = .034; CR = .742; p =.459), hence the hypothesis is not supported. On other 
hand, the hypothesis that postulated that competency leadership has a significant effect on project management success 
is supported (β = .150; CR = 2.352; p = .019). Similarly, servant leadership is found to have significant but negative 
effect on project management success (β = -.212; CR = -2.482; p = .013) while behavioral leadership also indicated a 
positive significant effect on project management success (β = .362; CR = 5.691; p < .05). 
The mediating effect of work engagement in the relationship between situational, competency, servant, and 
behavioral leaderships with project management success. In testing the hypothesis, the bootstrapping method was 
used. The bootstrapping method of testing the mediation effect is considered the most effective method than the 
conventional Sobel Test (Hayes, 2014). Table 3 shows the result of the mediation analysis conducted via bootstrapping 
method. By re-sampling, the data to 1000 samples as recommended in Cheung and Lau (2008), the total effect, direct 
effect, and indirect effect estimates alongside their respective 95 percent Confidence Interval values, lower and upper 
limits as well as the two-tailed significant values were extracted as shown in Table 3.  
The bootstrapping result presented in Table 3 shows that work engagement significantly mediate the 
relationship between situational leadership and project management success (β = .065; 95% CI: .013 ~ .118; p = .034), 
thus supporting hypothesis H5a. Similarly, work engagement shows a significant mediating effect on the relationship 
between behavioral leadership and project management success (β = .204; 95% CI: .130 ~ .294; p = .002) which 
supports hypothesis H5. On the hand, the result shows no significant mediating effect in the relationship between 
competency leadership and project management success (β = .091; 95% CI: -.006 ~ .188; p = .123), and between 
servant leadership and project management success (β = .108; 95% CI: -.020 ~ .241; p = .169) which indicated that 
both hypotheses H6 and H8 are not supported. 
 
5. Conclusion  
A new model of a leadership model for effective project management in the public organization was to propose a 
framework for an effective privilege approach thereby provided significant insight into how to improve the 
environment of work to achieve the organization objectives. The findings of this research contribute to the UAE 
government. With this new model, it is believed that the government can improve the employee productivity and 
performance of public organizations. SEM models provide a guide for a better understanding of these facilities and 
their interactive behavior. The study contributed to explore how a successful project manager must exercise a wide 
range of critical leadership characteristics and management styles to effectively succeed in project management. Most 
significantly, within the framework of the statistics, the model developed of this research drawn from existing theories 
satisfy all the conditions with the desired level of personalization in the data. This confirms the contributions in all 
respects. Conducting this study is therefore expected to be significant to various stakeholders in the organizations.

Abstract 
 
This research analyzes the influence of the configuration of ensemble learning algorithms’ accuracy when predicting 
the annual production of honey for export in the south of Chile. The research is carried out following a classic 4-stage 
methodology (analysis, design, development, and validation). During the analysis, data is gathered and preprocessed. 
During the design, independent variables, ensemble algorithms, and performance metrics (correlation coefficient, 
MAE and RMSE) are defined. Construction and validation are carried out using the software WEKA. To build the 
models, 9 variables are considered. The dataset is split up in a subset for training and test (80%) and another one for 
validation (20%). The predictions are obtained by means of configuring a stacking scheme as ensemble and 
interchanging a support vector machine, a linear regression, a decision tree, and a Gaussian process as meta or base 
learners. According to the results, while the correlation coefficient between predictions and actual values fluctuates 
significantly in the range of 18% to 46%, MAE does it between 32% and 37%. In conclusion, although being 
inaccurate, results suggests that the arrangement of the meta and base algorithms within the ensemble does affect the 
prediction accuracy.

1. Introduction 
The decline in the population of honeybees is a matter of global concern. Despite such phenomenon, the consume of 
honey increases steadily year after year. In the global honey market, the most important producers and exporters are 
China and Argentine. And the mayor honey importers are United States and Germany. There are several factors that 
influence the production of honey (Rocha, 2017). Some of them are weather conditions, economic factors, and 
environment issues (Delgado et al., 2012). Several predictive models have been proposed in the past to predict the 
production of honey, including the aforementioned factors. From linear regressions to artificial neural networks 
(Çevrimli et al., 2020). This investigation, however, analyzes the influence of the configuration of an ensemble 
learning algorithm on the predictions´ accuracy using information about the annual production of honey for export in 
the southern regions of Chile. 
 
For the purposes of this research historical data from the last 10 years are considered. The dataset is split up in a subset 
for training and test (80%) and another subset for validation (20%). The approach to predict the annual production of 
honey for export considers the development of several predictive models with different configurations. Each model 
consists of an ensemble scheme, a meta-algorithm and three base learners (Valentini and Masulli, 2002). The selected 
algorithms are linear regression, a Gaussian process regression (Wilson et al., 2011), support vector machine (Basak 
et al., 2007; Guenther and Schonlau, 2016; Rivas-Perea, 2013), and the decision tree M5. Since the yearly production

6. Conclusion 
 
Since the performance of predictive models based on machine learning algorithms is the result of a learning process, 
supervised in this case, having a complete and large enough dataset is important. Small datasets, like the one studied 
in this work, might lead to an incomplete learning process and consequently to inaccurate predictions. Even though, 
ensemble schemes are rather complex, the results are not much better than those produced by single algorithms. This 
is a good example that not always an ensemble can overcome the lack of an adequate dataset. Although cross-
validation might help get rid of the partitioning effect that affects the simple hold out, the results in Table 4 show that 
when the dataset is small (50 instances) the selection of a large k (e.g., k=10) might produce folds so small that testing 
results varies significantly. In this case, while the mean of the correlation coefficient is close to 50%, its standard 
deviation is in the range of 30%. 
 
Despite of being minimal, the implementation of an ensemble with four algorithms does produce more consistent 
results than learning schemes acting alone as shown in Table 5 for models 5, 6, 7, and 8. Finally, based on the results, 
it can be concluded that more prediction consistency is achieved when working with ensemble schemes. However, 
their capabilities cannot overcome the lack of an adequate dataset.

Abstract 
 
Judicial reform is an essential reference policy for state administrative courts to change its quality more 
effectively and efficiently. The state administrative court is one of the judicial environments under the 
supreme court that apply technology-based electronic justice in the 4.0 era. It makes it more informative, 
transparent, and accountable. Therefore, the current investigation is written to study the concept of 
technology-based electronic justice in optimising the utilisation of electronic justice in state organisational 
justice, Banda Aceh, Indonesia. This study is designed using qualitative research through normative 
juridical. The data was collected from legal literature studies, such as books, national or international 
journals and interviews with relevant parties, especially state administrative court in Banda Aceh. The result 
of this study is the implementation of the case search information system has marked a significant shift 
from the conventional judiciary to digitalisation. Optimisation efforts have been conducting in the online 
trial process through the equipment needed by the judiciary, selected as a pilot project using electronic 
justice. The trial has been accomplished by doing some training on improving human resources in the 
environment. As a result, it is expecting that e-Court and e-litigation applications would be more efficient.

Abstract 
 
Women are one of the vulnerable groups that needed to empower and always discussed in many spaces. 
This study tried to identify the lack of women backed by structural problems in village policies that do not 
consider women as a class of vulnerable groups become the most crucial part of development. Qualitative 
research with natural methods because it is on the basis of natural conditions. This approach is focusing on 
phenomena or natural settings. The data is collected by interviewing and observing a member of the 
empowerment and family welfare group (PKK). This study found that mothers of households who serve as 
household heads trained to take advantage of what they have to earn additional income. PKK Group 
pioneered the village's opposition by involving themselves completely, both from development planning, 
implementation to the evaluation of performance already underway. The empowerment efforts are not 
arbitrarily successful as expected; the PKK group is precisely dealing with the problem in the internal body 
of the organisation. Many planned work programs often fail because they are affected by internal issues.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia has great biodiversity's and genetic resources and essential natural resources due to its utilisation 
by industry activities as the second-largest megadiversity country. However, industrial activity is identically 
vulnerable in causing biopiracy continuous use and detrimental to the community. The convention on 
biological and Nagoya protocol have recognised the protection of biodiversity and genetic resources 
through accent and benefit-sharing. Of these, Indonesia has ratified two international arrangements 
supported in protecting biodiversity and genetic resources. In line with the issue, the present study aims to 
analyse the importance of protecting biodiversity and genetic resources in Indonesia. The result of the study 
indicated that two reasons underlie the need to preserve biodiversity and genetic resources, i.e., increasing 
economic value and reasons for moral rights to communities around biodiversity and genetic resources. In 
conclusion, the legal protection of biodiversity and genetic resources is crucial for Indonesia. As an island 
nation, Indonesia has a very strategic position with a wealth of natural resources and high endemic species 
of flora and fauna. The richness of biodiversity and genetic resources includes genetics, species, to a variety 
of unique ecosystems. In addition, the use of biodiversity and genetic resources in the activities of the 
cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries has increased the economic value that can bring prosperity to the 
community.

Abstract 
 
COVID-19 has been rapidly spread worldwide since March 2020 and has caused uncertainty in many sectors, 
including stock market. Aligned with the previous studies, Government responses toward the crisis are matter in 
offsetting the effects of the pandemic. Henceforth, we examine the relationship of Stock market return with lockdown 
policies amidst the pandemic. In specific, this study analyses COVID-19 Government Response Stringency Index, as 
the primary drivers of stock market movements, and add other country-level indicators are as a control variable. We 
focus on emerging stock market countries since it has been a number one alternative for global investors diversified 
their portfolios. Moreover, there is still lack of extend research on how Government’s role affects the stock market 
return in selected countries during the 1-year of COVID-19 pandemic. In total, there are 26 emerging stock markets’ 
monthly return within a period from March 2020 to February 2021, employed in this research. It is believed that the 
Index has a negative significant relationship with the stock markets’ return.

1. Introduction  
In the beginning of 2020, the world was shocked by the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19. 
The virus rapidly emerged globally from Wuhan, China. On the 11th of March of 2020, World Health Organization 
(WHO) declared the COVID-19 as a global pandemic1. In order to reduce the transmission of the virus, the government 
around the world took unprecedented actions following the guidance from the WHO, including closures policy2. The 
restriction policy is proven in reducing the growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths (Liu et al. 2021). However, the 
lockdown policy also affects economic sector, such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price reached negative level at 
-$37/barrel as a result of the global oil demand drop during the cessation of economic activities3. Considering the fact 
that there are differences in socio-culture, capacity of the government, etc. Thus, the progression in tackling the 
COVID-19 of each country worldwide would be different. In order to compare the stringent policy levels taken by 
respective governments the authors use the Stringency index created by OxCGRT (Oxford COVID-19 Government 
Response Tracker) which is an average level of nine generic closure policies worldwide (Hale et al. 2021). 
In regard to the differences of COVID-19 response’ economic impact worldwide, Latin America’s GDP was 
predicted to decline by approximately -9.4% with a rising number of unemployed populations by 18 million people in 
FY 20204. Furthermore, in Africa region, the tourism sector was severely affected by COVID-19 with a 46% decrease 
in total of tourist numbers (Elbany and Elhenawy 2021). And also the GDP fell by 51% Quarter over Quarter (QoQ) 
in the second quarter of 2020 and there was a projection of 77 million Africans people will fall into poverty level if 
the lockdown policy prolonged (Lakemann et al., 2020). The economic growth of developing Asian countries were

Abstract 
 
As a primary agricultural commodity, cocoa is the essential commodity and source of income for 
farmers, workers, and companies in terms of its supply chain. In Indonesia, cocoa is a commodity 
number three after coconut palm oil and rubber. Therefore, it plays a crucial role in creating job 
opportunities, which focusing on agribusiness and domestic agroindustry, environmental conservation, 
and regional development. In conjunction with the significant contribution of cocoa as an agricultural 
commodity, this study seeks to investigate the cocoa commodity competitiveness dynamics in Indonesia 
and Ivory Coast before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. This study calculates the data of export 
using a four-digit Harmonized System (HS) on the basis of the United Nations' Standard International 
Trade Classification (SITC) from 2016 to 2020. In determining the country's competitiveness, this study 
applies the Balassa Revealed Comparative Advantage (BRCA). This study indicates that the 
competitive dynamics of cocoa commodities occurred in Indonesia and Ivory Coast before and during 
the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, the chocolate industry network should promote good governance for 
improving sustainable agricultural resources, including fair and inclusive labour policy and green 
supply chains incentives. Also, creating a better policy climate for effective agricultural management 
and developing a downstream chocolate industry should be crucial for both countries.

1. Introduction 
Cocoa is the main agricultural commodity for most countries globally, both as a country exporter and importer. 
For many countries, cocoa is an important source of income for the state as well as farmers and all workers and 
companies in the supply chain. For Indonesia, cocoa is a commodity number three foreign exchange-producing 
agriculture after coconut palm oil and rubber. The main source of income for 1.7 million heads of farming actors 
scattered in almost all provinces and 81 thousand. Employee families' large plantations play a role in creating 
employment opportunities, encouraging agribusiness and domestic agroindustry, environmental conservation, and 
regional development (Ariningsih et al., 2010). According to International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), amount 
of cocoa consumed worldwide can be described from the grinding data, namely the number of cocoa beans that 
are processed into products semi-finished/intermediate/semi-finished, which in the form of paste (liquor), fat 
(butter), and powder (powder). The grinding of cocoa is carried out in Europe (especially in the Netherlands and 
Germany), Africa (especially in Ivory Coast and Ghana), America (especially in the United States and Brazil), 
and Asia and Oceania (especially in Indonesia and Indonesia Malaysia). However, countries that do grinding

2522","Consequently, many workers will reduce the consumption budget and minimise the purchase of secondary 
and tertiary needs. Chocolate will be placed in a non-priority position for daily consumption (Abdoellah, 2021). 
The substantial shocks affected by the Covid pandemic will decrease revenue and loss potential market, which 
are initially influenced by travel prohibitions, lockdown, and production limitations. There will be new challenges 
for cocoa producers in the new normal era, including significant changes in business landscape, use of e-
commerce, and consumer education. Therefore, countries should adopt a new strategy in winning the market 
competition (Cadby, 2021)  
Shortly, cocoa networks must maintain in good governance mechanism. The chocolate industry that gained 
higher added value in cocoa production process should consider accountability, fairness, and transparency in the 
whole production process. It can be implemented when the cocoa industry considers farmers' revenue and 
sustainable rural development (Daniels et al., 2012). Through governance reforms collaboration, the existing 
sustainability and ethical challenge that is well known in this industry can be addressed and resolved for the 
sustainability of the chocolate industry that creates prosperity for all parties (Thorlakson, 2018). It can be 
implemented when cocoa producer's country develops multi-stakeholder partnerships in creating global 
engagement of all cocoa and chocolate stakeholders to ensure the implementation of a sustainable cocoa market. 
 
4 Conclusion 
Indonesia and Ivory Coast have experienced international trade dynamics in Cacao commodities since the last 
decades. Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia have contributed around 70 percent of cocoa production in the world. 
According to the BRCA analysis, both countries have enjoyed strong competitiveness mainly from raw material 
or semi-finished cocoa commodities. For instance, Indonesia has a strong and medium comparative advantage for 
cocoa paste, whether or not defatted, as well as cocoa oil, fat and butter. While Ivory Coast is competitive in 
producing cocoa skins, shells, husks, and other cocoa waste, and cocoa beans, roasted or raw, broken or whole. 
Unfortunately, both countries experienced weak competitiveness in processed or final cocoa commodities such as 
chocolate and all food preparations with cocoa ingredients (HS-1806). For Indonesia, international trade revenues 
from cocoa commodities are profitable, especially for semi-processed cocoa products. For Ivory Coast, as it is the 
major cocoa exporter product globally, it depended on market stability to gain from trade. Furthermore, Ivory 
Coast and Indonesia should increase the added value of cocoa commodities by developing the downstream 
chocolate industry.  It could be realised if both countries focus more on increasing their human development 
capacity in chocolate production.  Moreover, the dynamics of international trade should be considered that all 
stakeholders in those countries have to perform well, ignore business as usual efforts, overcome the problem of 
child labour, and create sustainable agriculture resources.

Abstract 
The research was carried out to investigate wastewater discharge's technical viability from wet coffee processing plant 
(WCPP) treatments with aeration and Typha- latifolia plant. The WCPP wastewater was conducted at various aeration 
days (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days) after being irrigated for 21 days in the constructed wetland with Typha-latifolia plant 
and without a plant. The highest value of total solids, chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand 
increasing were 87.8%, 97.4% and, 98.1%, respectively, in 25 days aerated with Typha-latifolia plant wetland. The 
Typha-latifolia with 25 days aerated WCPWW reduced 94.2% and 98.1% of NO3-N and PO43, respectively. As a 
result, the aeration days were increased with the removal efficiency of pollutants discharged from wet coffee 
processing plant increased with a constructed wetland with Typha-latifolia. It shows that aeration with constructed 
wetland treatment method was a low-cost, affordable, technically viable and eco-friendly treatment option for the wet 
coffee processing plant wastewater.  
Key Words: Aeration, Constructed wetland, Coffee processing wastewater, Removal capacity and 
Wastewater                            treatment. 
1. Introduction 
In Ethiopia, more than 1,249 wet coffee processing plants were constructed near water bodies because the industries 
need a lot of water to wash wet coffee bean, removing the pulp and the mucilage (Dadi et al. 2018). The wastewater 
discharges from the process of wet coffee plants are directly into nearby streams and rivers without treatment, and it 
is the cause of environmental pollution and human health (Beyene 2014). Due to the problems, it is essential to treat 
wastewater discharge from wet coffee processing plant by using aeration with constructed wetland treatment before 
effluent to an environment. The pollutant parameters were characterized from October 1, 2020, to February 30, 2021, 
at Jimma University, Environmental Health Science and Technology Laboratory, Ethiopia.   
1.2. Objective of the study 
The main objective of this study to investigate wet coffee processing plant wastewater discharges treatment using 
aeration with wetland technology. 
2. Literature Review 
Coffee is a popular beverage and highly cultivated crops worldwide, and it is the largest consumed and traded 
commodity globally (Murty and Nadu 2012; Zerihun et al 2018; Ghosh, 2008). About 80 countries worldwide were 
cultivated coffee plantation and contributed to the world business sector (Murty and Nadu 2012). More than 8.2 million

days increase due to additional supply of O2 it is improved the degradation of organic matters.  Vishnumurthi (2004), 
described that removed 98.98% BOD5 from domestic wastewater due to the aeration process. 
The removal efficiency of TS decreased with aeration days decreased by 87.8% for 25 days, 80.1% for 20 days, 73.2% 
for 15 days, 66.8% for ten days and 65.7% for five days.  Choudhury et al. (1998), the removal capacity of TS was 
54% wastewater from Kraft paper by batch aeration. 
5.3.3. Constructed wetland treatment of WCPWW 
The aerated CPWW with 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 days were irrigated for Typha-latifolia  and Control without plants for 
21 days. The effluents result indicated that (in Table 4) from Typha-latifolia plants remove 98.1% of BOD5 in aerated 
with 25 days WCPWW. A similar study indicated that the removal capacity of BOD5 was 75% with the wetland 
process (Cooper 1993; Vymazal 2005). The TS removal efficiency of 87.8 % was shown in aerated 25 days CPWW 
treated with Typha-latifolia. The removal of total suspended solid shows in between75% to 89%. Sapkota and Bavor 
(1994), the removal capacity of total suspended solid in between 30% to 86% in gravel-based sub surface ﬂow process. 
5.4. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis 
 
The XRD analysis result is shown in Fig.2. The XRD analysis of the original soil before treatment and the sludge after 
treatment in constructed wetland shows that polymeric compounds present in the raw materials.  All type of filling 
materials to constructed wetland system reveal diffuse peaks in the spectrum that peaks indicated the amorphous 
crystalline in nature and the soil contain metals (Ghosh et al 2008). A few small humps were described in the original 
soil's range and treated soil without plants (control that indicated an amorphous phase.

Abstract 
Modern production systems in modern industries are constructed with one or more support lines, such as 
rework, parallel, assembly line, and so on, to satisfy their objectives. Producing a rejected part is a common 
issue in manufacturing processes. Rework path (RP) is one of the most common types of production paths 
used to repair rejected parts and return them to the main line for reprocessing. The ideal buffer size in front 
of each machine tool bay in both branches of the production system should be optimized to create an 
efficient production system, including the main production line with rework path (MPL-RP). The 
optimization of buffer size of the system leads to the improvement in their overall performance, 
management, and operations. The key criteria influencing the buffer size decision and hence the MPL-RP 
production rate are the characteristics of machine tools, particularly their uptimes and downtimes. An 
efficient optimization model (EOM) is conceived in this study to determine the buffer size between each 
two neighboring machine tools in MPL-RP at any given uptimes and downtimes. To determine the ideal 
buffer size of the MPL and its RP, EOM employs a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization model. The 
suggested method can estimate the ideal buffer size in an acceptable period of time, as demonstrated in the 
numerical examples, for small and large production lines, included in this study. As a result, when compared 
to previous selection approaches, the buffer sizes can be selected in a short span of time. The suggested 
approach can assist manufacturing engineers in making decisions during the design of new MPL-RP 
systems, as well as be utilized to improve the working of existing MPL-RP systems.

1. Introduction 
Production line, also known as a flow line, is a production system consists of a number of machines that are 
sequentially connected in series with buffers between each two neighboring machines (Shi and Gershwin 2009). 
Defective parts which must be rejected, are frequently produced during the production process in an industry. The 
reworking of the declined part is highly recommended to enhance the productivity of the process. This can be achieved 
through adopting main production line with rework path (MPL-RP), which is one of the most common types of 
production systems in modern plants. It is capable of repairing the defective parts through rework path in the system. 
The repaired parts will be returned to the main line after reprocessing through rework path. Adoption of this production

6. Conclusion  
This paper has presented the implementation of an accurate and generic optimization algorithm to estimate 
the optimal values of the buffer size and productivity of production lines with a rework path. The results show that the 
algorithm carried out the prediction/optimization values at any given uptimes and downtimes values and can perform 
the desired task with large and small production lines without restriction to a specific number of machines. The 
algorithm was tested in two case studies of parameter settings with small and large production lines. The results of the 
small production line show that case study 1 (same values of uptime and downtime parameters) gave a higher 
productivity than those obtained in case 2 (random selection of uptime and downtime parameters). However, in the 
large production line, the algorithm identified buffer sizes in case of random selection of uptime and downtime that 
gave higher productivity than those for the case where same values of uptime and downtime for the sub lines are 
considered. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable to estimate the buffer size of SPL with a 
rework path. It is worth emphasizing that the proposed algorithm can be integrated with other software libraries 
because it is quite fast approach and can help the user make the rapid decisions with regard to the buffer size for the 
design of production lines. For future work, the authors aim to deploy this algorithm on an embedded system board 
and integrated it as an internet of things node within an Industry 4.0 framework.

Abstract 
 
The authority of prosecutors in handling criminal cases alternatively in the Indonesian judicial system is 
very important to investigate. Therefore, it needs to be regulated in the draft revision of Law Number 16 of 
2004 on the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Indonesia. Thus, in the draft amendment to the 
Prosecutor's Office, it must accommodate the values, customs and laws that live in the environment of 
society in the framework of the NKRI, which is Bhineka Tungga Ika, under Pancasila as the basis of Idil 
and the 1945 Constitution as the Constitutional Foundation of the Republic of Indonesia. Furthermore, this 
study found that the prosecutor's role is as a public prosecutor and as a mediator in resolving minor criminal 
cases alternatively as one of the solutions to anticipate the swelling of prison inmates and the swelling of 
the budget for inmates.

1. Introduction 
 
The increasing trend of companies deriving their value from intangible assets seems to be set to continue, as more 
businesses invest in particularly intangible assets property to create new products and services (Allerslev et al, 2017). 
With the development of technology and the globe in terms of business, intangible assets, such as goodwill, lenience, 
copyright, patent, knowledge, skills, relationship, processes, and culture, vital strategic resources have become key 
drivers for improving businesses, economic growth and supporting the businesses growth of organizations (Mehta, 
and Madhani, 2009). Rita (2017) concluded that the activities of the company are related to different types of 
resources, among which intangible assets are becoming an increasingly important incentive for the company to 
operate. At the end of the twentieth century, the increased interest in intangible assets and its impact on the market 
value of companies encouraged companies to increase their investment in human resources, research, and 
development, new technologies, etc. Intangible assets have emerged as leading assets due to the transformation of 
industries from manufacturing base to service base driven by knowledge workers among the industrialized countries 
worldwide. The subject intangible means it does not have physical substance, but grants rights of ownership to the

Abstract 
 
In the digital era, marketing plays a crucial role in creating the confidence to launch a new product rather 
than entering the market without exposure. For every business, marketing is essential to ensure long-term 
customer relationships with the organization's products or services. Therefore, the marketing system has 
switched from conventional to digital-based technology (online marketing). Following Indonesia's vision, 
a creative economy developed to promote creative digital marketing, particularly for small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs). Innovation through digital marketing brings out a variety of changes in the 4.0 
era. It will change the paradigm by marketing digital technology and driving up creative business economic 
factors. The various marketing programs and community benefits in the region will be improved, allowing 
these communities to enter the global market digitally in both areas. Thus, the present study aims to 
investigate innovative commercial marketing in the digital era 4.0. This qualitative study conducted through 
survey questionnaires, observation, and interviews. It intended to better understand natural phenomena by 
emphasizing the process of deep communication interaction between researchers and the phenomenon 
under study. The study's findings can lead to social developments in the two regions of Lhokseumawe and 
Central Aceh. Technological innovations in the transformation era and creative economy-based MSMEs 
can produce innovative products and various breakthrough sectors of the economy in global markets.  
Government intervention and SMEs and society must create jobs in the future and work closely with related 
parties to advance in the business world. The outcomes of MSMEs based on online marketing have the 
potential to generate competitiveness in the field. As a result, the two regions will serve as pilot districts in 
the digital marketing sector. Most importantly, the two regions' success far outpaced that of other areas. 
Several areas continue to rely on traditional or manual methods, and some entrepreneurs have been unable 
to increase their income.

Abstract 
 
In order to earn more money in less time in this pandemic period, the ultimate option is to invest some amount in 
the stock market. If we invest more then we will have more profit whenever we invest in a good company. In 
Stock exchange, the goal is to understand the future worth of the economic stock. The recent trend in stock market 
prediction innovations is making use of machine learning that makes forecasts based up on the worth’s of present 
stock exchange indices by training on their previous values. Our work analyzes machine learning algorithms and 
also say the best algorithms for predicting stock values. Also comparing results of four algorithms namely Linear 
Regression, LSTM, k –nearest neighbors, fb-prophet algorithms. Factors considered are open, close, high, date 
and last. Furthermore, the proposed work examines the use of the prediction system in real-world settings and 
also problems related to the precision of the overall worth are given, also provides a machine-learning model to 
forecast the long life of stock in a open market. The effective forecast of the stock will certainly be a excellent 
possession for stock exchange organizations as well as will certainly provide real-life solutions stock capitalists 
encounter.

1. Introduction  
Stock exchange prediction is the act of trying to identify future value of a business stock. The successful forecast 
of a stocks future rate might yield considerable earnings. The stock exchange is combination of both customers 
and vendors. The trying to identify the future worth of a stock exchange is stock exchange forecast. The prediction 
must be expected to be durable, accurate and efficiency [2] The system must be adapted to real world establishing 
and real-world circumstances. The system is anticipated to take into account of all variables that may affect the 
supply's value and also efficiency. There are various methods and methods of carrying out the forecast system 
like artificial intelligence, technological evaluation and time collection aspect structuring. Artificial intelligence 
includes artificial intelligence which permits the system to discover and boost from previous experiences without 
being configured time to time. The supply rate movements over a long period of time typically develop a straight 
contour.[6] Individuals pick to buy those stocks whose costs are expected to increase in the future. As a result of 
upside and also drawback movements of stock price, usually people are afraid to purchase stocks. Hence, we need 
to precisely anticipate stock exchange price which can be utilized in the real-world situation. Anticipating methods 
like direct regression, long short-term memory, fb prophet, k nearest neighbor is made use of in this task.

Long Short-Term Memory 
LSTMs are commonly used for sequence prediction problems and have actually shown to be exceptionally 
efficient. The factor they function so well is because LSTM is able to save past info that is important, and neglect 
the info that is not. 
LSTM has 3 gates: 
i) 
The input gate: The input gateway includes details to the cell state 
ii) 
The fail to remember gate: It eliminates the information that is no more needed by the version 
iii) 
The output entrance: Result Gate at LSTM selects the details to be shown as result [1]

4.1 RMSE scores 
The RMSE is the square root of the difference of the residuals. It indicates the outright fit of the design to the 
data-- just how close the observed data factors are to the design's anticipated values. 
RMSE can be taken the standard deviation of the unusual difference, as well as has the beneficial property of 
remaining in the exact same units as the reaction variable. Reduced worth’s of RMSE indicate much better fit. 
RMSE is an excellent measure of how properly the design forecasts the reaction, and also it is the most crucial 
requirement for fit if the primary function of the design is prediction. 
 
5. Conclusion 
By gauging the RMSE of the various algorithms, we discovered that one of the most suitable formulas for 
predicting the market cost of a supply based on various information points from the historical data is the LSTM 
algorithm. The formula will be a terrific possession for brokers as well as capitalists for spending money in the 
securities market since it is educated on a significant collection of historical information and also has actually 
been picked after being evaluated on sample information. The job demonstrates the maker learning version to 
forecast the supply value with more precision as compared to formerly carried out device learning versions.

Abstract  
 
Brassicaceae, previously Cruciferae, is a flowering plant family that includes 338 genera and 3,700 species. 
Members of the family are economically important but domestically altered by humans. The taxonomic 
information of Parlatoria cakiloidea is ambiguous. Presently, no standard criteria to identify the species into 
simple entities for taxonomic, conservation and pharmacognostic studies. The study aimed to taxonomically 
identified  Parlatoria cakiloidea. Fourteen herbarium specimens of P. cakiloidea were examined from Salahaddin 
University using Unsupervised multivariate analysis. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis were 
constructed using software SIMCA-P (V.14.1 Umetrics Sweden). The multivariate analysis established the 
relationship (similarities and discrimination)  that existed. Parlatoria cakiloidea were found to be divided into 
four major groups   in Kurdistan region of Iraq. The information provided will serve as the basis for standardization 
for drug exploration from P. cakiloidea in Kurdistan. The study recommends further study on the anatomical 
features, de novo sequence and the chemical constituents of the species.

1. Introduction  
Medicinal plants are natural resources that produce valuable herbal products that are frequently used in the 
treatment of a variety of ailments (Bjørklund et al., 2018). The therapeutic, preventative, and curative 
characteristics of the medicinal plants under inquiry have been widely described in Ayurveda and have been 
employed since ancient times (Süntar, 2019). Because quite diverse species can be found under the same 
vernacular name, great attention should be devoted to the precise botanical identification of the materials and the 
thorough collecting of voucher specimens (Mahmoud et al., 2020). Chemometrics is used to analyze plants in a 
comprehensive and simultaneous manner. Chemometrics' novel technique have aided in the advancement of plant 
identification studies for herbal and medication formulation (Chiriac et al., 2021). Chemometrics is an effective 
approach in plant science for analyzing and identifying various plants and its component (De Carvalho et al., 
2018). The number of plant species is estimated to exceed 1,600,000 all over the world. The method is 
computational, and it employs multivariate analysis to statistically process numerical or metabolite data 
(Abdulrahman et al. , 2021). To make it easier to identify them, divide them into groups. Principal component 
analysis (PCA), orthogonal projections to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), and hierarchical 
cluster analysis (HCA) are examples of discrimination analysis (Bajer et al., 2020). Multivariate analyses generate 
score plots and loading plots, also known as discrimination maps, to reduce data and interpret it visually (Madiona 
et al., 2018). Presently, taxonomic classification is aided by numerical taxonomy (Winston, 2018). Multivariate 
approaches are commonly used to determine the evolutionary relationships between different species (Tucker et 
al., 2018). Many authors have examined the interrelationships among flowering plant genera and families using 
various numerical taxonomic methods. A medicinal plant complex is a group of species that share common names, 
morphological features, and medicinal uses (Haider, 2018). A medicinal plant complex is a group of species that 
share common names, morphological features, and medicinal uses (Abdulrahman et al.,  2018). Traditionally, P. 
cakiloidea is used in treating various ailments but our surprised no scientific investigation on the said plants in 
Kurdistan and other part of the world to the best of our literature search. To protect consumers from contamination, 
it is critical to have good quality control for medicinal herbs (Abdulrahman et al., 2018; Fibigr et al.,  2018; 
Steinhoff, 2019). Traditional medicine has a significant impact on a population's overall health. Due to the 
misidentification of the plant and it is mixtures can pose a health risk. The study aimed at numerical taxonomic

Based on the phenetic, the researchers were able to fully differentiate P. cakiloidea. The study proved that there 
is a strong association depending on the species' location, but it also showed that there is intra variance within the 
same species gathered at the same area, despite their associations.

Abstract 
This study is a research program on the implementation of the Total Quality Management (TQM) framework in 
the readymade garments (RMG) manufacturing industries detailing the order in which quality tools and techniques 
should be implemented. This study aims to implement TQM and determine whether and how the application of 
Total Quality Management (TQM) practices can improve organizational and quality performance in the 
readymade (RMG) garments manufacturing industries. The study suggests implementing the TQM framework to 
develop quality performances within the ready-made garments (RMG) industries in Bangladesh by applying and 
analysing, various quality tools, techniques, and TQM approaches The research methodology adopted a 
comprehensive literature review on TQM, followed by a questionnaire survey. 
A self-completion questionnaire was designed and perception-based data were collected from a sample of three 
hundred and twenty-two (322) readymade garment (RMG) firms, from greater Dhaka city Bangladesh 
(BGMEA, 2018-19). Quantitative data analysis is being adopted, following a questionnaire survey within RMG 
industries to collect primary data, from 06 (six) different places of greater city Dhaka, in Bangladesh by self-
designed questionnaires, and analysed through statistical software i.e. SPSS and AMOS (SEM). Secondary data 
is to be collected from articles, journals, various ministry websites of Bangladesh, and related online resources. 
The research study covers a wide range of various concepts of quality. TQM is defined and illustrated by various 
authors and scholars. The literature part also includes detailed discussion, benefits, justification, and hindrances 
of TQM implementation. Researcher practices SPSS-25 & AMOS (for SEM) software to carry out various tests 
for data analysis, such as reliability and validity, descriptive statistics, frequency distribution, p-test, chi-square, 
ordinal logistic method (OLM), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), factor loading, average variance extracted 
(AVE), discriminant validity tests to find out proper findings for justifying the research study. 
1. Introduction
Quality holds significant importance in the world trade of garments. After phasing out of MFA (Multi-Fiber 
Agreement), Bangladesh Garment manufacturing trade is competing with other countries for the market share in 
the world without quotas. Quality as the number one source of competitive advantage for garments export (Rashid 
et al. 2016). The product line of RMG is a complex array of styles, seasons, varying life cycles, and 
multidimensional sizing. Many garments firms are upgrading their quality control procedure to be more 
competitive in the world market (Nuruzzaman 2015). Total Quality Management (TQM) refers to organization 
wide effort to achieve quality. It can accurately be described as a philosophy about quality that suggest for 
involving everyone in the organization in a quest for quality. It extends to suppliers as well as to customers. In 
fact, in TQM, the customer is the focal point, as the business is driven by customers. As such, customer’s 
satisfaction is the main driving force. Everyone in the organization, form the top most chief executive to the 
bottom most workers, has to take part in this endeavour. TQM requires all employees of the organization for 
improving the products, processes and services (Islam & Haque 2012). All employees, no matter what role, are 
responsible for quality and quality assurance. The research attempts to fill the gap in literature of TQM, essential 
aspects of TQM elements in the readymade garments (RMG) trade in Bangladesh and it is expected to be the 
beginning of further investigation and related studies.

et al. (2018) which proposed that customers focus has a significant impact on development of new products. 
Rejikumar and Saha (2019) also endorse that customers’ focus moderated the relationship between services 
quality and customers’ satisfaction. Based on findings and extant literature the hypothesis H3 is accepted. In the 
light of significance of continuous improvement and customer focus satisfaction, the study accepts hypothesis H2 
and H3. 
 
11. Contributions of the Study 
The results of this study would contribute greatly to the understanding of total quality management (TQM) in the 
readymade garments (RMG) manufacturing industry. In particular to those firms anticipating to implement extent 
of total quality management tools and techniques in their total quality journey. It would also be of great benefit to 
those people involved in the nurturing of the competitiveness of the company and in the introduction and 
implementation of total quality management in particular. In general, the results i.e. findings of this study may 
contribute as the survey questionnaire and data’s could be used in future study, ISO 9000/9001 is the launching 
pad for implementing extent level TQM, performance of local firms may improve considerably with increase in 
foreign ownership, membership to a quality association/body (local, internationally) contributes to better practice 
and performance, RMG firms with higher practice and performance in TQM employed an increasing array of 
methods to communicate quality to its employees, and employ higher number of elements in their reward system. 
 
12. Limitations of the study 
There are some limitations of our study. First, the response rate, it is not poor but need to be improved. Actually 
it is very difficult to overcome such situation. Second, survey result, it is based on the context of Bangladeshi 
RMG sector (Talapatra, S., & Uddin, 2018). Therefore, these findings cannot be conveyed directly to other sectors, 
because these obstacles occur to varying degree with frequency in the context of different types of RMG firms. 
There is another scope of integrating different organizational theories with this model so that the organization can 
obtain more knowledge from the investigation of new TQM obstacles (Syduzzaman & Yeasmin, 2018). This 
research has some limitations and these limitations of the research are presented as follows: 
 Since the TQM as a topic is almost new in developing countries, and never been fully implemented in 
the apparel manufacturing industry in Bangladesh, the literature review is based on the existing work 
done in the developed countries.  
 The proposed TQM framework is to be applied in a few RMG manufacturing industry as its very vast 
concept and needs to change the whole factory set-up gradually.  
 
13. Conclusion 
TQM is a catalytic tool for achieving excellence in the practice of management. Its continuous improvement 
principle gives it a dynamism by which organizations can anticipate, meet and surpass customer expectations. 
However, its implementation requires the presence of a culture—of ethical conduct, of integrity and of trust— 
that harmonize with its principles (Alaskari. O, & Pinedo-Cuenca. R., 2012). In the last few decades the concepts 
and frameworks of total quality management (TQM) are warmly welcomed in developed countries, however, 
industries in gradually developing nations like Bangladesh remained unacquainted with such initiatives. To 
implement TQM framework successfully, in the RMG industries as well as to improve their performance this 
study indicates some necessary steps (Akter, P., 2016). The study still have some analysis and findings to 
investigate. Though several points can be obtained from the above discussions and study (Syduzzaman, 2014) 
which are listed as follows- 
 Leadership including top management commitment is first and crucial factor for implementing TQM;  
 Continuous improvement which is the main goal of TQM can be achieved through training and 
teamwork;  
 To motivate employees, supplier, customers and stakeholders concept of TQM is indispensable; 
 If it can be ensured continuous improvement, then a culture will develop that will help to build 
relationship among management, employee, supplier and customer; 
 To assure product quality and maintain other related activities by using total quality management in the 
organization (Mazumder et al. 2011). 
 
The current pragmatic literature on TQM is subjugated by empirical studies in the framework of developed 
western countries, but one can just hardly find any wide-ranging research in the context of a developing country, 
like Bangladesh. Implementing a framework on TQM, the present study can help in: 
 
Understanding the awareness of TQM or any other quality program in Bangladesh service sector. 
 
Investigating the TQM implementation experiences in Bangladesh service sector.  
 
Identification of the key TQM practices for effective TQM implementation in Bangladesh business 
sector.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this work is to apply a strategy for reducing the inventory replenishment cycle time for a 
Mexican Convenience Store Supply Chain. This strategy is structured with the aim of reducing the store 
inventory level from about 30 days on average. This work describes the efforts of the company to decrease 
the delivery cycle time by increasing the inventory replenishment frequency in the Metropolitan Monterrey 
area. Results of simulation and pilot studies of implementing the suggested initiatives are provided. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction  
The convenience store (C- S) sector occupies the position 20 among the top 250 retailing institutions in the world (The 
Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and the Grocery Manufacturers of America (GMA), 2000). How do the small, corner 
convenience stores compete against retail giants like Walmart and e-retailer Amazon? Food, fuel, and fast service are 
paving the way, and it all comes down to that key word: “convenience.” The National Association of Convenience 
Stores (NACS) defines a convenience store as: “a retail business with primary emphasis on providing the public a 
convenient location to quickly purchase from a wide array of consumable products (predominantly food or food and 
motor fuels) and services (Gerke Economics 1989). The average convenience store size is about 2,744 square feet, yet 
it serves as a one-stop destination for food, refreshments, tobacco products, motor fuels, and a wide variety of other 
items (NACS).  
 
The Mexican C-S sector with total sales of 8500 million dollars, was positioned 11th among the biggest world markets 
in year 2014. These revenue was generated by 17,450 stores operating throughout Mexico. The leading company in 
this sector contributed with 12,853 stores and a market share of 88% in that year. This firm will be called “The One” 
hereafter. One of the greatest challenges for The One to be competitive refers to inventory management. This is the 
key to maintain high levels of product availability and ensure customer satisfaction. This aspect represents an 
important weakness for “The One”. The average level of store inventory for “The One” is estimated in slightly higher 
than 40 days which is considered very high considering replenishment cycles of seven days.   
 
This work has the purpose of describing the efforts of “The One” to decrease the level of inventory in the stores by 
increasing their inventory replenishment frequency and reducing their order cycle time in the area of metro Monterrey. 
The document is structured as follows. The first section presents an introduction and general context. Second section 
describes a summary of bibliographic research relevant to the problem of interest. The following section provides a 
description of the general methodology followed to treat the problem. Then, the application of this methodology is 
given in the fourth section, followed by the fifth section of results and conclusions.

1","5. Implementation of improvement initiatives 
The initial stage of the implementation of the improvement strategy consisted on using the scheme for estimating the 
optimal delivery frequencies for 1588 stores located in metro Monterrey. Table 1 illustrates the resulting optimal 
delivery frequencies for the stores achieved with the scheme. The number of stores with 2 visits per week decreases 
95%. These stores increase their frequency visits mainly to 5.

Originally, the next step of the implementation of the improvement strategy would correspond to a pilot program for 
a statistically significant sample of stores with delivery frequency of five.  However, in order to proceed, it was also 
necessary that the DC operations could support the changes required to enable increased delivery frequencies. Due to 
this obstacle, the authors decided to proceed the work developing a simulation of the routing operations (Fatima et al. 
2020) under the scenario with stores having delivery frequency of five times per week and located in plaza centro. 
The simulation included the use of an Oracle routing software. Figure 6 presents the routes designed with the previous 
system.

Table 2 presents the impact of increasing delivery frequency of stores to 5 times per week. According to the simulation 
the expected impact on inventory level is a decrease of 21.3%. Customer service in terms of stockout level and the 
percentage of lost sales could be decreased 43.5%. The expected impact on the distribution scheme is also illustrated 
in table 2. The original average number of total routes is reduced 52%, the average number of stores per route increases 
52% and the distance between stores per route is also reduced 51%.

6. Conclusions and recommendations 
The work described in the document focuses on the efforts undertaken by the leading Mexican Convenience Store 
company to reduce inventory costs at the store level. The strategy delineated by the management of operations

6","consisted on the increase of the delivery frequency of replenishing the stores. Originally 76% of the stores at the 
national level were supplied from their distribution center twice per week. 
 
Reviewing some of the favorable conditions that allowed Seven Eleven Japan and America to supply stores daily, 
“The One” considered that store density was fundamental. High store density supports the feasibility of higher 
frequency values. Hence, the first step taken in the project was to obtain store density maps. Metro Monterrey, Saltillo, 
CDMX and Guadalajara present the areas with the highest densities showing higher possibilities for increasing 
delivery frequency. Then, the operations management team decided to evaluate the feasibility of higher delivery 
frequencies in the area of metro Monterrey. The following steps taken included the application of the methodology 
described previously in section 4.1. The results of this application suggest that the number of stores with 2 visits per 
week decreases 95%. These stores increase their frequency visits mainly to 5 times per week reaching 79%. Finally, 
because a pilot project was very difficult to undertake a simulation model was developed to evaluate the feasibility of 
the resulting optimal scenario. After reviewing the previous results illustrated in the last section, the management of 
operations of the company had shown great interest to continue towards the implementation of the project. 
 
The authors of this project recommend the continuation of the application of the strategy designed and evaluated for 
decreasing store inventory levels. Another recommendation of the authors focuses on extending lower delivery 
frequencies for the suppliers of the DC´s of “The One”.

Abstract 
 
We are in the brink of the next disruptive technology in the automobile revolution. The autonomous vehicles will have 
the direct impact on our society and the way we move and live.  The autonomy means ""autos"" (self) and ""nomos (rule). 
The definition of autonomy is the ability of an individual to make a rational, uninfluenced decision. The autonomous 
vehicle must follow the principles of autonomy like humans, making fair decisions at all situations. To navigate to a 
given destination based on passenger provided instructions, autonomous vehicle must observe, understand, model, 
infer, and predict behavior of the surrounds like, weather, animals, debris, follow the traffic rules and signals,  and the 
humans inside and outside the car and finally make a split-second decision. The social, economic, ethical, human 
behavior, urban and suburban landscape, insurance, legal and liability, and ethnographical effects are enormous.  
These aspects must be considered for the development of the autonomous vehicle. This paper would examine the 
challenges in developing autonomous vehicle.

1. Introduction 
World Health Organization (WHO, 2018) Global status report on road safety 2018, highlights that the number of 
annual road traffic deaths has reached 1.35 million. Road traffic injuries are now the leading killer of people aged 5-
29 years. The burden is disproportionately borne by pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, in particular those living 
in developing countries. The report suggests that the price paid for mobility is too high, especially because proven 
measures exist. Drastic action is needed to put these measures in place to meet any future global target that might be 
set and save lives. An increase in average speed is directly related both to the likelihood of a crash occurring and to 
the severity of the consequences of the crash. For example, every 1% increase in mean speed produces a 4% increase 
in the fatal crash risk and a 3% increase in the serious crash risk. The death risk for pedestrians hit by car fronts rises 
rapidly (4.5 times from 50 km/h to 65 km/h). In car-to-car side impacts the fatality risk for car occupants is 85% at 65 
km/h. 
 
 
Allied Market research report (Jadhav, 2018) projects that the global autonomous vehicle market size would be 
$54.23B in 2019 and increase to $556.67B by 2026. The AV uses artificial intelligent (AI), light detection and ranging 
(LiDAR) and RADAR sensing technology.  Navigant Research report (Abuelsamid, 2019) ranked GM Cruise, Waymo 
and Ford Autonomous vehicle as the top three vehicle manufacturers leading the autonomous vehicle revolution. The 
research states that Waymo and GM Cruise are neck and neck in the race to secure autonomous-vehicle leadership, 
with scores of 86.7 and 86.6 points, respectively. The score is based on 10 factors: vision; go-to-market strategy; 
partners; production strategy; technology; sales, marketing and distribution; product capability; product quality and 
reliability; product portfolio; and staying power. 
 
 
Ford’s approach to developing Self-driving vehicles (Ford, 2018) report states that the growth of autonomous

about 95% of the time. As a result of this, as much as 30% of the prime real estate in the city centers are devoted to 
just parking alone. Autonomous vehicles are one of the solutions to address this concern. Ford Motor Company has

Abstract 
 
This study aims to investigate the protection and consistency during the physical human-robot collaboration to avoid 
serious injury. A low-cost torque sensor design is proposed to detect and measure the collision between the robot and 
human operator. The proposed perforated spoke type structure shifted the high-stresses location and modified the 
dispersal of the stresses. Moreover, the sensor response to the dynamic load and sensitivity is improved. The optimal 
parameters are selected based on the finite element analysis. A series of simulations were performed to validate the 
performance of the proposed torque sensor. The results show that the proposed design provides better performance 
compared to a non-perforated spoke type torque sensor. 
Keywords: Torque sensor, perforated spoke structure, human-robotic collaboration. 
 
1.0 Introduction 
With the advent of the Information Age, the robots have been utilized in multiple domains that demand collaboration 
between the robot and humans (Dimeas et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2011) wherein the dependability of the robot and 
safety should be ensured former. Therefore, an interaction between the human and a robot should be established in  a  
real-  time process (Haddadin et al.,2017). Numerous sensor-less based methods have been used to detect the robot’s 
collisions. By approximating the location of the robot, the collision can be detected from the controller information 
(Han et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the above method is not adequate for collision detection between the human and the 
robot in unfamiliar environments. 
 
Using the electric current of each rotary actuator or the energy of the robot (Lee et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2018), the 
collision can be approximated by utilizing the friction model and the dynamic model of the robot. The disadvantage 
of using the robot model for estimation is the inaccurate model (Baroon et al., 2015). Sensor-based techniques have 
been extensively studied for collision detection. Vision-based sensors can be utilized to avoid the impact before the 
collision (Mohammad et al., 2017). The disadvantages of the vision-based sensors are visionary issues as well as the 
manipulation cost are too high. The sensitive sensor can measure the impacts at multiple configurations of the robot 
(Kim et al., 2015). However, due to wiring complexity and its capability to suppress intervention is inferior.

6.0 Conclusion 
In this study, we proposed the design and analysis of a joint torque sensor for a safe human-robotic collaboration. The 
perforated spoke structure is presented to ensure fast collision detection to avoid severe damage. The strain gauges 
locations are shifted to high-stress region in the middle of the spoke to obtain a smooth voltage signal. The comparison 
among the most used materials is performed by the Finite Element Analysis technique using the SolidWorks. The 
aluminum alloy 7075 is selected among the tested materials for improved sensitivity, light-weight, and high strength 
capability. By topology optimization, the torque sensor thickness was reduced by 29.97% and the  ns rate was reduced 
by 18.72%.

Abstract 
 
Disaster such as hurricane, by nature, involves uncertainties in many facets, from the time of its occurrence to 
magnitude of its impacts. Due to its highly erratic movement, uncertainty during a storm event can quickly cascade. 
Failure to incorporate these uncertainties when forming any emergency response operations can significantly affect 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations. Understanding that the storm hazards such as strong winds, 
torrential rain, and storm surge can inflict significant damage on the transport network affecting population’s ability 
to move during/after the storm event, we proposed a cascading network failure model to accentuate this mobility issue. 
The model takes the scenario-level storm impacts generated by the data-driven probabilistic scenarios model from our 
previous work as inputs to predict uncertainties in the land transport network states during the storm event. We tested 
the model on Hurricane Irma case study to determine the mobility states of the Tampa Bay network over the 72-hour 
time horizon. The proposed model serves as a mean to predict uncertainty in the mobility states over the course of a 
storm event – a critical factor in forming effective and efficient response operation models.

1. Introduction  
Disaster management aims to lessen the impacts of disaster in terms of fatalities and the potential losses experienced 
by the society. Disaster such as hurricanes, by nature, involves uncertainties in many facets, from the time of its 
occurrence to magnitude of its impacts. These uncertainties can substantially influence the effectiveness and efficiency 
of any actions taken prior and/or during the course of the storm event. Note that, most disaster response actions operate 
on the road network which is greatly affected by the environment. Since weather is complex and dynamic, it is 
impractical to examine the impacts of every weather phenomenon (Pisano et al. 2001). Thus, only selected phenomena 
with significant immediate effects should be considered when determining the changes in the road transport.  
 
During a storm event, uncertainty is largest with respect to the consequences for wind strengths, precipitation patterns, 
and surge heights (US Climate Change Science Program 2008). Storm surge and intense rainfall affect roads through 
freshwater inundation and inland flooding whereas wind and rainfall affect vehicle maneuverability and driver 
capabilities. All of these affect the performance of the road transport system in forms of reduction in traffic speed and 
roadway capacity, and increase in travel time (Pisano et al. 2001). Disclosing changes in the network and its 
uncertainties due to these storm impacts could avoid a later loss of credibility if actual result proved to be significantly 
different from the predicted results. Hence, it is necessary to take justifiable predictions on the changes in the road 
network and mobility states into consideration when developing any response operations models.  
 
In this paper, we propose a new methodology to predict cascading transportation network failures during a storm 
event. The procedure takes the storm impacts forecasts to predict changes in the transport infrastructure while 
simultaneously determining the demand for population movement and potentially safe destinations. The resulting 
stochastic-dynamic network can then be utilized as basis to form appropriate response operations. The next section of 
this paper provides a brief methodology; followed by subsections documenting the model details and the 
corresponding algorithms. Applications of the proposed methodology to determine the mobility states of the Tampa

6. Conclusion and Future Works 
Road transport network is the backbone of moving people and goods in the United States and its operational activities 
are greatly affected by the weather conditions. During a storm event, the importance of road transport amplifies as it 
becomes primary means for evacuation and other response operations. Being able to predict the potential changes in 
the transport network due to the storm impact is of interest to decision makers to arrive at founded response operations. 
Since a large part of disaster response operations use transportation networks, which are greatly impacted by the 
weather conditions, a network failure model introduced in this research aims to predict the network states for a given 
set of weather forecasts over the course of a disaster event. We use the model to determine the mobility states of the 
Tampa Bay network over the time horizon during Hurricane Irma. It takes the spatial-temporal weather profiles from 
the simulation model to determine the mobility states of the Tampa Bay area network. The resulting stochastic 
dynamic network that explicitly represents uncertainties in the predictions of the network states during a storm event 
can then be utilized to derive the appropriate response operations. 
 
When predicting the mobility states, the model compares the node’s elevation with the storm surge height to determine 
whether evacuation should be issued for population residing in that node. Since choosing the appropriate elevation is 
important, it is possible to define the elevation of a node using the center of population distribution approach as

current impacts model assumes that buildings, structures, and storm drainage comply with the current building code. 
Yet, per demographic data, vast majority of the buildings and structures are built in much earlier years. Upon 
comparing the building codes which are generated every four years, it was found that the wind load requirement can 
vary significantly during these years. Hence, it may be better to utilize the year structure built in order to better 
represent the impacts on building structures.

Preparing a Global Workforce with a Local Internship Program 
 
This work features an innovative internship program that is being developed in the Department of Industrial and 
Systems Engineering (ISE) at Virginia Tech through a collaboration with the Office of Vice Provost for Learning 
Systems Innovation and Effectiveness (LSIE), Virginia Tech. The internship program is designed to provide 
undergraduates in ISE with critical workforce skills prior to graduation through partnerships with local manufacturing 
employers. Opportunities to participate in paid internships that provide opportunities to apply classroom concepts to 
real-world scenarios related to Industry 4.0 challenges are critically important in the rural setting of this American 
research focused university. ISE undergraduates at Virginia Tech are traditionally encouraged to pursue internship 
opportunities prior to graduation so they can take concepts covered in courses such as cyber-physical systems, Internet 
of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and cognitive computing and apply them to current challenges faced in 
manufacturing environments. A full course schedule during the academic year requires that students look to the 
summer to secure these experiential learning opportunities or ‘stop out’ during a fall or spring semester if they want 
to pursue a cooperative learning experience (co-op). Utilizing the flexibility of summer or relying on co-op experiences 
can slow students time to degree. This is true especially given the rural setting of Virginia Tech as students have 
traditionally looked to relocate to engage in these experiences. The innovative internship experience that this session 
describes highlights partnerships that have been developed with local rural manufacturing focused industries. The paid 
internships were funded in partnership with local employers and a regional economic development organization. 
Strategic efforts ensure that the students are exposed to critical Industry 4.0 concepts in real world settings. The paid 
internships with local employers are designed with flexibility in mind. This allows ISE students to augment their 
classroom learning while they are enrolled in traditional fall/spring courses or during the summer while still making 
progress towards degree. This work will present the overall program design, the related assessment and evaluation 
work on program efficacy, and the findings from assessments conducted related to student development as it relates 
to skills needed for a global engineering workforce. Engineering educators can use the program design and related 
findings to consider how experiential learning opportunities can be used to adapt and refine engineering curriculum 
to create a workforce ready to take on Industry 4.0 challenges as they pertain to manufacturing.

Abstract  
 
This study examines the main Industry 4.0 technologies that, according to the literature, might reinforce the 
capacity of lean manufacturing (LM) to improve plant performance. Moving away from the existing studies 
that typically handle this question at a high level, we opted for a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis 
(fsQCA), which enables multiple antecedents and their combinations to be identified to determine the 
outcome. Necessary data were obtained from a multisector sample of 568 manufacturing plants (NACE 
codes 15–37) from six European countries. The results support the argument that different causal paths 
among LM and Industry 4.0 improve plant performance; however, contrary to the initial expectations, the 
findings revealed that Industry 4.0 technologies (specifically digital technologies and additive 
manufacturing) seem to be, by themselves, sufficient conditions that can improve the results. In fact, in 
contrast to conventional lean wisdom, the findings suggest that in 4.0 technology-intensive shop floors, 
certain lean practices, those conceived for high volume-low variety (HVLV) manufacturing systems, might 
be counterproductive.

Abstract 
 
Measurement and management of consumer relationships with brands are critical issue that marketers have 
focused on for years. The quality of the relationship between the consumer and brand affects behavioral 
intention in favor of the brand. This research aims to reveal the effect of consumer-brand relationship 
quality (BRQ) on positive word-of-mouth (WoM) intention. The BRQ components were applied on the 
sample of private university students in Istanbul, Turkey. The questionnaire form with 5-point Likert scale 
was distributed and 199 valid surveys were obtained. Cronbach's Alfa was examined to internal consistency 
of the scales, and exploratory factor analysis was conducted to assess constructive validity. Multiple 
regression analysis resulted in love/passion, commitment, and self-connection, which are the dimensions 
of BRQ, have a positive WoM intention. On the other hand, the intimacy factor has no significant effect.

1. Introduction 
The increasing number of businesses today has intensified the competition and increased the number of brands to keep 
a place in the consumer mind. Increasing competition and the number of brands also increased the marketing mix 
activities. This situation makes it difficult for brands to gain control over the consumer. The intensely competitive 
environment in the market has required brands that can establish positive and close relationships with consumers. For 
this reason, how the consumer-brand relationship can be established is one of the activities that have a strategic role 
for businesses. 
 
As of 2019, it is estimated that the number of internet users worldwide is 4.5 billion and the internet penetration rate 
is 58.8% (Internet World Stats, 2019). In a market environment where digitalization is intense, consumers can now 
access the information they want with a few clicks. It enables positive or negative customer experiences to be 
transferred from offline to online and leads to millions of people in a short time. 
 
The form of communication that allows consumers to influence other consumers by sharing their purchasing and using 
experiences around and online, is called the word of mouth (WoM). In offline environments, the fact that consumers 
recommend businesses, brands or products can positively affect their intention to purchase. There is a positive 
correlation between WoM communication on the online platform and sales (Rosario et al., 2016). Therefore, WoM is 
a strategic tool for brands to survive in the long term.

For this reason, brands that can develop close relationships with the consumer can stand out in the competition and 
maintain their presence in the market by providing a long-term profit. 
 
BRQ, which covers the cognitive, emotional and behavioral relationship that the consumer has established with the 
brand, affects positive WoM. Brands that can establish sustainable relationships with their real and potential customers 
will have the opportunity to promote free of charge thanks to WoM communication. Thus, BRQ will play an important 
role in reducing the perceived risk to the brand. 
 
As with any study, this research also has some limitations. Firstly, the application of the study is only on students 
studying at the foundation university. The broader and homogeneous demographic profile of the participants will 
provide access to different research findings. Second, researching the framework of clothing products is another 
constraint. It is recommended to apply the research model in different product categories or service types. It is possible 
to access different findings from the literature by including different mediator or moderator variables in the research 
model. In future studies, the role of different variables such as personality, distribution channels, technology 
acceptance in the effect of BRQ on behavioral intention can be examined.

Abstract 
 
This paper proposes an approach to predict the operational performance of a port terminal using the combination of 
Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA and Artificial Neural Networks forecasting models. The empirical research was 
performed using data from the unloading operation of iron ore from the Carajás mine (Brazil), which is the largest 
open pit iron mine in the world. The results showed that the proposed combined forecasting approach generates better 
predictions than the univariates models when compared to other possible methods. The proposed approach can be 
applied to other complex decision problems that need to predict operational performance with high accuracy in the 
industrial and logistic context.

1. Introduction 
 
Short-term decisions play an important role in the organizational context, especially in planning operations and 
resource allocation in productive processes (Vieira, Kück, Frazzon, and Freitag, 2017; Rashed, Meersman, Voorde, 
and Vanelslander, 2017; Choi, Wallace, and Wang, 2018; Leusin, Kück, Frazzon, and Freitag, 2018). In this context, 
forecasting techniques are presented with the aim of solving several problems involving risks, since they allow the 
generation of subsidies that assist decision makers in formulating strategies in productive processes (Wang and Chang, 
2010; Bansal and Dyer, 2013; Amornpetchkul, Duenyas, and Şahin, 2015; Isasi, Frazzon, and Uriona, 2015; Boone, 
Ganeshan, Hicks, and Sanders, 2018). In general, forecasting in the organizational context uses quantitative methods, 
based on the existence of historical data records. Among the quantitative models for forecasting, the time series models 
stand out (Montgomery, Jennings, and Kulahci, 2015; Agostino, Silva, Veiga and Sousa, 2020). 
In this scenario, port terminals are characterized as dynamic environments, depending on tools for planning and control 
of operations, aiming at minimizing efforts and increasing productivity (Gómez, Camarero, and Molina, 2016; 
Goedhals-Gerber, 2016; Agostino, Sousa, Frota, Daher, and Souza, 2019; Choi, Lee, Leung, Pinedo, and Briskorn, 
2012). Among the works found in the literature, Fung (2001) developed a structured model of error corrections to 
predict the transfer rate of containers at the port terminals of Hong Kong. Vlahogianni, Karlaftis, and Golias (2005) 
used a nonlinear approach with application of artificial neural network (ANN) models for short-term prediction of 
flow and occupation of transport. Schulze and Prinz (2009) analyzed container movement at German ports using 
SARIMA models and Holt-Winters model, finding superior results for the adjusted SARIMA model. Pang and Gebka 
(2016) used the Holt-Winters models, ARIMA seasonal models and the Vectors Error Correction (VEC) model to

63","considered allowed to conclude that models in the short term showed itself as accurate forecasters of the indicators. 
In addition, the proposed approach can be replicated in other studies involving complex decision problems that need 
to predict the behavior of variables with high precision. As a guide for future work, it is suggested the use of 
multivariate models to predict performance indicators, allowing the incorporation of the interrelation between 
variables such as vector autoregressive modeling and vectors error correction. Another important aspect to be 
investigated is the applicability of the forecast combination through other combination methods in different contexts 
and different forecast horizons.
