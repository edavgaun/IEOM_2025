Abstract 
This research focuses on a bus industry in the State of Mexico, sustainability is essential to preserve our planet; a 
Circular economy is a transformative economy proposal that conserves and improves natural capital, optimizes the 
use of resources, and minimizes the risks of the system by managing a finite amount of existence and renewable 
flows. Currently, the population is suffering the aftermath of COVID-19, such as lung scars, chronic inflammatory 
processes, and a decrease in the level of oxygen saturation in the blood until; now it continues to evolve in different 
strains. The objective of this research is to develop a post-COVID-19 environmental strategy based on the circular 
economy considering sustainable plastic manufacturing in the auto parts sector to include bioplastics as raw material 
in the bus industry in the State of Mexico. To achieve this objective, it was carried out in 2 phases: situational 
analysis and determination-deployment of the strategy. The method used in research is deductive and applicative 
research. The main finding is identifying sustainable plastic materials such as bio-based PET (Polyethylene 
Terephthalate), soy foams, natural fibers such as rice husks, and coconut reinforcement used for molding plastic 
parts. In conclusion, the strategy presents the value that sustainability has for the market and customers, the 
environmental benefits of bioplastics, and a potential decrease in the cost of manufacturing auto parts, granting a 
greater appreciation of the brand image and the industry's environmental responsibility.

Abstract 
The reduction of drag force is a complex and intricate challenge for the automotive manufacturing industry, as it has 
a direct impact on the overall performance of vehicles. Reducing drag force on a car enhances its ability to 
efficiently disperse air separation, resulting in reduced impediment and increased maximum velocity. The air 
resistance, which acts as a hindrance to the vehicle's movement, is considered a crucial element for enhancing both 
car performance and safety. Minimising air resistance contributes to the enhancement of the vehicle's ability to retain 
superior traction and stability. Aerodynamic profiling is used in this study to illuminate the impact of the vehicle's 
shape and surface representation on its behaviour. Results, reduce the drag force, and enhance the performance of 
the car. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of a car by using 
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Additionally, the aim of this paper is to review and analyse relevant 
prior research in this field.

1. Introduction
The aerodynamics of automobiles focus on the airflow patterns surrounding a vehicle and analyse these patterns to 
understand overall performance, mainly the effect of lift and drag forces. The primary objectives of the study of 
vehicle aerodynamics are to minimise the air resistance or drag force effect on the movement of the vehicle and 
enhance stability during high-speed operation. Aerodynamics is also used to minimise air flow turbulence for 
optimization of the cooling system and the reduction of wind noise. These endeavours ultimately contribute to a 
heightened level of comfort for the driver (Hucho & Sovran, 1993). Various categories of racing vehicles may also 
use difficult techniques to minimise downward force, therefore enhancing adhesion and, consequently, improving 
surrounding abilities. The recognition of the standard aerodynamic characteristics of a vehicle design is becoming 
more widely acknowledged. The continuous endeavour to enhance fuel efficiency necessitates a comprehensive 
examination of vehicle drag, while the importance placed on vehicle handling underscores the imperative of 
acquiring a profound comprehension of aerodynamics. It is important to highlight that aerodynamic drag constitutes 
more than 50% of the overall resistance to movement when the speed surpasses 32 m/s, and it becomes the 
predominant factor after 45 m/s (Sudin et al. 2014).

These analysis shows a slight similar results according to the review papers have represented. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the preceding discourse, it can be deduced that the utilisation of software-based computational fluid 
dynamics analysis serves as a supplementary instrument for quantifying aerodynamic forces. Computational Fluid 
Dynamics (CFD) is widely recognised as a rapid and precise method for quantifying aerodynamic forces. It is 
imperative to prioritise the exploration and implementation of diverse technological advancements aimed at 
mitigating aerodynamic forces, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the overall aerodynamic efficiency of 
automobiles. The fetched out data from the review papers and the analysis represents the accuracy of the researches. 
The addition of certain equipment to the car can effectively reduce the drag and lift force, thereby enhancing its 
overall performance.

Abstract 
The article applies genetic algorithms as a tool of artificial intelligence that provides optimal solutions to the problem 
of vehicle routing in the distribution chain by transport companies. The main problem in the food sector is transporting 
perishable goods with low life expectancy. The methodology used for the present work was a systematic literature 
review focused on applying genetic algorithms in transport companies. To achieve this goal, a massive search was 
made in Scopus, Web of Science, and Proquest databases. A total of 60 articles were compiled for this document. For 
the study of the extracted articles, they were categorized into three factors: total costs in distribution, profitability, and 
delivery times. For the findings section, the use of Vosviewer software was used. The use of this software allowed us 
to demonstrate that genetic algorithms would have a positive influence on each of the factors mentioned.

1. Introduction
This article focuses on analyzing and applying the algorithm in supply chain management. Likewise, it has become 
an indispensable resource for the optimization of distribution routes to the final customer, as a consequence of which 
the increase in profitability in transport companies has been highlighted, especially in the food sector, in recent years. 
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO 2021), they highlight ""Solutions to 
stop food loss and waste include: good data to know where in the value chain the main food loss and waste hotspots; 
apply innovation, for example, e-commerce platforms for merchandising or mobile shrink-wrap food processing 
systems; government incentives to strengthen private sector action against food loss and waste and collaboration in 
supply chains; investments in training, technology, and innovation, even for small producers.” 
Distribution is directly linked to the transportation sector, which assumes an important role in the flow of products 
from a distributor supply chain. But activities such as the distribution of perishable foods are often very limited by the 
life expectancy of the products and the possibility that they are affected on the way to the final customer. This is due 
to the distance between the distributor and the last customer, which cause high transportation costs and risk to the 
quality of the distributed merchandise, especially when transporting perishable products (Haerani et al. 2017). This is 
how the efficiency of distribution networks in a logistics system will determine the speed of response to rapid changes 
in market demands in this era of economic globalization, worldwide supply, and mass customization (Wang & Lu 
2009). The vehicle routing problem (VRP) must be addressed to achieve this efficiency. Tasan and Gen (2012) 
describe delivering goods to customers with known demands through vehicle routes that begin and end in the deposit 
with a minimum cost. For this (Ting & Liao 2013; Derbel et al. 2012) agree that the objective of efficiency should be 
focused on finding the shortest route and providing an efficient service in such a way that the requirement of each 
client can be satisfied. It is on time and within the capacity and travel time of the vehicles. The approach to obtaining 
the best approximate solution is essential for efficiency in logistics activity, environmental conservation, and energy 
savings (Okude & Taniguchi 2014). 
The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is, mathematically, a combinatorial optimization problem (Wang & Lu 2009). 
The problem is complex and highly restricted, as it involves many different and interconnected decisions (service

Abstract 
Efficient and effective warehouse management is one of the most important issues in any supply chain. Order picking, 
which occurs in a warehouse or distribution center (DC), is the most costly and labor-intensive operation. As a result, 
many researchers have focused on optimizing this process and finding near-optimal solutions. This study presents a 
heuristic solution approach to address the order batching and assignment problems in a warehouse with multiple 
pickers and a central depot. In the proposed method, order batching problem is solved using the proximity batching 
approach. Additionally, a one-way S-shape routing strategy is implemented, as it is easy for order pickers to follow 
and reduces congestion in the aisles. In the literature, the majority of studies assume S-shape routing strategy in their 
solution approach. When assigning batches to pickers, workload balance among pickers is also taken into 
consideration. The proposed solution approach is applied to both a 6 aisle and 8-aisle warehouse layout. The 
performance of proposed solution approach is compared with First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) batching method and 
left-most depot location. The results indicate that constructing a central depot can slightly decrease the order picking 
distance. However, the followed batching strategy has a much greater impact on order picking performance when 
compared to the depot location. The proximity batching strategy can significantly reduce the order picking distance 
when compared to the FCFS batching approach. Furthermore, pairwise comparisons demonstrate that a central depot 
location with a proximity batching strategy has the most positive effect on increasing order picking performance.

1. Introduction
Managing warehouse operations in an efficient way is very significant issue for production companies, DCs, and e-
commerce retailers. By doing this, any firm can decrease their operation costs by eliminating unnecessary operations 
and increase customer satisfaction. The most basic and comprehensive warehouse management process that affects 
other warehouse operations is the order picking process. Order picking can be defined as retrieving the necessary 
items requested by customers from their storage locations (Chan and Chan 2011). This extensive process includes 
other interactive warehouse operations that have a significant impact on each other’s performance such as order 
batching, routing, assignment, and picker scheduling. In other words, following a certain strategy in one of this process 
can impact the performance of the other operation. Therefore, in recent years researchers have started to handle these 
interrelated operations in a holistic way (Cheng et al. 2015), (Scholz et al. 2017), (Valle et al. 2017), (Menéndez et al. 
2017), (Zhang et al. 2017), (Van Gils et al. 2019), (Briant et. al. 2020), (Cano et al. 2022).
It will be suitable to explain each warehouse processes with single sentences. Order batching involves grouping 
customer orders into comprehensive batches to be collected in a single picking tour, aiming to reduce the total order

and PRO_L produces much more difference in order picking distance. This means that choosing the proper order 
batching method for order picking is much more important parameter than depot location parameter.

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
This study investigates the impact of depot location on order picking performance when employing a selected batching 
method with multiple pickers in 6-aisle and 8-aisle warehouses. Randomly generated order categories are used, with 
10 experiments conducted for each category. The results of these experiments indicate that the selected batching 
method has a significant effect on decreasing order picking distance when compared different depot locations. In other 
words, batching methods significantly affect order picking performance. But the performance can also be increased a 
little by constructing central depot instead of left-most depot.  
 
As future research directions, the study suggests exploring the effects of storage strategies in conjunction with depot 
location and batching approaches, considering multiple pickers. Furthermore, investigating different routing 
strategies, such as largest gap or midpoint, in these future studies could be beneficial. Additionally, the development 
of constructive heuristics to achieve a more balanced workload among order pickers is worth exploring.

Abstract 
The uniqueness of the present idea is to utilize the “Combination of SAGARSONA and 
MYCORRHIZA” (de novo thinking product) for enhancing the productivity of paddy. The recent 
challenge in agriculture is how to regenerate and rejuvenate soils and stabilize production in the 
context of high chemical dependent production, and that will enable us to meet the goals of 
sustainable agriculture and provide safe and nutritious food security for all, especially the poor. 
SAGARSONA is an ideal organic manure prepared with locally available ingredients has been 
proved to be efficient at per with that of chemical fertilizers. While, the mutualistic associations 
between Mycorrhiza (potent pesticide) and agriculturally important crops have shown the potential 
to increase crop productivity, thereby playing a key role in the functioning and sustainability of 
agro-ecosystem. The ultimate goal is to achieve sustainability by enabling local SHG members 
along the NGO to support themselves financially in innovative ways instead of relying solely on 
grants and donations. Essential of the success of social enterprise is an effective business model.

Abstract 
Covid-19 pandemic brought several changes in the working conditions of employees, who had to adapt to new work 
modalities known as home office. The objective of this study was to identify the correlation between the physical and 
psychosocial ergonomic conditions of the home office environment of workers belonging to the service sector in Peru 
and the effects of these conditions on their job satisfaction. For this purpose, a quasi-experimental methodology was 
designed with a mixed approach and a correlational scope, the ergonomic evaluation of the LEST method and a job 
satisfaction questionnaire were used on a sample of 97 employees in the service sector in Peru. After performing the 
Pearson correlation using SPSS software, the hypothesis is rejected and, therefore, the alternative hypothesis is 
accepted, which confirms the existence of a correlation between the variables described before. An inverse and 
statistically significant correlation was found between the mental workload dimension of the LEST method and job 
satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Peru has been the country most affected in the world by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of number of deaths as a 
percentage of the population (Borrell J. 2021). Due to the global health crisis, how people work all around the world 
changed drastically, with remote work, specifically the home office, becoming a prevailing mode of employment 
across various industries. This transition was marked by both opportunity and challenge, as the laboring classes are 
the principally infected and affected by the new coronavirus, companies scrambled to adjust to a new way of working 
(Lust J. 2021). A job is a significant part of people's lives, shaping both their lifestyle and social connections. As a 
result, it is crucial for every organization to maintain a satisfied and fulfilled workforce (Inayat, W. & Jahanzeb, M., 
2021). That is why this transformation raised fundamental questions about the ergonomic conditions of home offices 
and their impact on the job satisfaction of employees, particularly those in the service sector. 
This research explores the complex connection between the physical and psychosocial ergonomic conditions of the 
home office and the job satisfaction of employees in Peru's service sector. It explores how these ergonomic factors 
contribute to the overall well-being and contentment of employees in a rapidly evolving work environment. To 
navigate this multifaceted inquiry, the study is anchored in a series of key research questions: 
51","Proceedings of the 3rd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

increase in tasks, not only in the work environment but also in the personal and family environment, caused 
individuals to have a considerable mental workload during their work in the home office modality (Amado, 
B., et al., 2020). In order to check how the mental workload triggered by the home office affects the job 
satisfaction of employees in the service sector, the correlation between the mental workload dimension, 
which was rated as the least satisfactory in the LEST Method, and the total rating obtained in job satisfaction 
was carried out. A relationship of -0.232 with a p-value of 0.22 was reached, which leads to the conclusion 
that there is a significant inverse correlation between the two. This last correlation could be justified on the 
basis of arguments about work psychology, which consider the effects of workload in terms of stress, mental 
and emotional health, social interaction, among others. 
 
5.2 Validation 
The finding of the present research is the inverse and statistically significant correlation between the job satisfaction 
variable and ergonomic conditions in the home office. Similar studies have not been found because this work modality 
is recent and there are still no articles about it. In this way, the importance of ergonomic conditions in the workspace 
is demonstrated, within the framework of a new work context that has arisen as a result of the pandemic. To expand 
this research, a more specific approach could be made, by studying the most covid affected sectors.  
The results obtained in the sample of 97 employees in the service sector in Peru, show that an average of 23% of 
respondents reported having average discomfort in the mental workload dimension, which compares with the study 
conducted in Spain by the National Institute of Safety and Hygiene at Work (INSHT). The latter establishes that 22.5% 
of employees consider that work has a considerable effect on their health, and 28% of these indicate stress as the 
determining cause and the second health problem at work (Aboitiz, X. 2008). 
This research has used the LEST method that is applied in face-to-face work which is originally designed for work 
where there is a physical and repetitive effort involved in face-to-face work... a specific tool could be developed. 
Based on the study. 
 
Finally, the LEST method questionnaire was used, but not in the home office. For this reason, a specific tool could be 
developed to evaluate the ergonomic conditions of the home office, since some companies will remain in this new 
modality. This is evidenced in a study by Adobe Forrester, which shows that 39% of companies state that they will 
adopt telework permanently. Likewise, the ILO states that the home office will not end with the end of the pandemic, 
as it will be part of the new normal in the future along with other digitalization tools (Forbes Staff, 2021). 
 
6. Conclusion  
After performing the Pearson correlation between the results obtained in the evaluation of the LEST Method and the 
job satisfaction survey, it is concluded that there is a correlation between the physical and psychosocial ergonomic 
conditions of the home office and the job satisfaction of employees in the service sector in Peru. 
 
Finally, mental workload is the dimension of the LEST method that has the most significant correlation with job 
satisfaction, and since it is inverse, it indicates that the greater the mental workload, the lower the job satisfaction of 
the worker in the home office.

Abstract 
The construction sector is an important driver of the economy and a generator of employment, but it has high 
occupational accident rates each year. In Peru, small construction companies lack an occupational health and safety 
management system, which is reflected in the number of accidents reported each year, which is as high as 3,000. 
Therefore, it is important to look after the welfare of the most valuable asset of each company: the worker. This paper 
presents a proposal for a safety model based on Lean tools: 5S and TPM, and work standardization to reduce the 
accident rate in a Peruvian construction SME. The proposed model is divided into three components that represent the 
application of each of the tools. It also consists of four phases and a duration of two months divided into four fortnights. 
Finally, the results obtained were favorable, reducing the accident rate by 75% with respect to the initial situation.

1. Introduction
At a global level, ""the construction sector is a natural dynamizer of the economy, since it makes it possible to close 
existing infrastructure gaps throughout [a] country, and thus raise the productivity of people and their living standards"" 
(ComexPerú 2022). In Peru, “the construction sector is very important for the economy [due to] its relationship with 
productive activities in other industries. It is a direct [and] important source of employment and brings together 
important infrastructure projects” (ComexPerú  2022). The construction sector ended 2022 with a growth of 3% 
compared to the previous year (-8.9%), this due to the increase in the progress of public works (15.2%) and a lower 
reduction in cement consumption (-6.7%). with respect to the estimate (CAPECO 2023). Likewise, the companies in 
the sector interviewed indicated that their levels of operation increased by 1.7%, although infrastructure builders 
experienced a contraction of 3.3% (CAPECO 2023). Likewise, according to data obtained by the Ministry of Labor 
and Employment Promotion, in Peru, more than 3,000 accidents occur per year in the construction sector, which shows 
a high accident rate in companies in the sector. 
Carrillo Ayala (2020) explains based on his study that among the main causes are ""exposure to long working hours, 
deficiencies in training and training programs in safety and health at work, non-use of the elements of personal 
protection and non-compliance with safety guidelines” (p.70). Some case studies in Peru are summarized below. In 
Lima, a safety model based on Lean Construction and Behavior-Based Safety was developed to reduce the number of 
accidents and implement a safety culture within a company in the construction sector through the analysis of indicators 
and as a result, the reduction of the accident rate of 35.37%. (González & Morocho 2022). In Arequipa, a study was 
carried out with the objective of reducing the accident rate of a local construction company, through the 
implementation of the occupational health and safety plan based on the G.050 standard, as a result the frequency rate 
decreased by 529.25 to 366.25 and the severity index from 719.04 to 405.49, reducing the accident rate by 23.37% 
(Quispe 2021).

Finally, work standardization was implemented, as it allows workers to perform a task in the fastest and most effective 
way. The following steps were followed for the implementation of this methodology: 
1. A group was created in charge of breaking down the different activities into small steps for their subsequent 
analysis. 
2. The optimal sequence in each activity was determined and the most efficient methods of carrying it out were 
defined. 
3. Times were established in each step to guarantee good performance and work efficiency 
4. These standards were recorded in documents accessible to all personnel within the facility. 
5. Finally, a weekly inspection was carried out to guarantee compliance with the standards and identify opportunities 
for improvement. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Due to the implementation of the proposed model in which the three methodologies are applied: 5s, TPM and work 
standardization, a reduction in the accident rate from 5.56 to 1.39 was obtained, exceeding the expected value; These 
results were significant for the analysis, since with this the correct functioning of the model could be verified. In 
addition, it managed to improve 100% in the correct use of PPEs and standardized activities, which allows the worker 
to feel safe, motivated and committed to their work. In addition, accident prevention reduces time lost due to sick 
leave, avoids delays in projects, prevents damage to company assets and avoids interruptions within work. 
 
Safety and health at work is a relevant issue within a construction company due to the need to protect workers and 
guarantee their well-being. The implementation of this type of safety model can help take appropriate safety measures 
and form occupational risk prevention to reduce the accident rate, protecting not only the physical and mental integrity 
of employees, but also reducing the costs associated with accidents. such as medical expenses and compensation for 
work disabilities.

Abstract 
The growing boom of global gastronomy has been manifested in Lima with a significant increase in Japanese 
restaurants. Despite this growth, customer satisfaction, a key factor for success, presents challenges. In the particular 
case of a restaurant, the problem lies in a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -2%, considerably lower than the industry 
average (60%). This discrepancy, mainly motivated by the quality of the food, poses the challenge of raising the NPS 
to the 60% standard. To address this challenge, a two-pronged approach is proposed: standardized work and supplier 
management. The first ensures consistent processes that guarantee quality consistency, while the second ensures the 
excellence of the ingredients used. The validation of this approach was carried out through a pilot test, based on 
surveys of 385 customers. The implementation of the model yielded significant improvements: an increase in NPS to 
62.5%, thus surpassing the industry average. Additionally, the restaurant achieved a Customer Satisfaction Score of 
75% for food quality and 81% for waiting time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and its 
techniques, showcasing its ability to solve the identified problem and improve customer satisfaction. 
Keywords 
Standardized work, Supplier management, Restaurant, Net Promoter Score, Customer satisfaction. 
1. Introduction
Throughout the years, the gastronomy industry has experienced constant growth, and Lima, Peru, has not been an 
exception (INEI 2022). In this context, Japanese restaurants have increased their presence in the city, with customer 
satisfaction being a key factor for the success and profitability of these businesses (Central Reserve Bank of Peru 
2020). The problem identified in this study is an NPS (Net Promoter Score) lower than 60% in a Japanese restaurant 
in Lima, indicating significant customer dissatisfaction (Upson 2020; Reichheld 2003). This situation arises in a 
contextual framework where Peruvian cuisine is recognized globally and regionally, creating high expectations for 
quality and service (INEI 2010). 
The importance of addressing customer dissatisfaction lies in its direct impact on customer loyalty and the profitability 
of gastronomic businesses (Ochoa 2018; Gestión 2019). Despite the industry's efforts, such as implementing customer 
service technologies like robots in restaurants (Jain et al., 2023), and planning material requirements under uncertain 
delivery times (Diaz et al. 2016), there are still differences in local realities that require specific solutions. Additionally, 
previous studies have demonstrated the significance of supplier selection and supply chain management in customer 
satisfaction (Sarache Castro et al. 2009; Lau et al. 2016). 
The motivation for this research stems from the need to address the issue of NPS below 60% in a Japanese restaurant 
in Lima, providing a significant contribution to the local industry. The proposal is based on a comprehensive analysis 
of the factors influencing customer satisfaction and the implementation of strategies and improvements focused on

As for the wings, the pilot test was conducted over two days: on the first day, the wings were prepared using the 
current method, and on the second day, they were prepared using the new method. The results were compared, and 
each customer was asked to fill out a survey regarding the wings when they requested the bill. 
Finally, the results of the surveys conducted during the pilot test were analyzed. A total of 20 people were surveyed 
each day. 
 
5.4 Validation 
For this case study, the validation of the proposal's implementation will be carried out through a pilot test. This method 
was chosen because the objective of the improvements is to enhance and maintain the quality of the food, which can 
only be verified through its consumption. 
During the pilot test, customers will be provided with surveys after finishing their meals to evaluate, analyze, and 
compare the results. 
 
To determine the optimal sample size for the pilot test, the formula for sample size for an infinite population was used. 
The maximum acceptable estimation error (""e"") was set at 5%, and a confidence level of 95% was considered 
(Z=1.96), assuming a data heterogeneity of 50% (p and q = 0.5). This calculation yielded a result of 385 individuals 
required for the sample. However, due to limitations such as budget constraints, daily customer count, time, space, 
and company policies, a much smaller sample size will be used for the pilot test. Later, this smaller sample will be 
extrapolated to obtain the desired 385-person sample size. 
 
6. Conclusion 
According to the results obtained in the pilot test, it can be concluded that with the tools used, the NPS was increased 
to 62.5%, slightly above the industry standard of 60%. This means that customers were satisfied and would return, in 
addition to recommending the restaurant to others, resulting in an increase in new customers. Therefore, it is 
recommended that the restaurant prepares to meet higher demand. 
 
Another problem that was solved is the quality of the food, which was the main complaint of customers. This is 
reflected in the food CSAT, which was 53% before the implementation of the improvement, but increased to 75% 
after the improvement, meaning that 3 out of 4 customers are satisfied with the quality of the food. 
On the other hand, waiting time is one of the main issues that customers complained about, with 62% of customers 
being satisfied with it. Although the waiting times have not decreased, now 80% of customers are satisfied with the 
waiting time because they don't mind waiting a little longer in exchange for a good-quality product. 
It is important to note that this study was focused solely on the quality of the food, as there are other factors such as 
customer service and ambiance that influence customers' decisions. 
Finally, it is recommended to continue with surveys to gather more feedback and obtain even more precise data, as 
the pilot test had its limitations. Additionally, it is recommended to create a Best Practices Manual (BPM) to ensure 
the preservation of the implemented improvements and for future employees.

Abstract 
Stockouts occur when an entity runs out of inventory or when the customer cannot find the product at the 
point of sale. There is a lot of research that focuses on solving stockout problems in different industries; 
however, the amount of such research is very limited with respect to SMEs in the pharmaceutical sector. 
The purpose of this study was to analyze the main reasons for the existence of inventory problems in 
pharmaceutical SMEs and to develop a model to reduce them. The study unit was an SME dedicated to the 
commercialization of retail pharmaceutical products, which had an inventory availability of 76.5%, well 
below the industry average of 93%. Tools based on Lean Healthcare (Kraljic Matrix), EOQ and ABC-VED 
were used to reduce stockouts as the racks available at the SME were repositioned to provide the best 
distribution of medications in the pharmacy. In order to have better control of the available medications. 
As a result, inventory availability increased to 87.7%, the rate of unsatisfied orders decreased by 5.6% and 
the rate of unsatisfied orders decreased by 11.7%, thus increasing the probability of benefits for the entity 
and the customer. This encourages to implement the tools in similar cases to improve inventory availability 
in the pharmaceutical industry, especially in SMEs.

1. Introduction
Currently, the pharmaceutical industry is an industrial and business sector dedicated to research, 
development, production and marketing of medicines for the treatment and prevention of diseases, and 
health care in general (BDO Argentina 2013). In recent years, it has proven to be the least sensitive to the 
impact of the pandemic, due to the priority given to personal protection and hygiene, i.e., during the 
pandemic, several sectors were paused and others did not continue, but this sector continued working to 
improve the health and quality of people by promoting research, innovation and employment (Tetelboin, 
C. 2021). It generates jobs and economic contributions to the national GDP. This industry participated of
1.4% GDP of 2018, reflected in 918 million soles (Fiestas L. 2018). In the same year, the industry employed
approximately 23 thousand workers on payroll directly and at the same time 140 thousand workers
indirectly (Fiestas L. 2018). The value in sales that the industry currently exerts is very large, in the last
year the market size was 4 billion soles (Euromonitor International, n.d.).
Globally, there are several types of problems that arise in this pharmaceutical sector, but if we focus on 
drug supply problems, it is important to emphasize that different definitions are used to define them, among 
them are drug shortages. This occurs when ""supply does not meet demand"", taking into account the 
economic concept angle. However, if we focus on the main recurring problems in the pharmaceutical sector, 
they are drug shortages and supply interruptions. The first, happens when the supply of medicines does not 
meet the demand at the level of consumers/patients), the second happens when the supply of medicines 
fails to meet the demand at the level of pharmacies and wholesalers (Elfii de Weerdt et al. 2017).

In these three graphs, which show how the indicators have evolved over the weeks that the Pilot has been 
running, we can see that the results tend to get better as time goes by. We believe that the results obtained 
in the future will not be as volatile as they are now, since there will be a stabilization of the results that will 
be managed over time. 
6. Conclusions 
The tools used helped to meet the objectives of improving the initial statistics, even if market standards 
could not be reached during the pilot test, it is evident that they were part of the positive change obtained 
in the previous statistics. 
 
Commitments to implement new strategies that are agents of change should be adopted by all managers 
and operators of the company, in this way better results are obtained. 
 
It is considered important to have access to critical information of the company to be studied, regardless of 
its complexity, this must be understood in order to select the main needs for improvement.

Abstract 
Companies have been affected by the inflation caused by the country's changing commercial and geopolitical 
environment. Nevertheless, there has been significant growth in the volume of purchases from them. In this case study, 
the company buys from manufacturers and distributes to wholesalers and retailers. In Peru, the main channels through 
which mass consumer products are purchased are supermarkets, bodegas, and markets. It has been identified that one 
of the areas with the greatest pain point is the delivery of perfect orders, which generates losses for the companies. 
The purpose of this research is to reduce the number of returned orders through 5S tools, process standardization and 
using the TQM methodology. In addition, to validate this model, the Arena software will be used to simulate the 
process from picking until the products are delivered to the customer, in which the results will show the decrease of 
returned orders from 7% to 5.32%.

1. Introduction
Currently, mass consumption companies face a changing commercial and geopolitical environment, where the 
economy experiences inflation and a risk of recession (Handrinos et al. 2023). This leads to increased costs and that 
several companies have been affected by the decrease in their gross margin. Mass consumption in Peru, despite the 
price increase, had a growth of 1.7% in volume and 11% in value, comparing the second quarter of 2022 with the year 
2019, since it was the last year before the pandemic (Luna 2022). Likewise, in the fourth quarter of last year, the gross 
domestic product grew by 2.5% in the trade activity, which was largely due to the positive performance of the 
wholesale and retail trade subsector (INEI 2022). The study company is a distributor of products in the mass 
consumption sector, which is responsible for purchasing products directly from manufacturers and sells them to its 
customers. In the United States, wholesale distributors have about 410,000 stores and in total generate annual sales of 
approximately $9 billion. In this way, the profitability of these companies depends mostly on the efficient management 
of their inventories and order fulfillment (First Research 2023). As for Peru, bodegas and markets are the channels 
preferred by Peruvians, since, according to a report by Kantar División Worlpanel Perú, each of the channels 
represents 31.5% of the family basket spending (El Comercio 2022). Therefore, the role of the distributor is essential 
to be able to supply them and comply with the client. On the other hand, SMEs worldwide have a strategic importance 
in economic growth, due to their great contribution in terms of production, sales and development. They are also the 
largest employer, providing security for the majority of people (Alexander et al. 2019). In this way, in 2022, SMEs 
represented 96.4% of Peruvian companies and employed 45.8% of the EAP (Comex 2022).f

one that occurs most frequently and has the greatest impact on returned orders. Nevertheless, we were not able to 
reach the target of 2%, which was initially proposed, remaining 0.25 percentage points short.   
  
The 5S tool was used to improve the quantity and presentation of incorrect products. In this case, an improvement of 
34.6% was obtained compared to the initial situation. Although the proposed objective was not reached exactly, the 
percentage obtained is very close to it, so it is considered that the improvement of this indicator was achieved correctly.  
  
In the case of the average picking time per list, this indicator measures whether the implementation of the 5S meant 
an improvement in the company. From the data obtained from the warehouse, an improvement in picking time can be 
seen, which is reflected in this indicator. Thus, a 33% decrease in the indicator is observed, so it can be validated that 
the implementation of the 5S meant a reduction in the time spent by this activity and, therefore, a benefit for the 
company. 
 
5.4 Validation 
This article focuses on reducing the number of products rejected by customers. This problem is evident in the high 
percentage of returns that the company obtained in 2022, which was 7%, exceeding the return policy of leading 
companies, which is 5% (Bonilla et al. 2019). In addition. the lost sales of these products represented an economic 
impact of S/. 1,420,056.46, an amount that is equivalent to 7.84% of the gross income of the company. In this way, 
with the application of the Lean and TQM tools, it has been possible to lower this percentage to 5.32% and obtain 
improvements in each of the indicators that can be observed in table 1. With the application of the 5S it was possible 
to reduce the number of errors that occurred when assembling orders, and with the application of work standardization 
and TQM it was possible to reduce the number of defective products that were delivered to customers. 
 
For the correct application of the tools and to maintain the results over time, it is very important to train the workers 
and explain the tools so that they can understand the reason for their implementation and its importance to achieve the 
results. In this way, placing the methodology through panels or posters, it will seek to motivate the workers and that 
the tools are present in their day to day. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Through the research presented, it has been concluded that the use of the Lean Service method gives positive results 
in the reduction of losses in a company in the mass consumption sector. Likewise, an improvement has been observed 
in all the indicators proposed for the case of the company.  
  
By using the 5S tool for the entire picking area, it has been possible to reduce the number of hours for this process, in 
addition to having a more orderly space with greater viability of the products. On the other hand, by applying the 
process standardization tool, a better organization of the products in the trucks has been achieved to reduce the number 
of damaged products and, by applying the TQM methodology, an improvement in the quality of processes and 
products delivered to the customer has been seen,  
  
Finally, the simulation model has been validated in the Arena software with 122 runs and the results obtained were 
beneficial and considerable for the companies in this area.

Abstract 
The textile sector in Peru has been growing over the years. This growth has generated an increase in 
the production of textile products, standing out among international markets for the quality of products 
and fibers used in the country. Indeed, textile companies mean a lot for the country's economy, so it is 
important that these companies produce textile products in the most efficient way and can be 
competitive in the international market. Therefore, this research seeks to improve the efficiency in the 
cutting area of a Peruvian textile company. As main problems of the low efficiency of the company in 
the cutting area, problems such as poor preparation of activities and an excess of time in the 
replenishment of materials were found. In order to solve this problem and reach a level of 90% 
efficiency in the area, the use of Lean tools such as SMED and Work Standardization was proposed. 
These allow a better time management and level of preparation for the operations in the area. Also, 
Arena software is used to simulate the current model and the improvement proposal. The situations 
are compared, and the margin of improvement is identified after the application of the tools.

1. Introduction
In Peru, garment manufacturing has been one of the activities with the highest economic growth,
representing 1.9 percent of the country's GDP. The quality of textile products manufactured throughout
the country reflects the good practices employed by Peruvian companies. Even in challenging
scenarios, many companies have been able to adapt to change; for instance, during the COVID-19
pandemic, they shifted production to create essential safety items such as medical uniforms, masks,
and other garments. According to the Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, the textile and garment
sector in Peru is a major source of formal employment, generating over 250,000 jobs (Velarde-
Álvarez, 2022). The tradition of manufacturing threads, fabrics, and various garments is also
highlighted. With access to the world's finest cotton, such as Pima cotton, many international brands
tend to manufacture their garments in Peru.

129",,"is employed to ensure efficient operations throughout the cutting area, reducing idle time in work cells 
and transportation times for each garment.  
Activities like spreading and bagging are adjusted to achieve the desired efficiency for the company. 
In the case of spreading, the task time is reduced by 2.77 minutes per garment, and for the bagging 
activity, pre-activity preparation allows achieving a time of 10.04 minutes.  
Finally, the results are compared with the research indicators, and it is observed that an improvement 
is achieved in the order's Lead Time, reducing the number of reprocessed garments, and achieving a 
lower value of out-of-spec items. Table 1 displays the simulation results.

6. conclusión   
The problem of low efficiency in the cutting area of a textile company has allowed us to thoroughly 
examine the root causes that generate this issue. The identification of solution tools, such as the 
implementation of SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) and the use of Work Standardization, has 
successfully achieved the research objective.  
Data collection to simulate the cutting area problem is carried out for the purpose of validating the 
model and the implementation of the tools. Thus, the model demonstrates feasibility and resolves the 
existing issues within the cutting area.  
Working with different clients and varying order volumes, the company enhances garment production 
by considering standardized setup times, downtime, and operations. This approach enables the 
identification of periods of low performance.

Abstract 
The occupational circumstances and working conditions of traffic police personnel pose challenges to maintaining 
law enforcement in rapidly growing Indian cities and towns. Their vigilant operations in all weather conditions are 
crucial for effective traffic management and regulation. However, the nature of their work exposes them to both 
physical and psychological impacts, causing stress. This research aimed to identify and examine factors affecting the 
mental and physical well-being of traffic police personnel in North Bangalore, Karnataka, India. The study identified 
physical factors, working conditions, workplace stress, and coping mechanisms as significant causes of stress. A 
survey was conducted, gathering responses from 77 traffic police personnel. Data analysis utilized SPSS software, 
including reliability tests for questionnaire evaluation and hypothesis testing through multiple linear regression to 
identify factors contributing to mental and physical health. Results revealed that physical health, working conditions, 
and workplace stress significantly influenced mental health, while coping mechanisms significantly impacted physical 
health among traffic police personnel. These findings highlight the heightened stress levels experienced by traffic 
policemen, demanding attention from higher authorities. Regular stress management training is recommended to 
enhance their work efficacy and overall well-being.

I. Introduction
Engineering is a critical field that shapes the world we live in. From infrastructure development to
technological advancements, engineers play a pivotal role in driving progress. However, this field
has faced a persistent issue – the underrepresentation of women, Figure 1. The percentage of
female engineers and computer professionals varies by specialization. Only 9% of mechanical
engineers are female compared to 35% of environmental engineers. In the computer industry, only
18% of software developers and 32% of computer and information research scientists are women.
Advancing diversity and inclusion for women in engineering is not only a matter of social justice
but also essential for fostering innovation, creativity, and a robust engineering community (Kumar
2023; Leong 2023, 2005, 2014b, 2006a, 2006b).
The field of engineering has long been characterized by a significant gender imbalance, with 
women underrepresented in both academia and industry (Catalyst 2013; Leong 2022a, 2023b). 
This paper explores the importance of advancing diversity and inclusion for women in engineering, 
addressing the historical context, current challenges, and potential solutions. We discuss the 
benefits of a more diverse engineering workforce, the barriers women face, and highlight

Abstract 
The field of engineering has made significant strides in technological advancements, yet it 
continues to grapple with the challenge of achieving diversity and inclusion, particularly for 
women. This paper aims to explore the importance of diversity and inclusion in engineering, with 
a specific focus on promoting women's participation. By examining the current state of the field, 
identifying barriers and challenges, and highlighting successful strategies and initiatives, this paper 
aims to provide insights into how engineering can evolve into a more inclusive and innovative 
domain. Engineering is a cornerstone of technological progress, shaping the world around us. 
However, the lack of diversity in the engineering workforce, particularly the underrepresentation 
of women, poses a significant obstacle to achieving optimal innovation and problem-solving. This 
paper seeks to address the importance of fostering diversity and inclusion in engineering, focusing 
on strategies to empower and support women in the field. Promoting diversity and inclusion for 
women in engineering is not just an ethical imperative; it is a strategic necessity for the progress 
of the field and society at large. By addressing barriers, implementing effective strategies, and 
fostering an inclusive culture, the engineering community can create a more equitable and 
innovative future.

J. Social and Ethical Responsibility:
Promoting diversity and inclusion is not just a strategic advantage; it's also a matter of social and
ethical responsibility. It aligns with principles of fairness, equity, and equal opportunity for all
individuals.
Based on Figure 4, Among 25- to 34-year-olds with a STEM bachelor’s degree, the proportion of 
women employed in engineering and computing occupations is lower than that of men of the same 
racial/ethnic background. Moreover, the proportion of Black and Hispanic women is more than 
two times lower than that of White men. 
In conclusion, diversity and inclusion for women in engineering benefit not only the individuals 
involved but also the engineering profession, organizations, and society as a whole. By fostering 
diversity and creating an inclusive environment, the engineering field can unlock untapped 
potential, drive innovation, and contribute to a more equitable and prosperous future.

Abstract 
Resistance spot welding (RSW) is a crucial metal joining process across diverse industries, with a prominent role in 
the automotive industry. This paper proposes a conceptual framework of data-driven welding analytics by building a 
machine learning (ML) model and parameter-less optimization algorithm to assess the weldability of spot welded 
joints. It leverages experimental and simulation data to train the ML model, enabling it to predict weld quality 
accurately. Various regression-based Machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict weld nugget size. The 
performance of these algorithms is evaluated by three performance measures: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean 
Square Error (MSE), and R-squared. The result shows that Gaussian process regression outperforms other ML 
algorithms in predicting weld quality. Furthermore, in addition to welding analytics, the proposed framework 
incorporates a Teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm to optimize expected weld quality. The 
robustness of this optimization algorithm is confirmed through 10 independent runs, maintaining consistent population 
size and termination criteria.

1. Introduction
Resistance spot welding (RSW) finds extensive application in sheet metal fabrication within automotive, aerospace, 
rail vehicles, and home appliances owing to its simplicity, high production rate, and ease of adoption of automation 
Hamidinejad et al. (2012). The several car brands and models contain an average of 3000-6000 numbers of the spot 
to assembly the body in white (BIW). It works on the principle of Joules heating. In RSW, the essential heat required 
for coalescence is generated by passing an electric current through a stack of sheets sandwiched between electrodes 
(see Figure 1). The amount of heat generated can be expressed by the equations. 
H= I2RT  
(1) 
Where H is heat energy in joules, I is current in amperes, R is resistance in ohms, and t is the time for the current to 
pass through the sheet in seconds. RSW represents a complex thermos-mechanical process involving thermal, 
electrical, mechanical, and metallurgical phenomena Zhang (2006). This complex phenomenon substantially impacts 
the overall quality and integrity of the welded joints. The quality of the weld joint is assessed by nugget size, weld 
strength (Tensile shear strength, Cross tensile strength, peel strength, fatigue strength), modes of failures, micro-
hardness, and metallographic evaluation(Jagadeesha 2017; Kishore et al. 2021; Rao et al. 2017). Several methods are 
available to estimate the quality of welds classified as destructive and non-destructive. In the destructive method, the 
weld joint is physically separated by applying an external force, allowing for the assessment of quality characteristics. 
However, it is time-consuming and cumbersome and cannot be applied for inline testing. However, in non-destructive 
methods, weld quality is estimated using sensor and ultrasonic testing without separating the weld joint Triyono et al. 
(2011).

5. Conclusion 
The present study proposed a robust framework designed to predict and optimize the weldability of the RSW process. 
It incorporates all analytics phases, from real-time data collection to prediction of weld quality to optimization of the 
process parameters. The machine learning algorithm employed in this paper has significant potential to enhance 
prediction accuracy and add intelligence to the welding process. This approach can reduce the time required for 
destructive testing, substantially improving production efficiency by reducing lead time and overall operational costs. 
The novelty of proposed framework is not only to predict the weld quality but also optimize the predicted value. The 
beauty of this optimization algorithm is that it requires only population size and termination criteria, eliminating the 
need for algorithm-specific parameters that often require meticulous selection along with population size and 
termination criteria. 
However, this framework is not limited to only RSW. It may also be applied to other joining processes like l arc 
welding, laser welding, friction stir welding, TIG/MIG welding, etc

Abstract 
Additive manufacturing attains supply chain resilience by enabling localized production, reducing prototyping time 
through swift design iterations, and achieving on-demand manufacturing by crafting customized products when 
required. These advantages stem from its interconnected layer-by-layer fabrication process, redefining traditional 
manufacturing approaches. Like other industries, AM exhibits intricate parameter interdependencies, necessitating 
novel predictive models. In this study we used a dataset obtained from PLA-based Additive manufacturing process 
and used data-driven methodologies on the dataset including measurements of input and output parameters.  
The study aims to predict energy consumption, print duration, and object weight based on input variables - layer 
thickness, printing speed, and line infill pattern. We used advanced machine learning techniques including linear 
regression, decision trees and random forests to create a predictive model for data driven decision making. 
We segregated the collected data into two distinct sets: a training set which was used to train the machine learning 
model, and a test set to assess the model's performance on unseen data. This approach ensures the model's robustness 
and ability to generalize, allowing it to make accurate predictions for real-world additive manufacturing scenarios. 
Results highlight machine learning's efficacy in forecasting output parameters. The research emphasizes the potential 
of computational models for real-time process control. It enhances resource efficiency by minimizing material waste 
and energy consumption. Collectively, these outcomes empower companies to streamline processes, make informed 
choices, and ultimately deliver high-quality products efficiently and competitively echoing the trend of data-driven 
transformations in manufacturing.

1. Introduction
Additive manufacturing (AM) represents a innovative digital manufacturing method for creating three-dimensional 
objects, typically by layering materials based on computer-aided design (CAD) models. In contrast to traditional 
manufacturing techniques, AM offers several benefits, including the ability to produce intricate components with 
intricate shapes and structures, distinct microstructural characteristics, and properties, all while reducing time and 
expenses. Consequently, AM has garnered substantial attention in both academic research and global industrial 
applications in recent times (Wang et al. 2020). 
Machine learning is pivotal for additive manufacturing (AM) process control, offering numerous advantages. It 
optimizes printing parameters by analyzing data, ensuring efficient material usage and reduced waste. Machine 
learning aids in real-time defect detection, minimizing the production of faulty parts. Predictive models forecast part 
quality, allowing for early intervention if deviations occur. It enables predictive maintenance, ensuring AM machines

Abstract 
Currently, the global growth of logistics costs and socio-environmental problems are upward trends. In line with this, 
reverse logistics is a tool with great potential, as it is a viable alternative to respond to this problem. In this sense, the 
present research work aims to analyze, compare, and interrelate the existing literature regarding reverse logistics as a 
solution to the problem posed. For this, a review of the concepts of supply chain, reverse logistics, costs, environmental 
impact, corporate social reputation, among other concepts was carried out. Then, through the methodology of the 
systematic review of the literature, the results obtained from the analysis of a universe of thirty papers will be 
displayed. After the analysis is carried out, the literature behavior and trends will be exposed through the classification 
of the studies in fourteen categories, with special emphasis on the main benefits found when applying reverse logistics 
in companies, the most recurrent being the following: socio-environmental, economic, and commercial benefits. These 
are observed in multiple types of companies, sectors, and geographical spaces. Among them, industrial-type 
companies stand out in the retail, electronics, and construction sectors in the geographical area of Asia. This showed 
that the application of reverse logistics is viable, being an ideal path for a sustainable transformation towards more 
efficient and environmentally friendly operations.

1. Introduction
Supply chain and logistics are pivotal for any organization's operations. ""Supply Chain Management"" by Chopra and 
Meindl (2020) stresses the importance of achieving optimal profitability through effective service and market focus. 
These concepts also profoundly impact an organization's sustainability and operational strategies (Gechevski et al. 
2016). Today, discussions about the environmental impact of logistics costs are on the rise. A recent environmental 
report has revealed a troubling increase in methane levels, a potent greenhouse gas. According to Statista's 2023 data, 
methane levels have risen by 12% from 1990 to 2023. In parallel, logistic costs are also escalating. A Statista chart 
(2022) demonstrates a 54% increase in US business logistics costs from 2005 to 2021. Amazon, an industry giant, 
experienced a remarkable 204% surge in fulfillment and shipping expenses from 2017 to 2021. This surge led to a

Abstract 
The haphazard industrial waste management of the industries located on the banks of the rivers is seen as a cause of 
the South Asian region's rivers becoming polluted. Densely populated areas also get polluted from improper 
management of trash collection by the government. There on the rivers, the Energy Efficient River Surface Floating 
Plastic Trash Cleaning and Oil Soaking Robot can be used to clean the floating trash from the river surface and can 
simultaneously soak the oil from the river water. This robot uses river skimmer technology to filter floating trash from 
the river's edge. The robot's forearms are attached to an oil-absorbing hydrophobic melamine sponge material, which 
allows the floating robot to absorb oil from river water. The design and construction of this robot for cleaning and 
soaking up oil are discussed in this paper. The floating trash that comes with the tide is blocked by the hands of this 
machine. The filtered trash is then collected by a cleated conveyor belt controlled by an Arduino UNO R3 SMD 
microcontroller. Using a CM30-25NPP-EC1 Capacitive Proximity Sensor, this cleated conveyor belt separates plastic 
waste. The sensing end of the sensor emits an electrical field from 4mm up to 25mm, in order to detect the plastic 
trash. Throughout this experiment, the design of hardware orientation and software operation for the robot’s operation 
is explained with construction. The eminent idiosyncrasies can also be used for future skimmer technology based 
robots, which will be capable of completing tasks with complex functionality.

Abstract 
This study relates to an assessment for the potential to produce liquid oils by co-processing coal fines with municipal 
solid plastics waste using red mud from aluminium processing as a catalyst. This research seeks to promote 
environmental sustainability by utilising waste coal fines and municipal solid waste without creating health and 
environmental hazards. Using municipal solid plastic waste in the process enabled large scale production which 
reduced costs and prevented downtimes and improved plant economics. Co-processing of coal fines with municipal 
waste plastics is a brilliant solution for an affordable, fuel from locally available raw materials which securing energy 
supply, promoting economic sustainability and protected the climatic changes associated with waste management. 
From experimental work, it was observed that higher temperatures and lower space velocities increase the formation 
of coke and gas which decreases the yield of oil. All experimental runs were conducted at 350-375 oC and a liquid 
hourly speed velocity of 0.70-1.70/ hat hydrogen pressure of 6 MPa yielding oils of 24-34 wt.% for naphtha, 34-45 
wt.% for middle distillates and heavy distillates 18-25 wt.%. Co-processing of coal fines and municipal waste is a 
good waste valorization strategy to produce liquid fuels.

A lot of studies on the liquefaction of coal to liquid fuels have been at the lead regarding ways of finding profitable 
energy approaches in the whole world (Akah and Al-Ghrami  2015; Khan et al. 2016). Coal has been regarded as the 
potential raw material during production of liquid fuels because of its abundance in all nations including Zimbabwe 
(Ayres et al. 2001). Coal as a natural resource contain more carbon content and provide very little amounts of hydrogen 
content, therefore there is need to produce large quantities of hydrogen which is quite expensive as it counts a

and gases and thus decrease the overall wt.% yield of oil. Therefore, higher temperatures allow the 
use of higher space velocities such as 1.75 h1. The liquid hourly space velocity is calculated as 
represented in Equation 1. The liquid hourly space velocity is a method for relating the reactant 
liquid flow rate to the reactor volume at a standard temperature. The volumetric flow rate is treated 
as a liquid at these conditions, even though the actual material may be a gas under normal operating 
conditions (Jijiang et al. 2022). . Lower space velocities cause the formation amounts of coke 
which deposit in the pores of the catalyst thus causing a decrease in the pore volume.

6. Conclusion
Coal fines and waste municipal plastics can be successfully co-processed to liquid fuels as a waste
management strategy using red mud as a catalyst. From this study, it was evident that using red
mud as a catalyst increases most of the properties of the fuel and also promotes environment
sustainability in the form of less emission and fuel consumption. Since red mud is a hazardous
waste material from the aluminum industry, utilizing it for liquid fuels productions is an
economically viable option. The temperature of 475 oC gives higher space velocities of 1.75h-1
which results in higher yields of 84.9%. This applied to all the temperatures investigated with the
exception of 375 oC where a lower space velocity resulted in a higher wt.% yield of oil. The
production of liquid oils from coal fines, waste municipal plastics and red mud is a good waste
management initiative.

This work focused on the valorization of piggery industry slurry to bio energy and bio fertilizers. A sample of piggery 
slurry wastewater was treated using a bio catalyst, Actizyme at 0.050 g/L loading, resulting in reduction of the 
biological oxygen demand (BOD) by 97%, the total dissolved solids (TDS) by 89% and the total suspended solids 
(TSS) by 98%. The solid material from the slurry was anaerobically digested to produce biogas with 73.4% methane 
composition over a period of 30 days and temperature of 37 ◦C at a commercial rate of 494 kg/day. The techno 
economic assessment for the piggery slurry valorization indicated a return on investment of 26% and payback period 
of 4 years and a capital investment of USD 820 000.

1. Introduction
The need for wastewater management and affordable renewable energy has attracted a lot of attention globally 
(Adumasu et al. 2022). This is an area of concern even in the agricultural sector in Zimbabwe and the agricultural and 
livestock production has been increasing for the past five years. However, it is causing considerable environmental 
problems, mostly air and water pollution. The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) is the statutory body 
responsible for the protection of the environment and has enforced laws to protect the environment but it seems as if 
most of the pig farms are not following them (Tshuma, 2010). Pig slurry can be used as natural fertilizer, but it is the 
major source of these compounds. Most pig farms result in excessive production of liquid manure which surpasses 
the receiving capacities of their farmland and some use inorganic fertilizer because of the odor and bacteria in the 
slurry (Ajeej et al. 2015). Therefore, it becomes very crucial to develop efficient methods of processing this pig slurry. 
There are three ways commonly used to treat piggery slurry which include bio fertilizer production, composting and 
biogas generation. Biogas generation has proved to be more efficient because its advantages which include improved 
bio-fertilizer, reduced costs for heating, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and reduced leaching of nutrients. Treating 
it with Acti-zyme (bio catalyst) has a potential to further increase its value.

9. Conclusion
Biogas and bio-fertilizer can be co-generated from bio-catalyzed anaerobic digestion of pig slurry.
Bio catalytic treatment of piggery catalyst can efficiently convert waste into valuable products that
is clean water, bio fertilizers and biogas. The treated effluent met the set standards for effluent
water disposal and biogas was produced with a bio-methane composition of about 73.4%. The bio
catalytic bio digestion of pig slurry using proves to be an attractive way of producing clean and
renewable energy for use as well as bio fertilizers.

Abstract 
Purpose- The paper aims to investigate the status quo of 4IR in the South African Higher Education Institutions 
Design/methodology/approach- The study adopted a survey design with different South African university students 
in Gauteng province using quota-sampling method. This was done through structured questionnaire. Percentage, 
frequency mean score and exploratory factor analysis were used to analyse the collected data.  
Findings- findings showed that the current status of 4IR is susceptible & made easy, the existing 4IR infrastructure 
needs to be mended, the universities have a blended learning approach, the nature of learning has not been transferred 
to digital learning, the full potential of 4IR has not being realised to outdated infrastructure and the 4IR adoption is 
very low due to its costs. The most rated benefits included the demographic effect of different socio-economic status 
affecting the students with adopting 4IR, the 4IR infrastructure is still under review & improvement in universities as 
well as that the infrastructure lack exclusive rights to many available technology innovations. 
Practical implications- This research paper was conducted in Gauteng province. The findings therefore show a true 
reflection of the status quo of 4IR in the South African higher institutions.

Introduction 
Higher education institutions in South Africa are failing to encounter the basics of digital students as educational 
schemes, commercial procedures, and learning simulations, which are not consumer dedicated (Schuetze and Slowey 
2002). Witford (2006), stated that the educational infrastructure in classrooms is not developing in South African 
higher institutions. Therefore, it should be adjusted to keep pace with innovative and cultural changes. There is a need 
to gain the upper hand in this rapidly evolving world, and businesses should adopt the 4IR (Nayyar 2016). Hence, the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution should give a portion of the answers for such difficulties, as expanded effectively of the 
value chain using advances like information examination, sensors, computerized reasoning and the Internet of Things 
(IoT). Adendorff and Putzier (2018), pointed out that the absence of acquisitions by government and industries could 
lead to South Africa being lag behind “‘without a friend in the world’” while different nations, including those of the 
African continent, grasp the 4IR ways. It enables the individuals to share information and access data and instruction. 
However, a general lack of abilities is one of the reasons for Africa’s failure to take part in the 4IR development (City 
Press 2016). Adendorff and Putzier (2018), stated that issues lie in the absence of required skills if the country 
implements the 4IR. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the status quo of the fourth industrial revolution in the 
South African higher institution.

Conclusion 
The literature review in this section found that the fourth industrial revolution and its constituents are needful on HEIs 
infrastructure as it makes students attain good academic results with its recommended technology and innovation. For 
students to achieve excellent academic performance, the universities must overcome the challenges caused by the 
unenhanced educational infrastructure within the universities. Since it has been identified beyond reasonable doubt 
that HEIs are encompassed with challenges centred on inadequate educational infrastructure and, arguably, skilled 
personnel. 4IR is therefore required.

Abstract: 
Lean tools have proven the importance for eliminating wastes, and improving process, however this methodology 
is not sufficient for sustainable progress. Sustainability takes a very important place in the overall strategy's 
companies. It is a response to the various issues for industrial companies as economic, environmental, social, and 
stakeholder’s pressure. The integration between green and lean can be a way to build greener health care system. 
The present study proposes a self-assessment model to assess the degree of green lean maturity within organization, 
using the worst best method (BWM) as multi criteria decision-making framework.  For this, a literature review 
was conducted to analyze the strengths and limitations of different frameworks and models of Green Lean 
approach. The proposed tool was implemented in manufacturing company operating in the pharmaceutical sector. 
The proposed assessment model provides guidelines and operating conditions to companies wishing implementing 
Green Lean. The outcomes of this study will help pharmaceutical companies to carry out the Green Lean initiatives 
in order to contribute to sustainability and then to the overall performance of the company.

Abstract 
Staff turnover in large Peruvian manufacturing industries has been increasing in recent years.  While job rotation 
is a natural effect in organizations, it generates higher training costs for new staff and impacts work performance 
and climate when unwanted. Given this problem arises the need to identify the possible causes of rotation of 
operational personnel and predict these events through data analysis at an early stage to avoid and reduce its impact 
on the company. This article of quantitative approach and exploratory scope-explanatory aims to identify the 
propensity of rotation of the operation of a company manufacturing cleaning and disinfection through a model of 
forecast by collecting data using Machine Learning and encourage proposals that enable solutions to be found to 
the factors influencing staff turnover. MS Excel and Orange software were used for data analysis, where the data 
were trained with different intelligence models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and 
SVM, and Python to run the model and get numerical indicators like the Area under the curve (AUC) and the 
analysis of the ROC curve. The proposed study shows that the models perform well in classification, with high 
accuracy and recall rates, 96% and 97%, respectively, and an overall accuracy of 96%.

Introduction 
Omondiagbe et al. (2019). Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing software 
that can change according to exposure to new data; its development uses past data that helps the classification 
process, prediction, and detection. According to Ifft and Kuhnsb, not all Machine Learning models are ideal for 
prediction. However, most have greater predictive power than standard models, improving performance when 
analysis variables are well selected (Armendariz and Zuñiga 2018). 
King (2016) Data analysis in Human Resources Development is increasingly common since it favors 
comprehensive data organization and helps decision-making.  
Nocker and Sena (2019). Predictive analysis is the most common type of analysis used by HR departments. It has 
been implemented in several contexts, such as modeling staff turnover and employee engagement. The main 
objective of applying Predictive Analysis in Human Resources is to optimize performance and produce a better 
return on investment for organizations through decision-making based on data collection, HR metrics, and 
predictive models. (Sujeet et al. 2016).

These results suggest that all four models are promising for the three-class classification problem, with high AUC 
values in the ROC curve. However, it is important to note that other metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-
score, must also be considered for a complete evaluation of the performance of the models in terms of accurate 
classification of each class and the balance between them.

Table 5 shows the summary results of evaluating the four machine learning models regarding precision, F1 score, 
recall, and accuracy. In the logistic regression model, a precision of 0.97, an F1-score of 0.96, a recall of 0.96, and 
an accuracy of 0.96 are obtained. In the case of the decision tree, a precision of 0.93, an F1-score of 0.93, a recall 
of 0.93, and an accuracy of 0.93 are observed. The Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models 
present consistent results, with precision, F1-scores, recall, and accuracies of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively.  
These results indicate that the models have good classification performance, high precision and recall rates, and 
an overall accuracy of 96%. 
 
Conclusions 
According to the results obtained, we can conclude that operational personnel's most significant number of 
dismissals occurs because they receive a better job offer, representing 54% of the total resignations between 2018 
and 2021. This reason why It is classified as an unexpected event and as a decision of a personal nature with a 
negative impact on the company because it entails costs that are sometimes not noticeable at first glance; as 
Suzanne Lucas mentions, the decrease in productivity, since the person who leaves the position leaves the specific

functions assigned to him, which must be assumed by some of his colleagues, who do not necessarily have the 
specific knowledge to do so, thus also incurring other costs called work overload. And lost ability, respectively (as 
cited in Evaluar, parr. 1). It is the machine learning models that provide us with a demonstrably effective tool to 
determine the propensity for voluntary resignation of the operational staff of the cleaning and disinfection 
company, reaching 96% accuracy and thus reducing turnover rates.  
 
Recommendations 
It is recommended to incorporate the exit survey with previously defined questions as part of the offboarding 
process since the information obtained will be of great importance to continue feeding previous data and build 
rotation indicators and have better control of it. Likewise, it would be ideal to work on implementing a potential 
turnover survey of all workers who are still in the company to find the reasons that are causing discomfort or job 
dissatisfaction and increase the worker's desire to resign. To your workplace. Based on the results where the highest 
turnover percentage is due to a better job offer, reviewing and updating the existing benefits for workers and 
generating an approach according to the current age group is ideal. All issues related to organizational culture must 
also be reinforced to make each of its workers feel like a brand ambassador and build their loyalty. In this way, 
the best work environment will be maintained, thanks to the alert presented by the prediction model, and managers 
will be able to make better decisions with their immediate subordinates so that attrition does not occur.

Abstract 
In this study, the production of activated biochar capsules from sawdust for multipurpose medicinal use was 
investigated as a value addition strategy. The sawdust was chemically activated using phosphoric acid at a 
temperature of 450 oC in the absence of oxygen to give a 52.2% of activated biochar from the sawdust. The 
activated biochar’s ash content was 4.0%, moisture content 2.0% and the iodine number 431 mg/g. A process was 
designed for the production of activated biochar capsules for multipurpose medicinal use. An environmental 
analysis was done taking for proper site selection and plant layout. An economic analysis carried out indicated a 
return on investment of 44% and a payback period of 2.3 years. Saw dust can be economically value added to 
activated biochar capsules as a waste management initiative.

1. Introduction
Health care in the developing countries is expensive and a few people can afford it leading to high mortality rates 
(Bloom et al. 2004; (Odesola and Owoseni 2010)). Usually health aspects as dental care, skin care and digestive 
system care in the developing countries are overlooked since more emphasis is put on major diseases such as 
malaria and cholera due to the high cost of the medication (Bloom et al. 2004; (Noor et al. 2015). On the other 
hand, the timber industry in Zimbabwe produces close to 10 000 metric tonnes of saw dust per year of which 10% 
of it is used as an energy source and the rest is dumped in the areas close to the sawmills (Makonese 2016). The 
underutilisation of this sawdust in the past years has led to land pollution and veld fires as local people have tried

11. Conclusion 
The assessment for the production of activated biochar capsules from sawdust as a climate change and waste 
management strategy was found to be technically and economically feasible. Preliminary cost estimation for the 
plant was found to have a rate of return of 44% and a payback period of 2.3 years. Measures to protect the 
environment were put in consideration with analysis of every possible environmental pollution and its mitigation

measure. Site selection and plant layout were done to locate the plant at the most economical location. From this 
study, it is recommended that the pyrolysis of sawdust to produce activated biochar releases heat; hence it is 
suggested that heat integration is done so that the heat from the furnace can be reused for another pyrolysis 
reaction. Pyrolysis gas can be condensed to produce bio oil which is a fuel. This fuel can then be used for operating 
the pyrolysis reactor and other equipment as the spray and rotary driers and minimise their emission to the 
environment. Waste valorisation of saw dust to biochar based capsules for potential medicinal uses is essential in 
combatting climate change.

Abstract 
One of the problems faced in the Philippines is the rise and long-term stay of Food Insecurity 
among Filipinos. 54.9 million Filipinos are food insecure according to the 2020 Integrated Food 
Security Phase Classification. Inconsistent access to food is related to students' poor physical, 
psychological, and emotional well-being. Students who experience food insecurity exhibit 
increased stress, worsening sleeping, irregular eating habits, and worse academic success. The 
main objective of this study is to determine the correlation of food insecurity indicators and 
academic performance of college students among University Belt Manila in the academic year 
2022-2023. This study focuses on the correlation between Food Insecurity Indicators and 
Academic Performance, the four Food Insecurity Indicators are Food Insecurity Prevalence, Food 
Insecurity Severity, Meal Totality, and Food Budget. Academic Performance Dependent Variables 
will be General Weighted Average (GWA), Class Participation, and Class Attentiveness. 
Structural Equation Modeling or SEM statistical analysis is used in this study, upon conducting a 
300-sample statistical analysis on SPSS Basic and AMOS, the results shows that Food Insecurity
Prevalence has correlation to Class Attentiveness, Food Insecurity Severity has correlation to both
GWA and Class Participation, and Food Budget has correlation with Class Attentiveness. In
conclusion, there is a correlation between Food Insecurity indicators and Academic Performance
among University-Belt students staying in dormitories in the academic year 2022 - 2023. Widening
the knowledge on Food Insecurity on its possible effects on student’s academic performance would
be more beneficial to the community. These outcomes enable future researchers to carry out this
study by providing or seeking government solutions to affected individuals within Manila.

Abstract 
Processes management allows improvement in management and productivity since it allows to have a 
global vision of the entire organization, at the same time, lean manufacturing tools help to improve 
production/administrative systems and encourage continuous improvement. This work proposes a 
continuous improvement model that brings together the two aforementioned approaches, taking the PDCA 
cycle as a starting model. The methodology used in this work begins with a bibliographic review of the 
topics of interest, process management and lean manufacturing tools, then an analysis of the PDCA 
improvement cycle is carried out, focusing on the scope and objective of each stage. Finally, an 
improvement management model is presented that suggests which lean manufacturing tools are the most 
appropriate to develop each of the stages of the PDCA cycle. The results show that the proposals effectively 
combine these tools, and their implementation is feasible in companies of all kinds, regardless of their size 
and activity. The proposed model was tested through a pilot test in a footwear manufacturing industry 
located in the city of Cuenca-Ecuador with results consistent with the philosophy of continuous 
improvement.

1. Introduction
Currently, SMEs face various and complex problems, but without a doubt one of the most critical aspects is inadequate 
management in aspects such as inventory control, optimization of production processes, education of human talent, 
among others. In many SMEs there are no process manuals that guide the manufacturing of different products, 
likewise, there is no adequate organization of work tools in different positions. SMEs cannot always be managed like

5. Conclusion  
Process management and lean manufacturing tools are a great help to improve manufacturing processes in companies 
that use them, since they improve productivity, quality, and manufacturing systems in general. A big problem usually 
faced by SMEs is that sometimes they see limited opportunities for improvement for fear of getting complicated with 
highly technical models or high investment, however it can be seen that the mixture of these two tools, process 
management and lean manufacturing, facilitate the tasks of m, so its application allows microenterprises to carry out 
improvement actions with low investment. 
 
It is recommended to the managers of the microenterprise Jotta Shoes to carry out the improvement plans in a 
meticulous way so that its application provides positive results and to be able to solve the existing problems in the 
best way. It is important to mention that, for the plans to give the best results, all the members of the microenterprise 
must work together and keep them constantly motivated to avoid the inertia of old practices. Another more 
technological help can be found in ERP software that can help monitor a company's processes. Although these 
solutions are usually expensive for SMEs, there are today low-cost, high-quality solutions like the one you mention 
by Astudillo Rodriguez et. al., (2020), this type of tools together with process management models cause great 
synergies and can substantially increase the performance of a company.

Abstract 
Mobility is a necessity and a factor of prosperity. Moving as a way of life, as trend of living, as the requirements of 
the environment, as need of new generations provoke innovative mobility solutions. Traditional business models are 
not sustainable because they cause a lot of pollution, they are not flexible so they can generate higher financial 
expenses, they are not subject to digital and virtual work models and they are not harmonized with new consumers – 
Generation Z. Therefore, new innovative models are looking for ways to clean, more inclusive, more socialized, self-
creating as well as cheaper, faster ways of mobility. The increased use of applications, the possibilities of flexible 
forms of work, remote work have led to an increase in the popularity of the sharing economy, and the fact that this 
business model is easily accessible and economical, and a large increase in capacity is predicted for it. The concept of 
sharing economy is rapidly developing and expanding and is becoming a significant economic, ecological and social 
phenomenon. The aim of this paper is to analyze the values of a business model of sharing economy through digital 
platforms with an emphasis on carpooling on case study of GoOpti model. In Croatia, driving platforms are Uber, Bolt 
(Taxify), BlablaCar and GoOpti, in addition to those offered via the Facebook page. The scientific contribution of this 
work is manifested in the detection of values of the business model in sharing economy with an emphasis on 
carpooling. The method used in the research is the analysis of empirical features of quantitative features.

Abstract 
In complacence with the ever-growing industrialization of different sectors, more specifically the construction sector, 
electrical and electronic waste management is becoming a global challenge in the construction industry posing 
significant environmental and health challenges. E-waste, if managed effectively, will release significant economic, 
resource and ecological benefits. Most of the construction companies have no information about electronic waste 
management, electronic devices that come from the seller while damaged are sent back to the supplier for exchange. 
Electronics that could not be repaired are sold to scrap yards and some are sent directly into the dumpsite, however, 
there were some electronic wastes stored inside the premises and others stored at the back of the premises directly into 
the ground, which decomposes and possibly affect the environment. The construction companies feel that it is the 
government's responsibility to provide money for electronic waste management otherwise there is no way they could 
manage e-waste in their business because it will not be profitable or else the users must take care of their electronic

was collected using a qualitative method through interviewing the construction professionals. Twelve industry

Introduction 
This study focuses on the assessment of e-waste management in the built environment in South Africa. Information 
and communication technologies (ICT) have led to high levels of e-waste (Heeks et al. 2015). It has been observed 
that e-waste has been increasing both in developing countries as a consequence of organic ICT development as well 
as a consequence of advancements in ICT in other developed countries (Osibanjo et al. 2016; Arya and Kumar 2020). 
Due to these developments, e-waste management in developing countries, such as South Africa, has become critical. 
There is a close connection between electronic products and people's daily lives as economic and technological 
development accelerates, China is one of the countries with the most consumption capacity. E-waste is being generated 
at a rapid rate as electronic products are rapidly upgraded (Wei and Liu 2012). The UN's Global E-Waste Monitor 
(2020) reports that the amount of e-waste generated worldwide in 2019 increased by 21 percent in just five years, with 
Asia producing 24.9 million tons of e-waste and Africa's 2.9 million tons. In parallel with the growth of the 
consumption of electrical and electronic products in China, the recycling market for electronic waste is also growing. 
The government, producers, recyclers, and consumers in a market economy jointly build e-waste recycling and

3. Conclusion 
This paper has reviewed the literature available on e-waste management. The section started by providing an overview 
of e-waste and defining e-waste, before moving on to reviewing the literature on the situation in the South African 
built environment. Furthermore, the paper reviewed the literature on the importance of e-waste on the economy, health 
of persons and the environment. Therefore, the industry needs to take manage waste accordingly so that it doesn't 
threaten the health and safety of the communities.

Abstract 
Huge amounts of municipal sewage sludge, a form of solid waste, are being generated daily  from municipal 
sewage treatment plants. This sewage sludge if not properly treated can cause landfilling problems that can result 
in climate change effects due to greenhouse gases emissions. This generated sewage sludge is rich in phosphorous 
and other nutrients which has potential to be recovered. The current study evaluates the potential to recover 
phosphorous from municipal sewage sludge using gasification as a thermal method followed by alkali treatment 
using NaOH. The sewage sludge was first dewatered to 60% moisture content before it was gasified using hot air 
to convert it into ash for 120 minutes. Gasification at 800 °C was considered as the waste management option for 
the sewage sludge due to its flexibility and energy efficiency. In this study, 50% of the phosphate was recovered 
from the sewage sludge ash with a phosphorous nutrient composition of 6.5-7.5 wt. %. Gasification of sewage 
sludge to recover phosphate oxide and its subsequent alkali treatment to recover phosphate promotes 
environmental preservation at the same time creating a resource for fertilizer production.

1. Introduction
Phosphorous is a key element for fertilizers production and the mineral resources for phosphorous are depleting 
hence the need for alternative sources (Danesh et al. 2018). Phosphorus is an essential nutrient in living organisms. 
Phosphorous can be recovered and used as an alternative to the in fertilizer production or applied directly to crops 
(Zhipeng Zhang et al., 2023). Previous studies have indicated that potential phosphorous shortage are imminent 
hence the urgent need to have alternative sources of phosphorous (Zhenquan Fang et al.2023). 
Alternative sources of phosphorous such as municipal sewage sludge must then be considered for sustainable 
availability of this resource where it is available in large quantities (Stendahl et al. 2002).  
On the other hand, if this phosphorous is not recovered in municipal sewage sludge, it has potential to cause 
environmental problems such as eutrophication (Yimin Huang et al. 2022). It is estimated that approximately 68 
000 m3/day of activated sewage sludge is generated in municipal wastewater treatment plants in Zimbabwe (Onu 
et al. 2023). In addition, if this sewage sludge is left unmanaged, it will result in methane generation in overall 
negative climate change effects (Agoro et al. 2020). Municipal sewage sludge in its dried form has also been 
widely applied as a fertilizer due to the presence of phosphorous as well as other minerals like lime, organic 
compounds and nitrogen. However, unprocessed municipal sewage sludge if applied directly as a bio fertilizer 
has a potential to introduce unwanted contaminants to the soil including heavy metals such as mercury and lead 
(Borah et al.2020).  
Municipal sewage sludge has been valorised to various products using various technologies such as incineration, 
pyrolysis, carbonization and gasification (Callegari et al. 2018). Although traditionally, municipal sewage sludge 
has been managed through incineration to recover phosphorous, gasification has become a topical alternative 
technology (Pareset al. 2017).  
Gasification however, becomes an attractive potential method sewage sludge valorisation to phosphorous due to 
its flexibility and energy efficiency through potential utilization of gas produced through heat integration 
(Samolada and Zabaniotou  2014). In addition, gasification also allows for destruction of available pathogens in 
the municipal sewage sludge making it safer to use (Keiko et al. 2001). During the process of gasification, the 
carbon based material in the sewage sludge is converted to fuel through partial oxidation at temperatures between 
800-1400 °C in the presence of steam. The inorganic matter is then converted into sewage sludge ash (Keiko et
al. 2001).

thereafter was 10% low and this can be attributed to probably disintegration of the sewage sludge ash at higher 
temperatures.

3.5 Process description for phosphorous recovery from sewage sludge ash using NaOH 
treatment 
The sewage sludge ash rich in phosphate oxide that was recovered from then gasification process underwent alkali 
treatment with NaOH to recover phosphorous from the ash (Figure 5). The sewage sludge ash was first mixed 
with NaOH and then heat treated at the optimal temperature of temperatures of 850 ◦C after the treatment the 
mixture was dried at 105 ℃ for 1 hour. An alkali metal phosphate was formed in the process. Water was then 
added in the mixture in the ratio 1: 10 to the solid material to remove other salts that do not dissolve in water such 
as magnesium oxide. The phosphorous was then recovered as a liquid and then underwent evaporation at 105 ℃ 
in the oven. The process description for phosphorous recovery from sewage sludge ash is schematically shown 
Figure 5.

4. Conclusion 
Municipal sewage sludge can be value added through adoption of various technologies for phosphorous recovery. 
Gasification of municipal sewage sludge is a viable technology for phosphorous oxide recovery in municipal 
sewage treatment plants as it also creates an option for heat integration in the process. Optimal gasification of 
sewage sludge at 800 ℃ results and partial oxygen concentration of 0.1% resulted in almost 100% recovery of 
P2O5. The phosphorous recovery through alkali (NaOH) treatment was done for sewage sludge ash of which the 
phosphate content of 6.5-7.5 % was recovered. This was achieved under optimum heat treatment under the alkali 
treatment method at 850 ℃. Sewage sludge valorisation through gasification followed by alkali treatment results 
in high recovery of phosphorous. Further research in this area will include potential recovery of other high use 
minerals such as silica, magnesium and zinc.

Abstract 
The objective of the present investigation was to propose a solution to the excessive generation of waste in a Peruvian 
SME dedicated to the production of sweet arare, combining both the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) and the Lean 
Manufacturing 5S methodologies. The SLP methodology was used to optimize the distribution of the plant according 
to the production process and the 5S methodology proposed specific improvements at each of its stages. Through a 
simulation in the Arena software, it was validated that this solution reduces the proportion of waste produced to 
competitive levels in the industry, in addition to minimizing the material handling distance by 43.77% and the material 
transfer time by 8.75%.

1. Introduction
According to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization or UNIDO (2022), the manufacturing sector 
plays a fundamental role as an engine of shared prosperity. To support this concept, the Economic Commission for 
Latin America and the Caribbean or ECLAC (2017) states that this sector is one of the essential sources of expansion 
of the global economy and generates large investments in research and technological development throughout the 
world. For example, in Peru the manufacturing industry became the lead contributor to the national GDP with an input 
of 2.1%, generated over one million direct jobs and more than 13 million soles in internal taxes (National Industry 
Society 2021). It is worth noting that this sector experienced a growth of 17.7%; in particular, the food industry 
presented growth of 7.4% and, in turn, the manufacturing branch of cocoa, chocolate, and confectionery products grew 
by 13.8% (SNI  2022). However, this growth is not free of difficulties, Gazdecki et al. (2021) point out that waste 
generation is one of the biggest problems in the food industry, due to its negative environmental, economic, and social 
consequences. This is because it leads to a great inefficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, and other resources, 
affecting the competitiveness of companies and therefore their stability in the short and long term. 
In Peru, sweet arare is a newly introduced confectionery product primarily made from rice. An SME dedicated to its 
production faced a nearly 3% annual income loss (1695.66 soles) due to waste generation reaching 1.6% of its total 
production weight (500 grams per lot). This poses a problem for the expansion of its activities, as inefficiencies in its 
production process became evident and could further increase with a higher production volume. The main contributors 
to the elevated waste generation were found to be the unoptimized plant layout and general disorder in the production 
area, as the waste losses exclusively occurred during transfer between activities. Consequently, a solution proposal 
was developed by combining the use of the Systematic Layout Planning and 5S Lean Manufacturing methodologies 
to address each issue respectively. It should be noted that these tools were chosen for the low cost of their 
implementation, which makes them viable alternatives for strategic changes in SMEs in particular. 
This scientific article is divided into 6 chapters: Introduction, Literature Review, Methods, Validation, Results, and 
Conclusions.

area to another to greatly affect their timely response capacity. Considering that timing is one of the most important 
factors in food production, any delays could lead to potentially losing entire production lots. 
 
It should be noted that, if the methodologies employed in this investigation are to be used in another confectionery 
business, a prior analysis of the case must be carried out and their viability must be determined in relation to the root 
cause of the issue. In the case of Ibarra et al. (2019) for example, it was determined that Lean Six Sigma and DMAIC 
were a better fit, leading to a 36.51% decrease in losses. While in both investigations the issue at hand is excessive 
waste loss, in their case, the analyzed company was much larger in size and production volume with the root cause of 
their problems being lax production standards rather than an ineffective layout. The choice of tools to address the issue 
of waste loss is not a constant for all instances, but prior investigations can be used as a referenced when similar 
situations arise even across different industrial sectors. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The present investigation concludes that reducing the waste generation in an SME through the application of the SLP 
and 5S methodologies is possible, achieving the main objective of reaching a level of 1.5% waste over total production 
weight. Additionally, both specific objectives were surpassed, reducing the material handling distance by 43.77% 
(with an original objective of a 30% reduction) and the material transfer time by 8.75% (with an original objective of 
a 5% reduction). Furthermore, this implies that the 2.46% income loss would be reduced to only 2.29%. The reduction 
in income loss implies that more impressive results can be achieved in the future as the company grows over time and 
its operations increase both in complexity and scale.

Abstract 
Background: Musculoskeletal pain is a problem many workers suffer worldwide, triggering more severe diseases and 
decreased quality of life. In addition, several studies have shown that university students are no strangers to suffering 
from these pains, and it is known that more and more of them report pains in different body areas. Therefore, this 
study aims to determine undergraduate students' risk factors associated with musculoskeletal pain. 
Methodology: A systematic literature review followed the process proposed in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The searches were conducted in Scopus, Web of 
Science, and Scielo, obtaining 3311 articles, of which 89 were included for this review. 
Results: Of the 38 possible risk factors, five factors were evaluated, and it was found that physical activity, time in 
front of a screen, and having a history or family history of musculoskeletal pain/trauma do represent a risk factor, 
while no association was found for gender and time in a sedentary position. 
Conclusion: Three risk factors for the presence of musculoskeletal pain were found in the review. In turn, there is 
little existing literature on COVID-19 and its effect on the presence of musculoskeletal pain and associated risk factors 
in undergraduate students, so it is advisable to conduct further research in this context.

1. Introduction
Musculoskeletal pain is pain in ligaments, tendons, muscles, or joints due to repetitive movements, awkward postures, 
or musculoskeletal disorders (Felemban et al. 2021; Ogunlana et al. 2021). According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO  2021), in a study conducted in 2019, it was found that musculoskeletal pain had affected about 
1710 million people worldwide, having negative repercussions on their daily activities, hours of sleep and a significant 
decrease in their productivity (Alkhateeb et al. 2020; Alrumi et al. 2020; Torbey et al. 2023). 
Likewise, according to the existing literature, several studies have shown that university students are no strangers to 
suffering from such pain. Such is the case that, concerning medical school students, in a study conducted in Egypt, it 
was found that the most frequent area of pain was the neck and lower back at 81.1%, followed by the neck with 74.4% 
and the back with 73.1% (Alian et al. 2021). Similarly, another study conducted in Israel found that 80% of students 
suffered from neck pain, 60% from upper back, and 33.3% from shoulder pain (Kaufman-Cohen et al. 2018). 
On the other hand, in the Faculty of Medical Sciences students, a higher prevalence of pain in the neck and lower 
back, also known as the lumbar area, was found. For example, 69.2% of dental students suffer from neck pain, 67.1% 
in the shoulders, and 46.9% in the upper back (Felemban et al. 2021). Likewise, in a study conducted on medical 
students at a university in Brazil, it was found that 51% of university students have a prevalence of cervical pain, that 
is, pain in any of the structures of the neck, while 54.5% present low back pain (Morais et al. 2019). Similarly, a study

Abstract 
 
Arecanut, commonly known as betel nut, is a tropical crop that holds significant importance in India, ranks 
second both in consumption and production globally. The plant is exposed to disease threats to its fruits, leaves 
and roots, in its entire lifecycle. Currently the disease detection is based on observation, requires farmers to 
carefully inspect each crop regularly for crop illness. The objective of the present study is to propose a 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based advanced system to detect arecanut crop disease in leaves, trunk 
and fruit.  A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a powerful deep learning algorithm which is specifically 
designed for image analysis. It operates by processing input images, assigning learnable weights and biases to 
different elements within the images, and then learning from these patterns to differentiate healthy plants from 
diseased arecanut plants. To develop and evaluate the CNN model, it is intended to use datasets from published 
literature, which contains a diverse range of images depicting both healthy and diseased arecanut plant samples. 
The main objective of the system is to identify and detect diseases of plant more accurately but also to provide 
practical remedies and guidance to farmers, helping them to maintain healthy crops and increase productivity.

4.2. Proposed Improvements 
The present system developed based on small sample of dataset, the model is trained for detecting only 25 type of 
plant diseases. It is planned to train the system with more datasets of different plants and the diseases so that the 
scope of the system is expanded to other plants as well. In future the dataset can be used to build better models and 
improved in terms of accuracy by implementing advanced algorithms developed in future. The present work is based 
solely on data set collection and image scaling and detection of diseases. The system being a part of the project work 
may show some errors or have accuracy issues. The sample of datasets if very large, the system may take more time 
to process.  
CONCLUSION 
The present paper mainly focuses on the early detection of arecanut plant diseases like its leaves, trunk and fruit 
using CNN- Convolutional Neural Networks. The system works in steps- firstly pre-processing, feature extraction, 
training the model and then classification. As demonstrated by the system, it is capable of detecting diseases like 
Yellow Leaf, Mahali and Stem Bleeding in arecanut Plant, and also suggests remedies. The system may exhibit 
varied levels of detection accuracy, which totally depends on the stage of the disease and quality of input image.","Proceedings of the 3rd Indian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,

As shown in Figure 6, the model accuracy is about 88 percent.  The system provides information on preventive 
measures and corrective action to be taken. The CNN used here to help detect diseases, and the model was built 
using Tensor Flow and Keras Framework, implemented on Android/Linux. This proposed system is a small step 
towards encouraging farmers to adapt and practice smart farming, thus getting better yields and higher 
productivity. This system can be improved or more developed in future by using a drone with camera facility and 
cover large area and also expanded to other crops and make a drastic change in the agricultural sector

Abstract 
India, as a profuse agricultural country, needs advancement in the process of farming through technology. For that, 
we propose a technology called Wicked Moth Ousting Technology (WMOT). WMOT in Precision Farming using 
supervised Machine Learning (ML) can be an infallible solution for modern and sustainable agriculture. This paper 
proposed a well-trained, tested, and predicted model that will decrease the use of pesticides using a supervised ML 
algorithm and photographic phenomena. WMOT uses the photogrammetric method to create orthophotos. By 
checking the photographs using a supervised ML algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM), the proposed model will 
identify the infected plants and the automated nozzles will open only for that plant to spray from the unmanned air 
vehicle. This proposed way of farming will be economically beneficial and the use of fewer chemicals is also 
advantageous for human health and the ecosystem. It is a proposed work based on the prevention, of the attack of 
yellow stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) on the eastern part of Bardhaman district of West Bengal state, using 
pesticides precisely through the mentioned ML algorithm.

1. Introduction
India ranks second in the world in terms of producing rice. In India, around 44.6 million hectors of field are used to 
produce 87.8 million tons of rice. It is around 2.85 tons per hector.(Chatterjeeet al. 2014) The ratio between actual 
potential of the fields and the final production of paddy is low. Insects, which acts as the main cause of the potential 
decrees of paddy. Around 100 of insects can attack a paddy field and among those 20 pests are considered as major 
one to demolish a paddy field.(Cramer et al. 1967) In India only yellow stem borer (Scirpopagha incertulas) causes 
80% of damage.(Darro et al. 2023) Yellow stem borer is from Pyralidae (Lepidoptera) family. When a paddy field is 
attacked by yellow stem borer in vegetative stage, the symptom called dead heart and if the paddy field is attacked in 
reproductive stage produces white ear heads.(M. D. Pathak and Z. R. Khan 1994) For the sake of generating high ratio 
of yielding advancement in technology used in paddy farming is very much needed. Precision farming can be the 
solution of this. Using automation one can precisely use pesticides and herbicides according to the need. The reduced 
usage of pesticide and herbicides will help to maintain the cultivation more sustainable.  
1.1 Objectives  
Countries like India are totally dependent on the rice as their main resource for carbohydrates as a result India has to 
grow a humongous amount of paddy each year. India is the second largest rice producer in the world yet the pests and

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
This work only identifies the attack, symptoms of yellow stem borer , there are many pest and insects that can harm 
paddy, rice and many other crops. Insects like stalked-eyed flies, African rice gall midge, caseworm, rice hispa, 
spittlebugs, rice leaf folders, rice mealy bug , stink bug, rice bug, termite can cause Rice Yellow Mottle Virus 
(RYMV), rice blast, brown spot , sheath rot, leaf scald, false smut, grain rot and many more diseases.(Tatsushi et al., 
2009) Using binary classification we can’t classify all these at a time. Using multiclass classification SVM will be 
able to detect the infection and symptoms of different insects and pests. In multiclass classification the machine 
separates into three or more class to classify data.(Javaid et al.) 
 
6. Conclusion  
Production of paddy has always been a challenge due to the insects and pests specially the yellow stem borer which 
destroys most of the paddy production and this moth attacks in various stages of growth of paddy plant. The use of 
machine learning algorithms like SVM (Support Vector Machine) can help us differentiate between a yellow stem 
borer infected plant and a non-infected plant by doing binary classification. It helps us identifying which plant is in 
need of fertilizer so that a nozzle will open on that spot and only spray fertilizer on that area this way the amount of 
fertilizer needed for the field will reduce and the end product rice will be very little chemical mixes thus good for 
consuming.

Abstract 
The demand for STEM education has increased in the twenty-first century's technological era. Researchers' interest 
has increased in intention to study STEM research field. In order to analyze the development of this research field, 
this study will do a citation analysis of publications titled ""Intention to study STEM among youth"" that have been 
published in educational journals and are available on the Web of Science (WoS) database. We used the Web of Science 
database to conduct a bibliometric study of 122 papers on the topic ‘the intention to study STEM’ that were published 
in scholarly journals. VOSviewer was used in this study to assess and perform a bibliometric analysis. Annual trends, 
journals, publishers, research fields, publishing sources, organizations, keywords, categories, and researchers were all 
taken into account in statistical analyses of publications. The analysis revealed that: (1) Developed nations including 
the United States, Spain, Israel, and Germany accounted for the majority of STEM research intentions. (2) The three 
top most commonly appearing keywords for intention to study STEM literature were STEM, career choice, and gender. 
(3) Education and educational research were commonly linked to the intention to study STEM literature. The findings
support the inclusion of the intention to study STEM from larger geographical contexts and point to the necessity for
more multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary studies on this topic.
Keywords 
Intention to study STEM, Bibliometric Analysis, Review of research, and Career Choice 
1. Introduction
STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. These four areas are separate but related. STEM-
trained workers boost the economies of many nations by encouraging innovation, enhancing the standard of living, 
and boosting exports. (Li et al. 2021). The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2012) found 
that many countries have changed the focus of their educational policies to encourage more students—particularly 
those from underrepresented groups and bright young people—to chase careers in the STEM fields. The significance 
of STEM fields has motivated stakeholders, such as researchers, educators, and policymakers, to support students' 
fascination with and attainment with these fields. Similar efforts have been undertaken to develop laws and initiatives 
that would promote STEM perseverance in youngsters, especially those who are preparing for college and are close 
to finishing secondary school (Watt & Eccles 2008). In order to guide such policies and programs, it therefore seems 
critical to have an understanding of the factors that might be crucial in determining student persistence in STEM. 
Because different dynamics (such as new techniques, regulations, and programs) are continuously developing and 
may have varying effects on the STEM future of every country in the world (Sahin et al. 2018). The focus of this work 
is to assess the development of this research area by doing a bibliometric analysis of works published in educational 
journals on ""Intention to study STEM among youth”. Web of Science database will be used for the bibliometric 
analysis.  
Bibliometric analysis on the topic “intention to study STEM among youth” will have several advantages. Starting 
with, it will help to identify the trend in the development of published articles. Second, it helps in identifying the 
leading scientists working in the STEM field as well as the most popular places to find scientific articles.  For example, 
It highlights the authors and institutions that have published the most, as well as fresh research interests and potential 
research success, and identifies which institutions are more invested in this subject, and more (Mazloumian 2012). 
Finally, bibliometrics can help researchers locate academic researchers and institutions with which to interact, as well

5. Conclusion
By analyzing the WoS database, this study examined the annual trend in intention to study STEM and used 
bibliometric techniques to identify some aspects of intention to study STEM literature. This research was conducted 
using citation and keyword analysis of 122 publications that dealt with STEM study intentions and provided insightful 
information about the area. As per this study the number of intention to study STEM publications increased rapidly in 
recent years, because of the advancement of the STEM education and International Journal of Science Education is 
the most prolific publication source and a leader in publishing research on students' intentions to pursue STEM-related 
fields of study. As per this study majority of the research on this topic was done in developed nations like USA, Spain, 
Israel and Germany which shows that there is need for developing nation to investigate this field. Further this study 
highlighted that Florida international university and Gerhard sonnert are the most productive institution and authors. 
Most of the publications were published in education and educational research categories/ area and STEM, career 
choice and gender were the three top most frequently occurring keywords. As per this study Developmental 
Psychology, Journal of youth and adolescence, Social issues and policy review, Current directions in psychological 
science and Computers and education are the top 5 highest citations publication journal in intention to study STEM 
field. The results of this study can assist funding organizations and research governors in determining research policy 
in the area of intention to study STEM.

Abstract 
The paper presents the design and fabrication of a new rehabilitation device for increasing micro-circulation/skin blood 
flow(SBF) in diabetic foot. The device is capable of transmitting vibration stimulation perpendicular to the area of the 
foot with an improved mechanism of varying amplitude and frequency of vibration. This device is unique in the sense 
that it is also capable of regulating the amplitude of vibration, which makes it more effective in curing foot ulceration 
ailments of varying degree. Diabetes Mellitus is spreading at a fast pace and is estimated to double by the end of this 
decade. One of the severe consequences associated with this ailment is chronic foot ulceration which if left untreated/ill-
treated eventually leads to amputation of the limb. The medications available are not a favourable treatment for chronic 
conditions such as Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) as the side effects they cause can become more debilitating than the 
original pathology. The available vibration therapy devices till date, fail to produce desired curative results probably 
because of their distributed vibration and unregulated/uncontrolled vibration frequencies. This device not only induces 
controlled vibrations perpendicular to the foot with simultaneous amplitude and frequency modulation but is also cost 
effective.

1. Introduction
The most common causal pathway to diabetic foot ulceration involves the confluence of loss of sensation resulting in 
failure to detect repetitive pressure or trauma and abnormal foot structure or deformity producing sites of abnormally high 
pressure, usually over areas of bony prominence (Mueller et al. 1990 ; Brem et al.  2006). Persons with DM and signs of 
peripheral neuropathy have been shown to be 4 times as likely to have plantar ulcerations as those without neuropathy 
(Frykberg et al.  1998). Most treatment approaches involve non-prophylactic treatment with powerful medications such 
as antidepressants and anti-epileptics. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may also help but is expensive. These treatments are 
not favourable for chronic conditions such as DPN, as the side effects they cause can become more enfeebling than the 
original pathology.  
The blood micro-circulation is observed to be improved by vibration interventions with frequencies ranging from 20 to 
50Hz, and 50Hz vibration may result in a greater increase in skin blood flow(Lohman et al. 2007, 2011; Lythgo et al. 
2009). Furthermore, because of their reduced microvascular function, diabetics' SBF responses to vibration were less than 
those of healthy patients. Comprehending the situation, designing a device for providing vibrations, specifically for feet, 
with the required interventions is a great area to explore.  
Nakagami et al. applied vibration of frequency 47 Hz to the ears of mice which promoted ulcer healing due to increase in 
SBF(Nakagami et al.  2007). The works of Yu et al. (2017) , Lohman et al(2007,2011) and Lythgo et al (2009) further 
provided credibility to use of low magnitude and high frequency (<50 Hz) vibrations in improving skin blood glow in 
lower limbs(Yu et al.  2017;Lohman et al. 2007, 2011;Lythgo et al. 2009). While Yu et al. (2017) work was based on 
providing continuous vibration, both Lohman et al. (2007,2011)and Lythgo et al. (2009) made use of short term 
intermittent vibrations for improving blood cell velocity in leg. Independent studies show that interval training therapy is 
more effective as compared to continuous training therapy, which was in fact, found to have adverse effect in certain 
cases (Wisløff et al. 2007; Ribeiro et al. 2010; Mitranun et al. 2014;Nakagami et al. 2007).The study by Maloney-Hinds 
et al. made use of vibration interventions at 30 and 50 Hz. The vibration interventions were applied to the forearm of 
healthy adults for 10 mins and skin blood blow (SBF) was measured for 10s after 1 minute therapy each time. The results

Abstract 
The study aims to enhance the understanding of how Industry 4.0 enabler technologies can improve construction 
project management, which has been limited due to the industry's diverse processes. This study utilizes 6Ws’ 
systematic review design and protocol to develop a framework for digital construction management capabilities 
(DCM-Cs). In this research, a conceptual and systematic phase-wise implementation strategy is suggested to help and 
encourage the adoption of Industry 4.0 and modern technologies in construction project management. Nine enabler 
technologies and nine capabilities were integrated to develop nine propositions for project teams to enhance their 
current capabilities and create a framework for DCM-Cs. Academicians and practitioners in the project management 
industry have tried to develop their own DCM techniques, which are based on their own goals. As a result, significant 
future DCM developments demand a separate blueprint for each to optimise their DCM capabilities. Thus, by creating 
sub-frameworks, the presented implementation framework can be improved to best serve both academics and 
practitioners. The research provides a phase-wise implementation strategy and framework for DCMCs, integrating 
nine enabler technologies and capabilities. It enhances the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies in construction project 
management and provides insights into how enabler technologies can optimize and improve project management.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, involves digitizing products, processes, and organizations 
using digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, internet of things, robotics, additive 
manufacturing, and cyber physical systems. Construction project management involves dealing with a wide range of 
issues, such as cost control, quality control, scheduling, stakeholder management, risk assessment, procurement, scope 
control, resource management, and communication management  (Büyüközkan & Göçer 2018). Hence, is plagued by 
low productivity due to manual and unique processes. Construction industry is responding to Industry 4.0 by adopting 
Construction 4.0 (Muñoz-La Rivera et al. 2021), which aims to automate and digitize engineering, procurement, and 
construction processes to reduce costs, increase worker safety, and improve quality control. 
Technologies such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), building information modeling (BIM), AutoCAD, drones, 
analytics, and cloud solutions are driving the change in the Engineering, Procurement & Construction (EPC) business 
(Ding et al. 2019). However, the adoption of new digital trends and the level of digitization vary by industrial sector, 
and the construction industry faces challenges in identifying, appraising, and selecting digital technology due to one-
off designs and unique projects. The implementation of digital technologies in the construction industry is viewed as 
an enabler towards enhancing productivity, and governments of several countries are promoting the use of Industry 
4.0 technologies in the construction sector. The sector recognizes the significance of the digitalization trend, but

Abstract 
Energy planning and management is a requirement sustainable use of energy resources which are necessary social, 
economic or environment sustainability. There is need to balance electricity generation and consumption for safety, 
supply security and cost monument hence the need for effective modern energy models. Forecasting demand and 
planning for generation is one of the planning tools to ensure availability of accurate forecast and identifying 
management decisions.  Energy plan is an energy system analysis tool and methodologies suitable for the design and 
evaluation of smart energy and renewable energy system alternatives. This study presents the EnergyPLAN model 
and describe how to use it for the design of relevant alternatives. The is an energy system analysis tool that can be 
used for study and research in the design of future sustainable energy solutions with a special focus on energy systems 
with high shares of renewable energy sources. Traditionally disparate demand sectors, such as buildings, industry and 
transport, are linked with supply technologies through electricity, gas, district heating and cooling grids. In this way, 
EnergyPLAN enables the analysis of the conversion of renewable electricity into other energy carriers, such as heat, 
hydrogen, green gases and electrofuels, as well as the implementation of energy efficiency improvements and energy 
conservation. The structure of EnergyPLAN is discussed and the essential algorithms and computational structure. 
The EnergyPLAN can analyse coherent energy systems on an aggregated basis and with emphasis on evaluation of 
potential synergies across subsectors. EnergyPLAN evaluates hourly balances of district heating and cooling, 
electricity and gas grids involving technologies like heat pumps, cogeneration, electrolyzers, and electric vehicles, 
gasification, hydrogenation, and co-electrolyzers. The model is a freeware used in many countries globally.

393","Modellers can apply    Energy PLAN, to differentiate between a technical simulation, which ignores existing electricity 
market constructions and price levels, and a market-economic simulation, is adjustable using taxes. Energy PLAN can 
calculate the costs of the total system divided into fuel costs, investments costs, operation costs, CO2 costs and other 
taxes. Therefore, EnergyPLAN can generate data for further socio-economic feasibility studies, like balance of 
payment and job creation. 
 EnergyPLAN is an energy system analysis tool created for the study and research in the design of future sustainable 
energy solutions with a special focus on energy systems with high shares of renewable energy sources. It has been 
under development since 1999 and has formed the basis for a substantial number of PhD theses and several hundreds 
of research papers. EnergyPLAN is designed to exploit the synergies enabled from including the whole energy system, 
as expressed in the smart energy system concept. Thus, with EnergyPLAN, the user can take a holistic approach 
focusing on the analysis of the cross-sectoral interaction. Traditionally disparate demand sectors, such as buildings, 
industry and transport, are linked with supply technologies through electricity, gas, district heating and cooling grids. 
In this way, EnergyPLAN enables the analysis of the conversion of renewable electricity into other energy carriers, 
such as heat, hydrogen, green gases and electrofuels, as well as the implementation of energy efficiency improvements 
and energy conservation. This article describes the overall structure of EnergyPLAN and the essential algorithms and 
computational structure(Lund et al. 2021) 
2.1. Advantages of EnergyPLAN  
 As a freely available tool, it is easily downloaded with detailed documentation about its operation, which enable 
debate on its functionality and methodologies for improvement. 
 The main advantages of EnergyPLAN are; 
i.) 
Ability to model the entire system with all sectors related to the system  
ii.) 
The aggregation of units into representative units limiting the data requirement 
iii.) 
EnergyPLAN has ability to quickly simulate a user-defined scenario, 
iv.) 
High transparency in how scenarios are developed  
v.) 
The one hour (1h) temporal simulation step and the ability to simulate a whole year with seasonal 
variations. 
 
 Energy PLAN is continuously undergoing development to meet the future modelling requirements Currently, to future 
energy systems for example latest improvement is to on its ability to identify suitable flexible use of electrolysers and 
ability to handle different assumptions impact of variable renewable generation on the electricity market prices. 
Energy PLAN is particularly ideal option if the key objective to analyse impacts of  long-term alternatives, more so 
in relation  to renewable energy, for  distinct scenarios  analysis  without endogenous system optimisation. Energy 
PLAN can also be used in combination with other tools to take care of  additional objectives in an energy system 
analysis. Latest model development include developing its ability to identify suitable flexible use of electrolysers   and 
proper handling of  different assumptions on influence of variable renewable electricity productions on  electricity 
market prices(Lund et al. 2021).  
2.2. Limitations of Energy-PLAN  
 The model has some inherent limitations worth noting too. Energy-PLAN focuses on the entire system and the 
aggregation employed cannot capture detailed operation of individual units in the energy system. Additionally its  
exogenous and transparent system design and its  fast computational time comes at the expense of larger requirements 
of the user which requires experience to identify favourable scenarios for analysis(Lund et al. 2021). 
3. Conclusion 
Energy management a very important function for world to achieve economic prosperity and environmental security. 
EnergyPLAN is a freeware that can support independent add-ons and help tools and it and can be executed from other 
platforms like Excel or MATLAB, thus enabling multi-execution. Energy-PLAN can compute hourly operation for 
an energy system which enables reliable matching of demand and supply even with introduction of intermittent and

systems on an hourly basis, capturing heating, cooling, electricity, industry, and transport sectors. The model was 
developed and is maintained by the Sustainable Energy Planning Research Group at Aalborg University, in Denmark. 
The users of Energy-PLAN include    researchers, policy makers, and consultancies, worldwide. The model is widely 
used and accessible due to the key focus on free sharing the model during its development making it to have user-
friendly interface. The Energy-PLAN model has been used in many studies, reports, and hundreds of scientific 
publications.  
 Energy-PLAN is limited to some extent in that it focuses on the entire energy system and with the aggregation 
employed, it is not possible to carry out a detailed analysis of the operation of individual units. Additionally, the 
exogenous and transparent system design which leads to fast computational time comes at the expense of larger 
requirements of the user hence, some; experience is required to identify favourable scenarios. 
The appropriateness of Energy -PLAN depends on the individual user’s objectives, but EnergyP-LAN is particularly 
suitable when the main objective is to analyse the impact of long-term alternatives, especially with relation to 
renewable energy, and specific scenarios are analysed without endogenous system optimisation. Energy plan can be 
used in combination with other tools for additional objectives when undertaking an energy system analysis.

Abstract 
The overall objective of this research is to identify both current and future technologies, strategies, policy, and other 
measures necessary to transition the electricity and heat energy sector towards reduced greenhouse gas emissions and 
limit temperature rise to the target 1.5oC rise above the preindustrial level.   The greatest sustainability challenge 
facing humanity today is the greenhouse gas emissions and the global climate change with fossil fuels led by coal, 
natural gas and oil contributing 61.3% of global electricity generation in the year 2020. The cumulative effect of the 
Stockholm, Rio, and Johannesburg conferences identified sustainable energy development (SED) as a very important 
factor in the sustainable global development.   This study reviews energy transition strategies and proposes a roadmap 
for sustainable energy transition for sustainable electricity generation and supply in line with commitments of the 
Paris Agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperature to 
1.5oC above the preindustrial level. The sustainable transition strategies typically consist of three major technological 
changes namely, energy savings on the demand side, generation efficiency at production level and fossil fuel 
substitution by various renewable energy sources and low carbon nuclear.  
For the transition remain technically and economically feasible and beneficial, policy initiatives are necessary to steer 
the global electricity transition towards a sustainable energy and electricity system. Large-scale renewable energy 
adoption should include measures to improve efficiency of existing nonrenewable sources which still have an 
important cost reduction and stabilization role.  A resilient grid with advanced energy storage for storage and 
absorption of variable renewables should also be part of the transition strategies. From this study, it was noted that 
whereas sustainable development has social, economic, and environmental pillars, energy sustainability is best 
analysed by five-dimensional approach consisting of environmental, economic, social, technical, and 
institutional/political sustainability to determine resource sustainability. The energy transition requires new 
technology for maximum use of the abundant but intermittent renewable sources a sustainable mix with limited 
nonrenewable sources optimized to minimize cost and environmental impact but maintained quality, stability, and 
flexibility of an electricity supply system. Technologies needed for the transition are those that   use conventional 
mitigation, negative emissions technologies which capture and sequester carbon emissions and finally technologies 
which alter the global atmospheric radiative energy budget to stabilize and reduce global average temperature. A 
sustainable electricity system needs facilitating technology, policy, strategies and infrastructure like smart grids, and 
models with an appropriate mix of both renewable and low carbon energy sources.

Abstract 
Global energy is a very significant energy with demand gradually increasing making it a key solution to tackle global 
greenhouse gas emissions and global temperature rise. Production technologies for hydrogen are commercially 
available, while some are still under development. In hydrogen is a renewable secondary energy source, and feedstock, 
and tool to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets and promote economic decarbonization. The unique properties of 
hydrogen make it a powerful enabler for energy transition, benefiting the energy system and end-use applications. 
Hydrogen gas has significant potential to play an important role in decarbonizing hard-to-electrify sectors of the 
economy, like long distance trucks in transport, aviation, and heavy manufacturing industries besides providing. 
Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies will enable this transition to a clean, low-carbon energy system resulting in greatly 
reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. Green hydrogen energy provides clean energy, and the 
comprehensive utilization of hydrogen energy is crucial for the low-carbon transformation of the power sector. The 
production of hydrogen through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy reduces carbon emissions although 
it leads to an increase in demand for renewable energy generators. Appropriate planning of hydrogen storage can 
reduce the overall investment cost and promote a low carbon transition of the power system. Since hydrogen is a 
highly flammable fuel, to ensure safe operation and to timely detect a leakage, reliable safety sensors are applied. 
Indoor use of hydrogen detectors is recommended for indoor fueling operations. There are safety sensors on the market 
that can be used for the successful deployment of hydrogen technology. For hydrogen to take its rightful place in the 
energy transition, as with other energy technologies is sufficient development of the technology itself. Most hydrogen 
today is produced by steam reforming of natural gas, but green hydrogen can be manufactured by electrolysis using 
renewable electricity and use of renewable feedstock like biomethane.

Introduction 
195 countries signed a legally binding agreement on December 12, 2015: at Paris, to keep global warming well below 
2°C which requires countries’ globally to decarbonize world’s energy system. This energy transition faces 
challenges.as significant renewable energy must be installed and integrated, while securing the supply and resilience 
of the power system is demanding(Hydrogen Council 2017). Among potential renewable energies identified for the 
transition, hydrogen is a versatile, clean, and safe energy carrier that can be used as fuel for power generation or in 
industry as feedstock for production of various chemicals and products. Gren hydrogen can be produced from 
renewable electricity and from carbon-abated fossil fuels. Hydrogen is  emissions free at the  point of use, can be can 
be stored and transported at high energy density in liquid or gaseous form for various applications including energy 
storage in fuel cells to generate heat and electricity or a transport fuel(Hydrogen Council  2017).  Hydrogen is among 
the most important low-carbon technologies more so with the introduction of carbon peaking and carbon neutral 
targets, and enforcement of policies that promote hydrogen energy technology(Ran et al. 2022). The application of

Abstract 
Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as ais a viable mitigation strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions in fossil-fuel power plants. Although CCS technology can mitigate the anthropogenic GHG emissions, the 
technologies are associated with additional water requirements for chemical and physical processes to capture and 
separate CO2 and other environmental impacts like introduction of parasitic loads imposed by carbon capture on 
power plants hence reduced efficiency and more cooling requirements and groundwater contamination due to CO2 
leakage during geologic sequestration. The energy transition requires the decarbonizing of the power, transport, and 
industry sectors. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies will play 
a major role in this energy transition by cutting down emissions from new fossil fuel power plants. Main challenges 
facing the CCS and CCU include low oil price to make CO2-enhanced oil recovery profitable, lack of financial 
incentives for CO2 geological storage, limited acceptance, lack facilitating government policy and CCS regulations, 
and high capital investment.

Introduction 
Greenhouse gas emission (GHG)from anthropogenic activities are the most important environmental issues of the 
twenty-first century. This has made the CCS (carbon capture and storage) and carbon capture and use (CCU) important 
technologies and approaches particularly in power generation and industrial operations to cut down emissions released 
to the atmosphere. CCS (carbon capture and storage) is a  means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by capturing 
and subsequently storing CO2., while CCU (carbon capture and utilization) is a way of recycling  carbon in the 
captured CO2 by converting it into products like  fuels, chemicals, or other products(Lerche Raadal & Saur Modahl, 
2022). The climate change resulting from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is one of the most 
significant long term environmental challenges today. The greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the electricity sector 
have been growing to ever increasing electricity demands and while fossil fuels remain the dominant source for 
electricity generation. There are various mitigation strategies developed aimed at reducing CO2 emissions with 
technological alternatives for to reduce emissions from power plants to the atmosphere being. 
i.) 
 Switching to less carbon-intensive fuels, e.g., natural gas instead of coal. 
ii.) 
 Increasing the use of renewable energy sources or low carbon nuclear energy, which emit less or no net 
CO2; and  
iii.) 
Capturing and sequestrating carbon emissions. 
The CCS is a promising approach for reduction of GHG emissions by capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) at the point of 
power generation and transporting to an injection site, and sequestrating for long-term storage in suitable formations. 
A  CCS unit at thermal  plants can efficiently capture about 85–95% of the CO2 processed in a capture plant(Eldardiry 
& Habib  2018).

limited by lack of knowledge on long term implications to the oceans in terms of acidity and marine species. 
CO2  captured can also be used  directly industrial sectors, like  food and beverage , pharmaceutical industry as well 
as  conversion  into high-demand products such as urea, methanol and biofuels(Moses  Kabeyi & Oludolapo 
Olanrewaju, 2022b; M. J. B. Kabeyi & O. A. Olanrewaju, 2022a). 
 CCS focuses on improving the results for one indicator only and CCU represents a multi-functional system. It is 
therefore crucial to analyze the use of more than one indicator and to establish relevant system boundaries when 
comparing the environmental performance of CCS and CCU systems. By applying system expansion, the compared 
systems provide the same functions to society with the analysis demonstrating that CCS is more beneficial over CCU 
if fossil electricity are part of the grid mix. However, if renewable electricity used for substitution is decided nis not 
included in the system expansion boundaries, CCU offers the best option. Hence the choice of the modelling decision 
is an important issue when comparing multifunctional systems. As the society moves  towards a circular economy, 
there will be an increased focus on the ranking of the environmental performance of use, reuse and recycling of our 
common goods and resources, with  LCA methodology playing an important role as a  tool for this purpose, and that 
the expansion of the system boundaries will be crucial for the correct assessment of the systems(Moses Jeremiah 
Barasa Kabeyi & Oludolapo Akanni Olanrewaju, 2021; Lerche Raadal & Saur Modahl, 2022). 
 Comparisons between CCS and CCU should be used as a guide only since inconsistencies in the system boundaries 
and functional units make it difficult to compare them on an equivalent basis. Therefore  specific guidelines or ‘product 
category rules’ are needed for  application of the LCA methodology to CCS and CCU technologies. Very important 
are the guidelines on the definition of the system boundaries and functional units should be established for different 
systems(Lerche Raadal & Saur Modahl, 2022; Masanet et al., 2013).  
Conclusions  
Both CCS and CCU technologies seek to mitigate climate change, but are regarded as temporary solutions, especially 
options which merely delay the emissions of CO2 instead of eliminating them permanently. The CCU appears a  better 
option than CCS since CCU is  unprofitable activity, but the  cost-effectiveness and  the environmental impacts of 
CCU need to be carefully evaluated on a life cycle basis to ensure a positive economic and environmental balance. 
The global demand of chemicals and other products cannot provide enough capacity to capture CO2 emissions to 
contribute to effectively contribute to the carbon reduction targets. Another significant challenge with CCU is that the 
‘storage’ time of CO2 which is limited by short lifespans of the chemicals and fuels produced. Therefore, there’re is 
need focus research on the development of materials and products having longer lifetimes to facilitate long term 
storage of CO2. Although CCS overcomes this challenge through long-term storage, CO2 leakage is a prevailing risk 
that can potentially cause more damage. Also significant is the fact that deployment of large-scale CCS may come too 
late to reverse the impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, if the above concerns can be addressed, both CCS and 
CCU could play a role in mitigating climate change, together with other options such as energy demand reduction, 
renewables, and other low-carbon technologies. 
 
The Life cycle assessment studies established that CCS could reduce the global warming potential (GWP) from power 
plants by 63–82%, with greatest reductio in oxy-fuel combustion in pulverized coal and integrated gasification 
combined cycle (IGCC) plants. The lowest reduction is achieved by post-combustion capture in combined cycle gas 
turbine (CCGT) plants. Environmental impacts like acidification and human toxicity for CCS, while for CCU, the 
GWP varies widely based on utilization option. Mineral carbonation may reduce the GWP by 4–48% compared to the 
no CCU. By using CO2 for production of chemicals, like dimethylcarbonate (DMC), the GWP can be reduced by 4.3 
times and ozone layer depletion by 13 times when compared to conventional DMC process. The Enhanced oil recovery 
yields GWP 2.3 times lower compared to discharging CO2 to the atmosphere but leads to higher acidification by three 
times. Capturing CO2 by microalgae to produce biodiesel leads to 2.5 times higher GWP compared with fossil diesel, 
while other environmental impacts are significantly higher. On average basis, the GWP of CCS is significantly lower 
compared to CCU options, but has other environmental impacts being higher compared to CCU except for DMC 
production which is the worst CCU option overall.

Abstract 
For women in leadership, managing work and life is quintessential, especially when leading in male dominated 
occupations such as STEM. Many women seeking career advancement successfully manage multifaceted roles but 
they still continue to face hurdles to reach senior leadership positions.This study examined factors like social support 
and work-family enrichment/conflict to determine how women HOD’s in all the engineering colleges of Delhi coped 
with it. By surveying STEM women leaders, this research explored work-life strategies and support resources used by 
them to balance their work and non-work domains. Structure equation modelling had been used to determine the 
factors responsible for women being in the lower level of heirarchy and futhur the structural relationships have been 
supported by interviews of 35 women HOD’s analysed with Nvivo.The results revealed difficulty in between work 
and personal roles and recognized informational and emotional support as most significant to their roles as leaders. 
Findings also indicated that most support came from motivation by family and having a social life outside the 
organization, respectively.

Abstract 
The concept of sustainability has received much attention globally because of its multidisciplinary nature and future 
goal which is sustainable development. The concept relies on three basic pillars of the economy, environment, and 
society. Sustainable energy has two additional pillars of technology and institutional pillars. Sustainable energy 
systems refer to systems that can meet present demands by maintaining an adequate balance between the economy, 
environment, and society, while ensuring that the energy resources do not get depleted and remain available for future 
use. This study identified sustainability indicators for energy sources. The various sources of energy were assessed 
for sustainability based on indicators like price of power generated, lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, resource 
availability, conversion efficiency, land requirements, social impacts, and water consumption. In the assessment, 
indicators were assumed to have equal importance to sustainable development and were equally important in ranking 
energy sources based on their sustainability. The study demonstrated that renewable energy resources are more 
sustainable technologies with wind power stations having the highest rank in sustainability followed by nuclear, hydro, 
and solar. Wind was ranked the most sustainable followed by hydropower, photovoltaics and then geothermal while 
coal was the least sustainable.  Coal and nuclear are the most favorable based on price of electricity produced but 
based on average prices, geothermal and hydro have the lowest possible prices and hence most favorable. Among 
renewable sources, photovoltaics has the highest average and overall cost of generation, although it remains cheaper 
than gas and coal at the lowest limit. On electrical efficiency, hydropower has the highest efficiency while 
photovoltaics has the lowest electrical efficiency. Greenhouse gas emissions were low in all non-fossil fuels, with 
Wind, hydro and nuclear have lowest values of greenhouse gas emissions while coal has the highest greenhouse gas 
emissions.

Introduction 
Although energy is essential to economic, social development and improved quality of life, most of the energy is 
currently produced and used in ways that are not sustainable. To assess progress towards a sustainable energy future, 
energy indicators that can measure and monitor important changes will be needed. The supply of reliable, and adequate 
energy products and services at an affordable cost, and in a s secure and environmentally friendly manner and energy 
that conforms with socioeconomic development needs of the people, is essential for sustainable development. This is 
because energy is necessary input for eradication of poverty, improving human welfare and to raise peoples living 
standards(M J B Kabeyi & A O Olanrewaju, 2023; M. J. B. Kabeyi & O. A. Olanrewaju 2023b). The concept of 
sustainability relies on three basic pillars: i.e.  economy, environment, and society. For sustainable energy systems, it 
is a system that can meet present demands by maintaining an adequate balance between economy, environment, and 
society, without depleting the energy resources for future use.  
Energy system sustainability assessment requires several indicators from the five dimensions. One popular method 
used to evaluate energy sustainability is the multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. This study presents an 
overview of the indicators used to assess energy system sustainability (Khan  2021). The need exists to identify and 
quantify sustainability indicators that may be    site-specific and from several sources and sometimes are barely

495","6. Conclusion  
 Sustainable energy is a very important element of sustainable development through provision of uninterrupted clean 
electricity to consumers. The demand for electricity is continuously increasing due to growth in world population 
industrialization, electrification, and technological developments. It is necessary to meet the increasing electricity 
demand for sustainable development, by using the consumable resources of the world in the most productive manner 
and minimum level to minimize the negative impacts on human health and environment.  
 
The concept of sustainability has received significant attention globally because of its multidisciplinary nature and 
interest in sustainable development. Sustainable development and sustainability mainly rely on the three basic pillars, 
namely economy, environment, and society. Sustainable energy systems should meet present demands by maintaining 
an adequate balance between economy, environment, and society, while remaining non depletable and thus ensuring 
future use. Indicators are needed in the assessment of energy sustainability from the 5 dimensions of sustainable 
energy. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a popular way for evaluating the sustainability of energy systems.  
This study has demonstrated that renewable energy resources are more sustainable technologies compared with fossil 
fuel energy sources. Wind generation, nuclear, hydro, and solar power generation rank the highest in sustainability. 
Wind was ranked the most sustainable followed by hydropower, photovoltaics and then geothermal while coal 
produced power was the least sustainable.  Coal and nuclear are the most favorable based on price of electricity 
produced but based on average prices, geothermal and hydro have the lowest possible prices and hence most favorable. 
Among renewable sources, photovoltaics has the highest average and overall highest cost of generation, although it 
remains cheaper than gas and coal at the lowest limit. On electrical efficiency, hydropower has the highest efficiency 
while photovoltaics has the lowest electrical efficiency. Greenhouse gas emissions were low in all non-fossil fuels, 
with Wind, hydro and nuclear have lowest values of greenhouse gas emissions while coal has the highest greenhouse 
gas emissions.

Abstract 
This study reviewed and classified energy-emission-related IDA studies from 2016-2020 and assessed the relationship 
between the energy intensity of China and energy-emission-related IDA studies on China. Also, the study decomposed 
changes in China’s industrial sector’s energy consumption and emissions for 2016-2020 into contributing factors using 
Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI). Findings show that of the three hundred and fifty-one energy-emission-
related IDA studies, 66% of them were on China and the energy intensity of China decreased as energy-emission-
related IDA studies on China increased with time within the study period indicating that research outcomes and 
recommendations were considered by policymakers. For the additive LMDI decomposition,  results revealed that there 
was a decrease in energy consumption occasioned majorly by energy intensity followed by energy structure. Also, 
results showed that the increase in emissions was caused predominantly by the carbon emission factor, followed by 
overall industrial activity. Though the decrease in industrial energy consumption indicates the application of research 
outcomes and engagement of energy-efficient technologies, there is still need for more environmentally friendly 
policies. The innovation in this study is the assessment of the impact of energy-emission-related IDA studies in China 
on energy intensity, industrial energy consumption, and emissions in China.

1. Introduction
One of the challenges faced by the world for many years is climate change, which is one of the consequences of 
excessive energy consumption. Extreme energy demand is challenging as the continuous increase in energy demand 
results in an ever-widening gap between energy demand and supply. This leaves researchers, practitioners, and 
policymakers with no other option than to seek ways to reduce energy consumption and emissions. Hence, countries 
have seen the need to reduce energy usage and CO2 emissions (Inglesi-Lotz & Pouris, 2012). The reduction and 
eventually the elimination of incessant rises in energy consumption and emissions have been identified as the way to 
ensure sustainable economic development (Bekun, Emir, & Sarkodie, 2019), (Oladiran & Meyer  2007; Pollet;,

policies that support the use of non-fossil fuel, payment of carbon tax and invest more in IDA emissions studies on 
China, its sectors and regions while effectively implementing the recommendations from .  
 
6. Conclusions 
In this study, over three hundred and fifty (350) energy-emission-related IDA studies for the period 2016-2020 were 
reviewed and classified. More than a decade before the study period, focus was increasingly on emission studies and 
pollutants, particularly with the aid of LMDI. About 75% of the studies were on emission and the focus on emission 
increased rapidly, perhaps due to the increased global attention on CO2 emission reduction and efforts to achieve Paris 
Agreement targets by 2030. As a result, there is increased attention specifically on prospective studies of emissions, 
energy efficiency, de-coupling of economic growth from emissions and the decomposition of de-coupling efforts using 
the LMDI-based hybrid method to ensure more exposition of the future.   
 
China is the most studied country with respect to energy-emission-related IDA studies. Reviewed studies could not 
tell whether China will achieve emissions targets on or before 2030. The good news, however, is that at various levels, 
sectors, regions, provinces, and cities, the most-intense energy-emission-related IDA research ever are ongoing in 
China, the world’s highest CO2 emitter. As a result, the impact of the energy-emission-related IDA studies  on energy 
intensity of China was examined. The results showed that energy-emission-related IDA studies of China have a 
positive correlation with energy intensity of China over the study period. This suggested that policymakers in China 
are taking into consideration the findings from the researchers for better policy analyses and development. The additive 
and multiplicative LMDI calculations of change in China’s industrial energy and its determinants show that there is 
decrease in industrial energy consumption in China over the study period caused by intensity effect and structural 
effect which proposes that investment on energy-emission-related IDA studies in China are yielding dividends. It also 
proposes that China is engaging energy-efficient technologies and policies. LMDI computations for both additive and 
multiplication forms revealed that carbon emission factor, followed by overall industrial activity are the key factors 
responsible for increase in emission. Specifically, for additive form of LMDI, carbon emission effect and industrial 
activity effect; while for multiplicative form of LMDI, carbon emission factor in [2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2014-2019 
and 2017-2018], as well as overall activity effect in [2014-2015 & 2018-2019] are the highest contributors to increase 
in emission. The above reducing and increasing agents of China’s industrial emission were partly consistent  with the 
findings of Shi, Han, Zafar, and Wei (2019) and Xie, Shao, and Lin (2016). Although, there were indications that 
policy recommendations from energy-emissions-related IDA researchers were implemented, China’s industrial 
emissions increased as energy-emissions-related IDA studies increased over the studies period. Hence, China needs 
to make further investment on IDA emission studies with the view to seek options to mitigate emissions, achieve peak 
carbon emission before 2030, as planned.

Introduction 
Due to heightened rivalry, more demanding customers, and the frequently uncertain economic 
climate in many countries, the external environment that impacts organisations is constantly 
changing. Running operations at the lowest cost, with greater dependability and speed, and with 
a better ability to adapt and constantly improve are some of the pillars in the development of 
operations strategy in organisations that aim to flourish in this competitive environment.  
E-commerce is one of the most important components of all businesses/industries because it
enables them to contact more customers and give them more ease. By doing away with the
requirement for real stores and sales personnel, it also enables an organisation to lower expenses
and boost efficiency. In addition, it can be used in a manner to gather information about their
clients, which will help them better understand their wants and preferences and design
experiences that are tailored to them. Customers can buy products online, frequently swiftly and
easily, with the additional convenience of free shipping and returns. It was created to help
companies function more cost- and efficiently.

Abstract 
The manufacturing industry need to be more conscious of how its impact the environment. The manufacturing 
companies are to blame for global warming because of their waste generation, depletion of natural resources, and 
disruption of the ecosystem. Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is a concept introduced to help reduce 
environmental issues caused by industries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of Green Supply 
Chain Management (GSCM) in the manufacturing industry in South Africa. Data was collected from employees 
working in various manufacturing companies, from management level to lower levels. A descriptive research method 
was adopted to evaluate the implementation of GSCM, in terms of identifying the suitable practices, the right 
approach, the value added as well as the benefits and challenges of implementation. It was found that the 
manufacturing industry is indeed aware if its impact on the environmental and have put measures in place to reduce 
this impact, such as adopting GSCM.  This study identified the suitable GSCM practices that can be adopted to reduce 
environmental impact in the manufacturing industry as well as identify the approach to implementing the GSCM 
practices.

1. Introduction
Environmental issues are accelerating rapidly all around the world. Conserve Energy Future defines environmental 
issues as problems developed due to human mistreatment towards the plant’s system. Woo (2020) stated the three 
main environmental issues faced in South Africa as ‘’pollution, lack of energy, and deforestation’ ’Pollution is process 
of taking out harmful materials in the environment, the harmful materials are named pollutants (National Geographic 
Society 2011). These pollutants destroy the water, land and even the quality of air. The second issue faced is lack of 
energy, Woo (2020) further mentions that South Africa depends on coals as 77% of the produced energy is through 
coals. The lack of energy is caused by the reliance of the current source of energy. Coals are a source energy that gets 
to be released into the air when used, causing environmental problems. The third issue mentioned by Woo (2020), is 
deforestation which refers to the removal and cutting of forest, deforestation can birth other major issues as such 
pollution from the use of machines and chemicals used when cutting down trees. This process can lead to the decrease 
in oxygen provided to the plants and animals. 
The South African manufacturing industry comprises three sectors: food and beverages, chemical products, and metal 
and machinery (Statistics South Africa 2014). This industry produces more products during its manufacturing process 
than other industries to meet customer demands. The manufacturing industry need to be more aware of how its 
processes impact the environment. Shaharudin et al. (2017) mentioned that manufacturing companies are to blame for 
global warming because of their waste generation, depletion of natural resources, and disruption of the ecosystem. 
Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is a concept introduced to help reduce environmental issues caused by 
industries (Khan, 2018). Khan, (2018) further mentioned that the main goal of GSCM is to decrease pollution (air, 
water and waste) while at the same time enhancing the firms’ performance in reusing and recycling products. GSCM 
integrates Supply Chain Management and objectives of environmental protection to increase the supply chain 
profitability and market share while decreasing ecological risks and inefficiencies (Aslam  2018). Environmental

538","It is indicated that significant number of respondents did not know/not sure of any increased profitability and savings 
since the implementation of GSCM in their company, this is a concern because it can either indicates that other benefits 
of GSCM may not be communicated or indicate that there is no advantage in terms of increased profitability and 
savings hence most of the respondents do not know/not sure.  
 
7. Conclusion 
It was found that companies in the manufacturing industry are aware of their impact to the environmental issues and 
have taken measures to reduce the impact. Implementing GSCM is one way of reducing this impact, practices such as 
green design, green manufacturing, green logistics and packaging were found to be the most GSCM practices 
companies were most familiar with. This study revealed employees’ views on the practices that they feel need to be 
prioritized in the manufacturing industry, the most common practice mentioned among the respondents was green 
manufacturing. An approach taken to implement GSCM in the industry was identified, there are different approaches 
mentioned, however the most common was strategic planning, this was the most popular ‘’first step of 
implementation’’.  
 
The value of GSCM in the manufacturing industry was uncovered by this study. It was found that GSCM add value 
by allowing compliance to environmental regulations enhancing environmental and operation performance and 
contribute to a good company reputation. Apart from the value of GSCM, benefits of GSCM were also identified as 
company growth, competitive advantage, green image among others.

Abstract 
The purpose of the study was to evaluate the optimisation of cutting and snapping of float glass operation. It is essential 
for any manufacturing industry to optimise their processes to increase productivity and compete in this ever changing 
manufacturing environment. This is a case study of glass manufacturing in South Africa, the leading manufacturer of 
float glass in South Africa. Questionnaire was designed to collect primary data and an experiment was conducted to 
collect secondary data. This design was preferred and allowed the researcher to collect easily onsite. Both quantitative 
and qualitative research was used in this study to explore and examine different variables linked to the cutting and 
snapping process at the company. The results revealed that the variables with the most impact on the cutting and 
snapping operation at the company as well as the ranges at which these variables should be set to achieve optimum 
cutting and snapping operation in float glass manufacturing. The relationship between these variables were also 
examine. However, the extent to which they are interlinked should be further studied. The study findings led to the 
conclusion that to optimize cutting and snapping the following variables must be considered. The cutting wheel must 
not be worn and must have not run more than 15km, temperature must be 59 to 60 at cutting and the ribbon must be 
stable. These variables must be continuously monitored and should be adjusted as outside conditions drastically 
change.

1. Introduction
The company where the study was followed is a leading manufacturer of float glass in South Africa. The company 
specializes in float glass and manufactures laminated glass commonly used for shop fronts, mirrors for both industrial 
and household, and sealant products. The company produces around 260 000 tons of high quality float glass each year. 
These products are supplied to customers across the country as well as abroad from the head office in springs. The 
company float glass is branded Clearview while laminated products are branded intruder proof and mirror products 
are branded images.  The company is a division of the PG group and manufactures both building glass and automotive 
glass. The company has two float lines one for building glass and one for automotive glass. Both plants are capable 
of manufacturing building and automotive glass. As a part of the PG Group, the company is a R2.5billion 
(US$300million) a year organisation which employs 3 000 people at several factories and has some 200 outlets and 
warehouses around the world. Exports account for a significant portion of the Group’s revenue. Through their 
Corporate Social Investment programme, they contribute towards the uplifting and sustaining the communities in 
which they operate. Float glass manufacturing operation can be divided into 5 major stages which are raw material 
mixture, furnace (heating and melting raw materials at 1600 degree Celsius), Bath (glass forming into thickness and 
width), Lehr (glass annealing) and glass cutting and snapping where glass is cut into sizes as per customer requirement. 
Optimising the operation of glass cutting and snapping must be done in stages or sequence as one stage affects the 
other. There are many variables within each stage that results in poor cutting and snapping yield over time. These 
variables are linked and all directly and indirectly results in cutting and snapping scrap.  
Float Glass making process is a long automated process which requires a lot of manual inputs and is easily affected 
by a lot of variables such as ambient temperature, quality of cutting tools, glass strain and cooling temperatures. 
Cutting and snapping losses are in the top three of overall losses incurred by the process. Cutting and snapping losses 
are on the rise and the reasons for this are currently unknown.

550","Figure 21.  lehr entry and temperature at cutting 
 
From the trials conducted it is evident that the lower the glass temperature at the entry of the lehr where glass cooling 
starts the lower the temperature at the end of the cooling process which becomes even lower at cutting area as it is 
exposed to ambient temperature. Trial one and five results show a lehr entry temperature of 593 and temperature at 
cutting 50°C and 51°C respectively. At 50°C plates rejected as results of lower temperature were high. Trial 3 and 4 
were conducted on the same day one in the morning and the other in the afternoon.   
 
6. Conclusion 
The objective of the study was to optimise the glass cutting and snapping operation by reducing losses and scrap 
related to cutting and snapping and identify the best combination of settings for all variables involved in cutting and 
snapping. To optimise the operation of cutting and snapping in float glass reduce waste associated with it one needs 
to understand what influences and causes cutting and snapping in the first place. The study identified three main 
variables that cause cutting and snapping and the defects created when those variables are out of normal range. The 
study identifies cutting equipment (worn cutting wheel) glass temperature (strain) and unstable ribbon as a result of 
product changes as the main contributors to poor cutting and snapping.  To optimize cutting and snapping and reduce 
defects the cutting wheel must not be worn, temperature must be 59 to 60 at cutting and the ribbon must be stable. 
The process controllers should always strive to have these variables within targets and continuously monitor them and 
compensate as outside conditions changes. The objective of the study was met however an in depth understanding of 
these variables together as a unit needs to be further studied assuming the worst conditions as well as normal conditions 
to understand how they interlink. This will give guidelines to process controllers on how to compensate during the 
worst conditions.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate how the cost of quality affects the defense sector in South Africa. The high 
cost of poor quality is one of the reasons why South Africa's military industry's profits and exports are decreasing. 
Costs of poor quality (COPQ) affects production efficiency and profitability to customer satisfaction and public 
reputation. To assess the impact of the cost of poor quality on a company's productivity, profitability, and customer 
satisfaction, the interview questions were created and distributed to four different military firms to collect data that 
would allow the researcher to assess the COPQ's influence on each company's productivity. The interview also assisted 
the researcher in documenting the primary or common causes and effects of poor quality in the defense sector, allowing 
the author to effectively suggest a strategy to reduce the sources of poor-quality costs in military businesses. To 
identify and categorize internal and external failure costs from various defense organizations as well as to establish a 
method for evaluating the cost of poor quality to estimate the impact on an organization, the data entry forms in table 
1 to table 4 below were created to record all the poor-quality costs incurred in 2020 that were recorded in each 
company's database. This helps the researcher calculate the cost of poor quality in 2020 for each company and 
determine the impact on the company's profitability. The outcomes of the research indicate that the cost of poor quality 
influences the defense industry’s profitability, productivity, and customer satisfaction. According to the research, a 
company’s productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction can increase if the cost of poor-quality decreases.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the defense industry has placed a strong emphasis on marketing and operations management, and they 
are unconcerned about the high cost of poor quality, which has a significant influence on an organization. To survive 
and thrive in today's competitive environment, every business must prioritize quality. Customer satisfaction and 
beyond is a major endeavor in strategy makers' objectives. To overcome these problems, is critical to aim for greater 
quality product at a minimum cost (Mantri &Juju 2015). 
According to SA committee on defense, the Defense Industries have a significant economic influence on South Africa. 
The Maritime, Aerospace and Defense Industries Association compared South African Defense Industry numbers for 
2019/20 to those from 2016/17. Revenue decreased by R7 billion, from R19.5 billion to R12.5 billion; exports 
decreased by nearly 50%, from R12 billion to R6.5 billion; and R&D investment decreased from R1.7 billion to R6.5 
billion (pmg.org.za, n.d.).  
High Poor quality cost is one of the challenges that some of South African defense industries are facing and is 
influencing organizations productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is directly linked 
to quality. According to (Biadacz, 2020). Customers who are pleased with an organization's service and product will 
give it a higher rating in reviews than those that do not provide high-quality goods or services. 
The high cost of poor quality is one of the reasons why South Africa's military industry's profits and exports are 
decreasing. Costs of poor quality (COPQ) affects production efficiency and profitability to customer satisfaction and 
public reputation. (pmg.org.za, n.d.).

and the average Costs of defects discovered after shipment or handover to the customer contributed an average cost 
of R     1,039,003, while remaining defects discovered prior to shipment or handover to the customer contributed an 
average cost of R810 230 The costs involved in service to customers under warranty contracts contributed more to 
the failure cost of R   11,422,592. 
 
 
Figure 4. SAAB COPQ Pareto analysis 
As a result, it can be concluded that in Denel, warranty charges contributed more to the failure cost in 2020, 
possibly due to out-of-the-box failure from the client, with all repair or rework occurring after sales and late delivery 
penalties. For this company to minimize the external failure cost they must invest more in preventative action and 
Appraisal Costs. 
6. Conclusion  
This research only focused on South Africa defense companies. Costs of poor-quality affects defense companies' 
production efficiency, profitability, customer satisfaction and public reputation. To identify and categorize internal 
and external failure costs from various defense organizations as well as establish a method for evaluating the cost of 
poor quality to estimate the impact on an organization. The study confirm that poor quality affects a company's 
profitability, productivity, and customer satisfaction.  
 
In military firms, excessive rework has a significant influence on organizational performance. However, frequent 
rework occurrences, as well as their impact on performance and productivity, should not be considered unavoidable. 
The development of proper awareness as well as organized procedures for rework management may significantly 
improve the unfavorable results associated with rework.  
 
Company profitability and Quality have a strong relationship, according to this research. In fact, for every given 
profitability, better quality yields a larger return on investment. Furthermore, increases in productivity of the company, 
capabilities to meet customer needs, or even other quality characteristics result in higher sales and market share. 
Customers who are happy with the company's quality are more likely to have positive feelings about it than those who 
do not receive high-quality items. Customers who are dissatisfied with a company's quality are more inclined to

impact on the company's brand image when marketing new consumers. 
The study also identifies that the most main causes of poor quality in south Africa defense sector contribute in COPQ 
include Scrap, rework production Orders, cost of monitoring & managing component obsolescence and Warranty 
Charges/Costs. The study also reveal that some employees struggle to measure COPQ, they require help doing the 
measures. It's also possible that the staff don't have the ability to accomplish it. Most of it is mostly due to a shortage 
of resources. One participant agrees, pointing out the issue of resources needed to use the measurements. Even though 
many measures are taken, due to the absence of time and resources to evaluate them, they are not completely utilized. 
Some businesses also have the mindset that ""they don't need to measure."" Measuring the success of a firm is especially 
important if it is doing well. 
The study supports the idea of (Guest, 2017) that Poor quality can lead to a loss of reputation of the company, loss of 
business and a loss of trust from the customer. Poor quality generally causes clients to lose faith in the product or 
service, prompting them to seek out other options. Poor quality can cost an organization a large sum of money. 
Employees would waste their time on inefficient processes and resolving issues on a regular basis if quality is not a 
proactive strategy.

Abstract 
 
Digital Human Modeling (DHM) is one of the important tools used to simulate the workplace for providing ergonomic 
solutions and improved workstation design. Human manikins are built into software, easily manipulated to evaluate 
workstation design and prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. The most common complaints in small scale 
industries are related to MSDs and mismatch between operator and work station. These issues if not resolved early, 
may lead to further serious problems affecting the efficiency and productivity. The present work is taken up to study 
and analyze working posture in nut bolt manufacturing industry by RULA assessment method (Rapid Upper Limb 
Assessment) using CATIA software. The manufacturing of bolts consists of cold forging, trimming, threading and 
heat treatment. The awkward/unnatural postures of operators are assessed for risks using RULA. The actual postures 
are built in CATIA software and possible changes made to show improved postures with low or negligible risks and 
suggest low-cost ergonomic interventions. Suggestions for improvement and low-cost interventions are based on 
ergonomic principles and anthropometry. The overall study highlights that working posture risks can be reduced, if 
proper and timely ergonomic interventions are implemented.

3.0 Conclusion 
The present study was conducted at an bolt manufacturing small scale industry to find out the ergonomic risks and 
postural issues, which may lead to development of MSDs. Two postures which were repeatedly adapted by operator 
at the forging machine were selected for study and analysis. At the oiling of the MS rod and collecting the bolts from 
under the machine, both the postures indicated a high risk of ‘7’as per RULA analysis, which requires immediate 
correction and change to avoid further problems. Low cost ergonomic interventions were recommended as shown in 
Figure 6 and Figure 8. A CATIA model was built with the changed postures and RULA technique was applied to 
analyze the postures. The scores obtained were ‘3’ at the lubricating station and ‘4’while removing the bolts from 
under the machine in improved designed workstation. Thus it is demonstrated that ergonomic interventions are 
necessary to improve the workstation and reducing the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders. Similarly, such 
improvements can be possible at other workstations if interventions are designed and implemented successfully. The 
recommendations made can be implemented to reduce the risks, improve the productivity and efficiency.

Abstract 
This article presents a systematic review of the frequency of appearance of different causes in highway bus accidents, 
for which publications have been searched in SCOPUS and WOS databases. This systematic review has been carried 
out according to the element guidelines. preferred reporting method for systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
(PRISMA). Factors linked to drivers have been considered and grouped into seven major items. The results show that 
the most frequent factors in the publications are those referring to company management, followed by factors linked 
to driving errors. In this way, it is possible to find where to prioritize studies to eliminate the causes of bus accidents 
on highways.

1. Introduction
According to WHO data, in 2016 there were about 1.35 million deaths from traffic accidents, that is, accidents on 
public roads and involving at least one vehicle, and it is the leading cause of death among children and young people 
in between 5 to 29 years (Organization  2018). On the other hand, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 
2013), in recent years, the annual number of deaths from traffic accidents worldwide has remained almost constant, 
despite the fact that the vehicle fleet has suffered a an approximate increase of 15% in the same period, which indicates 
that the effort made in many countries to improve road safety is notorious. Although it is true that road safety has 
improved in many countries, the opposite is true in many developing countries, in which fatalities have increased 
markedly, as is the case in Bangladesh, where the number of people killed by traffic accidents it increased from 1,483 
in 1993 to 4,046 in the year 2000, that is, more than 200% (Barua and Tay  2010) (Barua and Tay 2010), 
Considering the situation only in America, we see that the average mortality rate is 16.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, 
corresponding to 11 per 1,000,000 inhabitants for North America, 20.3 for the countries of the southern cone (Brazil, 
Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay) and 22.1, for the countries of the Andean subregion, where Peru is located 
(WHO  2013).  
Considering now only the buses, it is important to highlight that, with the data provided by the World Health 
Organization (WHO, 2013), the proportion of bus deaths is 0.9% in the United States and 0.5% in the countries of the 
cone. southern Latin America, regarding deaths from accidents, growing significantly in the Andean subregion, where 
a value of 1.6% of fatalities due to traffic accidents involving buses is reached, in relation to the total number of 
fatalities due to traffic accidents. As can be seen, there is a major safety problem on buses in many developing countries 
(Barua and Tay  2010).

Abstract 
Over the last years, several Latin American consumers have been changing their eating habits, opting for healthier 
options, and allowing the emergence of healthy fast-food restaurants. This research aims to determine the key variables 
and actors' developments of healthy fast-food restaurants in the culinary industry within the Lima Metropolitan area, 
with the participation of a group of local experts familiar with the industry and based on a structural analysis that 
evaluates the levels of motor skills and dependency, the interrelationship between the actors and variables for the 
study system was determined. The evidence presents commercial management, communication, lifestyle, age 
distribution, and sale price as influential variables. The social actors responsible for its management are the suppliers, 
the customers, and the local healthy community. The value of this study lies in the practical knowledge it offers to the 
management of healthy restaurants, as well as the possibility of designing and strategic planning of future scenarios 
for the sector. 
Keywords 
Healthy Food, Restaurants, Latin America. 
1. Introduction
Fast food originated in 19th century Europe, when the Cossack mercenaries of the Russian army -in France- requested 
fast service in restaurants by repeating the word bistro (in Russian bystro, which means fast). Since then, French fast-
food restaurants have been known as such. However, this concept only arrived in America at the beginning of the 20th 
century when, in 1912, the first automat was inaugurated in New York; a self-service restaurant offering food behind 
a glass window and a slot to pay with coins. Then, with the arrival in the United States (U.S.) of the popular drive-
through in the 1940s, a period of popularity of this type of service began (Witzel 2002). Years later, in 1955, the first 
restaurant of the first fast food chain was inaugurated: McDonald's (McDonald's 2019). Today, this industry seeks to 
satisfy two main needs: time savings and economic prices. 
The increasing consumption of fast food among adolescents and young adults is a cause for concern due to the high 
intake of fats and carbohydrates that can cause overweight or obesity and subsequently chronic diseases. As stated by 
Kader and Nasirullah (2019), the increase in junk food consumption is a global phenomenon that has a prevalence of 
about 70%. One of the main reasons for this type of food being in such high demand is the affordability of prices, 
followed by the speed of attention of the premises that offer it. In Peru, according to the 2019 family health report of 
the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI), 3 out of every 5 people over 15 years of age are overweight 
and 22.3% are obese. This problem is more severe in Metropolitan Lima, where 64.7% of the population is overweight. 
For this reason, Lázaro and Dominguez (2019) created for the Ministry of Health a food guide for the population

Regarding the first variable, business management, convergences were found against other research. First, as 
suggested by Kang et al. (2015) it is recommended for healthy food restaurants to establish creative marketing 
strategies to motivate customers' interest in menu items and emphasize benefits. Similarly, Liu et al. (2019) determined 
a novel marketing strategy: the use of handwritten typeface on menus, which improves consumers' responses to 
healthy restaurant brands. This is because it creates a competitive advantage by conveying a sense of human touch, 
including positive attitudes towards the menu, a greater perception of brand healthiness and increased engagement on 
social media. According to the study conducted in Spain by Lessa et al. (2017) the communication of the healthy 
restaurant is even more important than that of a conventional one, since consumers usually have the idea that healthy 
food does not taste as good as fast food, so it is vital to promote the restaurant with a message of healthy but tasty 
food and help yourself with good content on social networks (mostly Instagram) where you can place many appetizing 
photos. 
 
In relation to healthy lifestyle, a study by Kang et al. (2015) concluded that the value of health was the key element 
that inspired customers' interest in healthy eating and aroused expectations of hedonic and positive outcomes, which 
in turn enhanced intentions to purchase healthy food in restaurants exclusive to healthy eating. 
 
Finally, for the variables price and age distribution, Newson et al. (2015) conducted a study of international consumers 
to identify barriers and needs in the healthy restaurant industry, where taste, price, and satiety were considered key 
barriers to current healthy choices, and country, age, as well as gender had a strong influence on preferences.  
 
Regarding the most relevant stakeholder, customers, they are responsible for the demand for healthy restaurants. 
According to research by Lebel et al. (2010) they spend about half of their food allocation on eating out, and a little 
more than 15 percent of their meals come from restaurants. Customers are in a quest for healthier and more balanced 
lifestyles, unfortunately for many years health and pleasure have been perceived as irreconcilable motivations for 
eating: if it tastes good, it can't be good and vice versa. It is for this reason that they represent the most influential 
actor, as they are increasingly looking not only for a restaurant with healthy options but also with good quality and 
taste, this consumer has become more demanding as time goes by. 
 
The healthy community is a very important variable, as has been studied for other industries, such as fashion. One 
success story is the company Lululemon, which focused on the healthy community and specifically on people who 
practiced yoga and through a system of collaborations with yoga teachers and studios formed a community that today 
has more than 1 million people. According to former CEO Laurent Potdevin (2018), the success of the brand is not 
about the clothes but about the people and the investment they make through the brand and the intrinsic reward it 
brings them of personal development, a healthier life that allows them to live better - life. 
 
Finally, suppliers play a very important role since they provide the basic ingredients for the restaurant menu, most of 
which are imported, so if there is a poor relationship with them or there are delays in lead time, there could be problems 
in the acquisition of essential ingredients. Murphy et al. (2009) in their research collected data from executive chefs 
through surveys and personal interviews, and documented producer-chef relationships, why and how ingredients are 
presented in menu lists, and how chefs communicate ingredient usage to their customers. The results also describe 
potential issues related to supplier usage and their perceptions of customer expectations for their meals. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The research results yielded the most relevant variables for the health food industry in the context studied: commercial 
management, communication, lifestyle, age distribution and sales price; and the actors that play the most influential 
role: suppliers, customers, and the healthy community. An important finding is that three of the five key variables are 
internal, while only two are external, which may suggest that in this industry the differentiating factor of each 
restaurant and the value proposition provided to customers is more important than the external factors already known. 
 
Although this research is focused on the area of Metropolitan Lima, it could serve as a reference for other Latin 
American countries due to the similarity in consumer behavior in this region. Similarly, researchers are invited to 
address this topic of study for their countries and with the scope they require, since the health food industry is emerging 
and could undergo strong changes over the years.

It can also be stated that the system under study is stable, since the input and output variables are well defined and the 
dynamics are easy to identify. Furthermore, as proposed by Godet (2007), there is a predominance of driving variables. 
Finally, it should be noted that this industry does not show seasonality, since consumption is relatively stable 
throughout the year. 
 
Finally, as a recommendation, this research can be used to propose future scenarios for this industry through the Prob 
Expert software, which uses the probabilistic cross-impact method to help determine events by simulating risks.

1. Introduction
Autonomous vehicles (AV) are becoming increasingly prevalent and affect transportation, safety, security, and energy 
management considerably. AVs are enabled by technologies that allow them to operate without human input. 
According to SAE J3016 (SAE 2018), a standard used in the automotive industry, categorizes self-driving vehicles 
into six levels of autonomy, ranging from level 0 (no self-driving features) to level 5 (fully autonomous driving). AV 
differs from conventional cars in that they have more sensors to detect their environment, the computer takes over 
steering control, and they can communicate with other vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians through V2X 
technology (where X represents other vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians, etc.) (Weiß 2011). This type of technology 
helps improve efficiency and reduce costs, enhance safety, and reduce the risk of accidents (Onu and Mbohwa 2021). 
By relying on this technology, AVs can drive more efficiently, providing a better and safer experience for everyone 
involved. Additionally, AVs have the potential to enhance the efficiency of the transportation system through their 
ability to perceive and respond to the environment more quickly, leading to the ability to maintain smaller distances 
between vehicles and thereby increasing road capacity (Shi and Prevedouros 2016). The sensors on an AV, such as 
radar, camera, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, play a crucial role in detecting the vehicle's 
movements and surrounding environment.

598","The challenges associated with collecting data must be considered when training a network to forecast traffic flow. 
This is particularly true for vehicles traveling at very slow or high speeds and situations where roads may be empty 
during the forecast period. These difficulties are often not addressed in studies, leading to incomplete and corrupted 
data. To overcome these issues, it is necessary to implement a sophisticated method of measuring forecasting errors. 
Most studies rely on loop detectors and sensors to collect data on traffic flow (Kim and Coifman 2017).  
However, owing to nascent technologies, GPS-based systems offer a more comprehensive and dynamic picture of 
traffic flow due to their high-dimensional, non-linear, and spatial-temporal features. Additionally, GPS technology 
has a low cost of installation compared to other data sources, making it an attractive option for analysis. Moreover, 
those onboard AVs must maintain communication with the vehicle. Further research examining the interaction 
between humans and AVs in mixed-traffic scenarios is imperative. 
6. Conclusions
This paper comprehensively reviews the current literature on autonomous vehicle (AV) safety, security, and energy 
management. It gives an overview of the strategies involved and highlights the policy and planning considerations 
that must be considered. The review identifies the challenges and opportunities related to improving AVs' safety, 
security, and energy efficiency. The authors also discuss the need to address several key policy and planning 
considerations, such as data privacy, the use of AI and ML in AVs, the protection of public infrastructure, the transition 
of workers, and the impact of new technological advancements. The paper comprehensively examines Autonomous 
Vehicle Safety, Security, and Energy Management: A Review, Challenges, and Solutions.
